["sports", "Ali\u2019s conviction for draft evasion was overturned in 1971 - NY Daily News (Originally published by the Daily News on June 29, 1971. This story was written by Phil Pepe.) Muhammad Ali is a free man, free to go anywhere he wants, free to fight where and whom he pleases, and for as long as he pleases. Exactly three months and 20 days after losing a unanimous decision to Joe Frazier in his biggest fight in the ring, Muhammad Ali won a unanimous decision in an even bigger fight. The Supreme Court voted, 8-0 (Justice Marshall disqualified himself because he was solicitor general when the government brought its case against Ali) to overturn Ali\u2019s conviction on charges of draft evasion, a conviction that carried with it a $10,000 fine and a five year prison term that would certainly have ended the boxing career of the former heavyweight champion of the world. If justice was served in Washington, then what was served the 3 \u00bd years Muhammad lost out of his boxing life when he was stripped of his title and his right to fight after his conviction by the government?  Ali\u2019s conviction for draft evasion was overturned in 1971  When Ali earned reported $30,000 to $40,000 a year as a public speaker during his absence from the right, that was merely a pittance compared to what he might have made in the ring or in commercial endorsements during what would have been the most productive years of his athletic life."]
["sports", "Typically, the two organizations that were quick to rush judgement and strip him of his title and his principal means of earning a living following the conviction, were just as quick to issue statements of approbation following the verdict of the Supreme Court. Pointing out that he wasn\u2019t in on the original decision to strip Ali of his title, Bill Brennan, president of the World Boxing Assn., said in Miami that he will recommend Muhammad be named the WBA\u2019s No. 1 challenger to titleholder Frazier. Ali has not been listed in the WBA monthly ratings since his conviction. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in on the decision,\u201d Brennan said, \u201cbut in my heart I did agree with it. Now the court has changed all that and so I have to be in agreement with them if I want to be a citizen of this country. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d  Ali was convicted for draft evasion in 1967  Similarly, Edwin B. Dooley, chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, which followed the WBA\u2019s lead in stripping Ali of his title, welcomed Muhammad back in the commission\u2019s good graces. He said: \u201cThe New York State Athletic Commission is grateful that the Muhammad Ali matter with reference to his selective service draft status has been finally qualified by the Supreme Court and he can pursue his career without further problems.\u201d While it seems to some that Ali can institute legal action against the WBA and New York State Athletic Commission for their precipitous action in stripping him of his title, it is unlikely Muhammad will take such action."]

So I\u2019m just thankful to the Supreme Being, that\u2019s all.\u201d In New York last week to publicize the Ellis fight, Ali said he was prepared to go to jail and would accept his fate if the Supreme Court upheld the conviction. \u201cI would be proud because I went to jail for a cause and I would just be a famous prisoner.\u201d He also said, at the time, he had two plans for the future - to be restored in good faith by Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad and to regain his title from Frazier after three other fights, then retire from the ring.

One of Martin Shkreli\u2019s investors recalled a 2010 chat when the man asked the Pharma Bro if he had feelings for him. Steven Richardson \u2014 a man who told Brooklyn federal jurors he\u2019s had a domestic partner for 25 years \u2014 testified Tuesday he wondered if Shkreli\u2019s quips about hookups and sex were just ploys to strike a rapport with the 63-year-old investor. \u201cHe was saying thing to me like, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll have sex with a guy in the office,\u2019\u201d Richardson said. \u201cOr we\u2019d be at a restaurant and there\u2019d be waiter and he\u2019d say, \u2018Maybe I should hook up with him.\u2019\u201d  Ex-Shkreli workers call Pharma Bro a scammer who flaked on bills  \u201cI thought maybe he started saying things to me because he thought I would want to hear them,\u201d said Richardson, who invested more than $400,000 with Shkreli. It got to the point that Richardson had to have a March 2010 talk with Shkreli, 34. After cocktails at Richardson\u2019s Chelsea apartment, he said he sat Shkreli down on his bed. \u201cI said, \u2018Do you have any physical feelings for me?\u2019 He took a second he said, \u2018No, I like you a lot but I don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d  Ex-Shkreli worker testifies about his nasty moods at fraud trial  Richardson said that was the answer he \u201cexpected to hear and wanted to hear,\u201d happy to know what they had \u201cwas a purely platonic friendship.\u201d"]

Richardson later became a Retrophin board member. Last week, prosecutors called Dr. Lindsay Rosenwald to discuss how his $100,000 investment with Shkreli turned out. Rosenwald ended up with Retrophin stock that he ended up selling for between $400,000 and $600,000. One of Shkreli\u2019s 2012 emails to Rosenwald hit him up for a dating lead.

["sports", "Ali was convicted for draft evasion in 1967 - NY Daily News (Originally published by the Daily News on June 21, 1967.) HOUSTON, June 20 \u2014 Heavyweight champ Cassius Clay, unbeaten in a glamorous boxing career, was convicted today by an all-white jury on a charge of refusing induction into the military service and a federal judge promptly sentenced him to five years in prison. Clay, 25, a descendant of a runaway Kentucky slave, in a surprise move, asked Judge Joe Ingraham to sentence him immediately after the jury deliberated only 21 minutes. Standing erect in front of a gray-haired juristy, Clay said in a subdued tone: \u201cI\u2019d like to say I would appreciate it if the court would sentence me now instead of waiting.\u201d  Ali stripped of his title for refusing to join the army in 1967  However, the maneuver appeared to be a formality since attorneys immediately said they would appeal the case and Clay left the court on the same $5,000 bond he had been under since May 8, when he was indicted. Ingraham also fined Clay $10,000. \u201cI\u2019m going to impose the maximum penalty,\u201d the judge said. Ingraham added, however that under normal practice if an appeal is not successful, motions are made to reduce any sentence.  Ali\u2019s conviction for draft evasion was overturned in 1971  The jury of six men and six women deliberated only 20 minutes to end a trial that lasted less than two days and had included less than five hours of testimony by only eight witnesses. Clay did not take the stand."]
["sports", "Clay and his attorneys had challenged the legality of his 1-A draft classification on grounds he is a Black Muslim minister named Muhammad Ali. As the jury told the judge it had reached a verdict, Clay opened his big brown, expressive eyes widely, staring across the courtroom. He was asked by Ingraham to stand, an order with which he quickly complied. When the word \u201cguilty\u201d was heard from the jury foreman, Clay lowered his eyes slightly, then leaned over and coughed faintly. Hayed Covington, his chief attorney from New York City, announced,\u201dwe\u2019re ready for sentencing now.\u201d There were a brief round of discussion as Clay stood before the bench with his attorneys and U.S. attorney Morton L. Susman. The discussion centered on whether Clay had been influenced by the Black Muslim sect. \u201cTo my knowledge here is a man who has never been charged with any criminal act except minor traffic violation,\u201d Susman said. Susman then noted that Clay had won a gold medal as an Olympic boxing champion in 1961 and then went on to win the heavyweight championship of the world in 1964. Susman said Clay became a Black Muslim in 1964 and \u201cin my opinion that\u2019s where his troubles began. I think that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s here, his being in the Muslims.\u201d Clay broke in and said, \u201cIf I may say so, my religion is not political in any way.\u201d Ingraham quickly interrupted Clay and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be heard in due order.\u201d"]
["sports", "Covington then said the U.S. Constitution guarantees that a man has a right to the religion of his choice. \u201cHe is not under their influence,\u201d Covington said. Clay had refused to take the traditional induction symbol of one step forward April 28 in Houston. He was inducted May 8 and his attorneys built his defense around contentions the heavyweight champion spends only 10% of his time as a boxer and 90% as a minister. Covington told the court that, in effect, Clay is a \u201ctraveling\u201d bishop for the religious sect. But Judge Ingraham, in his 30-minute charge to the jury, said the only question they had to decide was whether Clay knowingly and unlawfully refused induction. Ingraham noted specifically it was not the duty of the jury to decide whether the defendant was due an exemption from the draft because of his religion. \u201cThe court has read the draft board file and has found there was a basis in fact for 1-A classification,\u201d Ingraham told the jurors. \u201cYou are not to consider this.\u201d Ingraham had made such a finding while turning down a defense motion for an instructed verdict of acquittal.

The Pittsburgh native and former Pirate returned to his hometown to enthusiastic applause Friday night, but after homering twice to his favorite right field corner and driving in four runs in the Mets 8-1 win, he had worn out his welcome. Jacob deGrom dominated for 8.1 innings, the first Mets starter to go at least eight innings this season. The Mets (20-26) snapped a two-game losing streak and a six-game road skid. DeGrom held the Pirates to a run on six hits. He walked one and struck out 10. And Walker, who was worn out by emotions and demands on his time last season when he came back for the first time after being traded, made it a memorable night.  As Jacob deGrom returns to form, Mets need arms to keep giving  \u201cI was able to get ahead of things,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI knew what to expect some of the off the field stuff. More than that, I was much less anxious tonight than I was last year. Walker, whose father settled in Pittsburgh after playing for the Pirates, homered twice and singled driving in four runs Friday, one shy of his career high. That pushed him over the 500-RBI mark for his career. It was his fifth career multi-home run game. They were the first two home runs Walker hit in PNC Park since he was dealt by the team that drafted him back in 2004 to the Mets for lefty starter Jon Niese."]

Reyes scored again after tripling in the fifth, on Jay Bruce\u2019s sacrifice fly, right before Walkers\u2019 second shot of the night.  Mets send Rafael Montero to minors to make room for Tyler Pill  Walker, an avid Pittsburgh sports fan who was still celebrating the Penguins Eastern Conference championship, is hitting .344 with eight doubles, a triple, four home runs and 18 RBI in 22 games in May. \u201cI got to my house about 4 a.m. and got to sleep in my own bed, which was nice,\u201d Walker said, before adding with a smile, \"and (daughter Nora) got up at 7 a.m. Happy to be home.\u201d Tired or not, Walker led an impressive offense from the Mets.

He drove in two more runs in the sixth on a double over the head of Pirates right fielder Gregory Polanco\u2019s head.  Mets' Michael Conforto every bit as impressive as Aaron Judge   DeGrom made all that offense stand up with not only his longest start of the season, but his most impressive.

An ambitious MTA plan to rescue the subway from collapse may get scaled back for lack of funding, the head of the MTA said Wednesday. Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Joe Lhota said he'll tell transit agency board members next month how he plans to pay for his $836 million subway action plan, which includes hiring 2,700 workers. Lhota, who unveiled his plan two months ago, said he'll also show what work will get top priority if he can't get any assurances the cash he needs will be there. \"We'll be able to see what can be done, what can't be done, if we're unsuccessful in getting the full amount of money,\" Lhota told the MTA board Wednesday. He vowed not to \"spend one penny more\" than what's now in this year's budget. Lhota refused to say what work could be derailed. \"We'll put out the prioritization of which things we expect can get done,\" Lhota told reporters after the meeting. \"I am not going to lead with my chin and say, we'll this gets done or this doesn't get done, based on who gives what.\" Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor de Blasio, said Lhota should not expect a check from the city, citing the money that the state swept from the MTA."]
["new-york", "\"Try as they might, city riders won't allow the state and the MTA to pull the wool over their eyes,\" Finan said. \"Implementing half the plan isn't an option.\" The plan aims to tackle the sources of the most disruptive problems in the subway, like its aging signal system and track issues. So far, the MTA has hired 300 workers for its plan. Chief financial officer, Bob Foran, said new revenue is needed so that the agency can sustain hiring in the long run. In the short term, Foran said the MTA can rely on overtime, contract work and drawing money from reserves. But without the long-term funding, \"we'll reduce what we can spend to stay within a financial plan,\" he said. Board members pressured the MTA brass to think more creatively about funding the subway rescue plan. \"Are there ways we can do things more affordably, efficiencies to be gained? Are there other priorities the agency can reshuffle?\" asked Polly Trottenberg, the city's transportation commissioner and de Blasio's rep on the MTA board. \"I would like as a board member to be given more options than just the binary \u2014 the city pays half or we don't do any of it.\" MTA board member Andrew Saul asked for a historical head count of the agency's workforce. \"The answer may not be just throwing more people at these things,\" said Saul, of Westchester County.

The world\u2019s third-ranked player didn\u2019t find it at Oakmont. McIlroy missed the cut on Saturday after posting a two-round total of 8-over 148, two clear of the cut line at 6 over. The 2011 U.S. Open champion followed up a disastrous 7-over 77 in the gloom on Thursday and early Friday with a wildly uneven 1-over 71. Starting on the back nine, McIlroy birdied four of his first seven holes to get back to 3 over and send a jolt into the gallery that a hot streak not unlike the four rounds he put together at Congressional five years ago was in the making. Only this time, it didn\u2019t happen.  Dustin Johnson saves USGA from embarrassment  Whatever momentum McIlroy generated disappeared on the par-4 4th, when it took him four jabs of the putter to get in from 13 feet. He bogeyed the par-3 6th but arrived on the tee box at the par-4 9th right on the number. A leaky drive put him in a fairway sand trap. He had 158 yards to the flag when his approach shot hit the lip of the bunker and trickled back toward his feet.

["sports/more-sports", "Dustin Johnson saves USGA from embarrassment - NY Daily News Whatever level of elation Dustin Johnson had to be feeling on Sunday evening, after finally overcoming his many crash-and-burn failures in majors, it may not have compared to the sense of relief among the dopes running the U.S. Open. After all, Johnson\u2019s brilliant, drama-free finish spared the United States Golf Association the mother of all embarrassments, potentially allowing its most prestigious tournament to end without anyone knowing the final score. For a long time late Sunday afternoon it appeared that\u2019s exactly where this U.S. Open was headed, after golf\u2019s ruling body made an incredibly dumb non-ruling on whether to assess Johnson a one-stroke penalty. On the 12th tee at the famed Oakmont Country Club, six holes after Johnson\u2019s ball moved ever so slightly on the fifth green, a rules official informed the player that the USGA saw cause to assess the penalty.  Dustin Johnson overcomes rules controversy to win U.S. Open  But nothing would be determined until after Johnson viewed a videotape of the situation following the round, and he had a chance to convince them there should be no penalty. All of this after a different official had ruled at the time of the incident, on the fifth green, that Johnson\u2019s preparation to putt had not caused the ball to move, and thus there was no cause for penalty."]
["sports/more-sports", "OK, so we\u2019ve all become accustomed to video replay overturning decisions made on the field of play, but the absurdity here was in not making a definitive decision, leaving everyone wondering as to what was Johnson\u2019s actual score. All of which left Johnson and a handful of other players (who were informed of the situation), tightly bunched until the very end, not knowing exactly where they stood as they played the last several holes.  Paulina Gretzky's white dress causes a stir at U.S. Open  That could have affected strategy in so many ways for either Johnson or the others, and left everyone waiting at the end for a ruling that could have changed the outcome. You knew this was the height of insanity when Brad Faxon, who was doing commentary on Fox, called the situation \u201cridiculous.\u201d' You never hear such criticism from former PGA Tour players in such high-profile settings, but this was unlike anything anyone had ever seen. Right or wrong, obviously the USGA needed to make a call and resolve the uncertainty. Of course, it did make for compelling drama, all the more so because Johnson was in the middle of it.  Jordan Spieth wears Steph Curry\u2019s daddy shoes at U.S. Open  He lost a chance to be in a playoff in the 2010 PGA Championship over a similar ruling, when he was assessed a two-stroke penalty at the tournament\u2019s end for unwittingly grounding his club in a waste area that was regarded as a sand bunker."]
["sports/more-sports", "At the time, Johnson seemed poised to be the next dominant player in the sport, with spectacular length off the tee that allowed him to overpower courses much as Tiger Woods did in his prime. Instead, it turned out to be a foreshadowing of his many failures in majors, including missing a three-foot putt on the 18th green a year ago in the U.S. Open that would have put him in a playoff with Jordan Spieth. In some ways, Johnson had become the Alex Rodriguez of golf, unable to deliver on his brilliant talent when the stakes were highest, much like A-Rod all those years in the post-season before he finally played such a huge role in leading the Yankees to the 2009 championship.  Dustin Johnson's team mixes up PGA endorsements  Like A-Rod, Johnson had his off-the-course issues as well, taking a much-publicized leave of absence two years ago for what Golf.com reported as a drug-related suspension by the PGA Tour for testing positive for cocaine. With all of this as a backdrop, Sunday\u2019s bizarre non-ruling seemed to set the stage for another missed opportunity. Instead, Johnson raised the level of his game and played the way so many in golf had been waiting for, finishing strong over the final holes while the other contenders fell victim to Oakmont\u2019s long rough and slick greens. Still, there was doubt, especially with the penalty stroke looming, until Johnson hit his seven-iron approach on No. 18 to within three feet of the hole, setting up a final birdie that clinched the victory."]

As it turned out, Johnson was indeed assessed the penalty stroke afterward, though at that point he had no reason to argue that he hadn\u2019t caused the ball to move, since the penalty simply reduced his margin of victory to three strokes. So good for Johnson. He easily could have given in to his major-tournament demons and allowed all the penalty-stroke uncertainty to mess with his mojo. Instead, he removed his name from the top of the list of best players never to win a major. More certain than that, he surely ensured change in such future rulings. Even the stuffy USGA had to realize the lunacy it created on Sunday, and how fortunate it was to not be even more of a laughingstock. \u00a0"]

Petitions have poured in from New Yorkers and from citizens around the country who have joined The News' family of readers through the paper's digital edition. This passionate flood bespeaks a truth that National Rifle Association leaders have so effectively bullied out of the halls of power: Americans ache for gun controls even as they respect the Second Amendment. Americans are desperate to stop the madmen of Sandy Hook, Aurora, Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson and so many other killing fields, past and future, from getting their hands on battlefield-style firearms. Americans pray for an end to the trafficking in illegal handguns that routinely kill in ones and twos and threes every day.

Those parties are the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York and defendant Phil Kenner, an investment guru accused of fraud and money laundering. Last week Kenner made the unusual choice of taking the witness stand in his own defense, opening himself up to potentially penetrating cross-examination that began late Monday. \u201cYou understand that the indictment charges you with stealing, correct,\u201d assistant U.S. Attorney James Miskiewicz asked Kenner, who has been jailed in New York since his arrest in Arizona in November 2013. Miskiewicz had about one hour to interrogate Kenner before the jury was excused until Tuesday morning, when Kenner\u2019s cross-examination will resume. Defendants are not required to testify in their own trials, and Kenner\u2019s co-defendant, Tommy Constantine, is not expected to take the stand. The trial began in April and has outrun U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bianco\u2019s initial estimate of six weeks. Miskiewicz cornered Kenner in a self-contradiction regarding a series of line-of-credit loans that Kenner had controlled on behalf of his hockey clients \u2014 loans that in many cases defaulted, leaving players like former Islanders star Michael Peca with little warning as the Northern Trust bank seized their savings, which had been put up as collateral."]
["sports/i-team", "Under Miskiewicz\u2019s questioning, Kenner said he\u2019d received transaction history reports for the loans in 2009. Then Miskiewicz reminded Kenner of a 2012 phone call \u2014 secretly recorded by Peca\u2019s wife, Kristin, and played for the jury last month \u2014 in which Kenner claimed that he didn\u2019t possess any of the documents related to the loans, and that Kristin Peca would need to go to the bank to get them. Many of Miskiewicz\u2019s questions focused on an exclusive golf resort in Mexico that is one of the real estate projects at the center of the case. In 2009 Kenner told his clients, including more than a dozen hockey players, that money they had invested in Diamante Cabo San Lucas had been squandered by the resort\u2019s developer, Ken Jowdy, who has not testified in the case. Kenner said he loaned \u201cin the neighborhood of five-and-a-half million\u201d of his and the hockey players\u2019 money to Jowdy that wasn\u2019t repaid. But Miskiewicz got Kenner to admit there was little documentation of the loan beyond a promissory note that Miskiewicz strongly implied was a \u201cphony\u201d document. \u201cDocumentation of lending and borrowing money is kind of important, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Miskiewicz asked, wondering how it was possible that among 89,000 text messages and 287,000 computer documents swept up by the FBI and IRS that there was not more proof of the loan. \u201cI talked to my clients on the phone a lot,\u201d Kenner said. \u201cI traveled 250 days a year to meet with them face to face.\u201d"]

'Pharma Bro' Shkreli pleads not guilty to security fraud charges Shkreli is charged with defrauding investors of the pharmaceutical company Retrophin along with the company's former counsel Evan Greebel. \"Mr. Greebel wore two hats during the relevant time period, he was Retrophin's counsel and Mr. Shkreli's personal counsel,\" Brafman told Judge Kiyo Matsumoto. Brafman said there are meticulous, \"minute-by-minute\" phone logs documenting calls between Greebel and Shkreli, and that Greebel billed millions of dollars in fees \"in what I believe is the heart of the case.\" Greebel is likely to ask for a separate trial, too, although he did not say so in court.

Outside court, Brafman said his client was not accusing Greebel of wrongdoing. \"I don't believe there is a finger of blame to point,\" he said. \"Our client relied on his advice and that doesn't necessarily mean that either committed a crime.\" The criminal charges have nothing to do with the pricing of the AIDS drug."]

["sports/baseball/mets", "Mets GM Sandy Alderson deserves credit for finding Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman Sandy Alderson's first draft as Mets' GM may always be remembered most for taking first-rounder Brandon Nimmo one pick ahead of Jose Fernandez. Or maybe not. A few weeks ago, after all, most fans had barely heard of Robert Gsellman and Seth Lugo. But after each of them shut down the Nationals the last two nights, with Lugo nothing short of brilliant in going seven innings on Sunday night, together they are nothing short of a godsend to the Mets, helping vault them very much into the wild-card chase. Both were also late-round picks by the Alderson regime in that 2011 draft. Actually, late is perhaps too broad a term. There's late and then there's throw-a-dart-at-the-draft-board late. That was Lugo, selected in the 34th round \u2014 the 1,032nd pick overall, out of Centenary College in Louisiana, where he had a less-than-impressive career ERA of 5.31. Suffice to say he's come an awful long way from those days. Called up to be used as a reliever in July, Lugo has since been forced into the injury-decimated starting rotation, and in four starts, including Sunday night's 5-1 win over the Nationals, he is 3-1 with a 2.19 ERA. With him and Gsellman in the rotation, in fact, the Mets have won 11 of 15 games to move within one game of the Cardinals for the second wild-card spot, and 2\u00bd of the Giants for the first spot."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "And with an easy schedule ahead while the Cardinals and Pirates have a lot of games with each, not to mention the Cubs, the obvious question is: Who starts the wild-card game, Gsellman or Lugo? Yes, that's a joke, in case Noah Syndergaard happens to see this. But you get the idea. Thanks largely to these couple of no-name pitchers, suddenly this team seems to have a little of that 2015 magic going here late in the season. \"I'm real proud of them,'' Collins said after Sunday's win. \"We're in a pennant race and they're making it fun.'' He was speaking of his team but he could have been speaking specifically of Gsellman and Lugo. Who'd have thought? Gsellman, a high school pitcher out of Los Angeles in 2011, was a blue-chipper compared to Lugo, selected in the 13th round with the 402nd overall pick that year. He had an average fastball but the Mets thought his athleticism \u2014 he was the shooting guard on his state championship basketball team \u2014 gave him a chance for growth, and when he concentrated solely on baseball, his velocity jumped from the high 80s to low 90s. Perhaps more significantly, he learned to throw a two-seam fastball with sink that became his ticket to the majors. Collins called it \"as good a sinker as I've seen'' after Gsellman allowed one run in six innings Saturday night against the Nationals."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "Lugo wasn't impressive in college, but he was a big kid, now 6-foot-4, 225 pounds, whose fastball velocity was increasing. When he consistently threw 93-94 mph at a showcase event before the 2011 draft, the Mets decided to take a flyer on him. A back injury that required surgery cost him a year in the minors, as he missed the 2012 season, but Lugo improved steadily from there. Still, going into this spring he seemed to be just another minor-leaguer, and no kid at age 26. In fact, he was giving up so many hits in Triple-A Las Vegas \u2014 103 hits in 73.1 innings \u2014 this season that the Mets weren't sure he could survive as a starter in the big leagues, and called him up as a reliever in July. Still, he threw hard, threw strikes, and the dry, high-altitude conditions in Vegas made it difficult for him to command his pitches, particularly his sharp-breaking curveball. \"I don't like to make excuses,'' Lugo said after the win Sunday, \"but it's just different there. I'm from Lousiana. I'm used to pitching with humidity.'' The Mets saw a difference immediately when they brought him up. His stuff was more crisp, with better command. So they took a shot with him as a starter, and so far the results have been rather astonishing. Lugo doesn't appear to be overpowering, with his fastball mostly in the 92-93 range, but occasionally he blows it past hitters at 96."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "\"If I go max effort all the time, I'll start throwing the ball all over the place,'' he said. \"But I'll use it when I think guys are going to swing at it.'' Lugo laughed. He was savoring his finest moment late Sunday night, and why not? These are giddy days for the Mets, seemingly left for dead due to all the injuries only a couple of weeks ago. Instead, as Colins said, they've found pitching where they didn't expect it in Lugo and Gsellman. \"Both of these guys have really stepped up for us,'' he said. For now at least, they've also raised the grade for Alderson's first Met draft, no matter what Nimmo does in the coming years."]

Long before his widely despised rants against Warren, Trump used racially-charged language to describe Native American competitors in the casino business.

The ads described the Mohawks as criminals and drug dealers.

["", "Frazier pounds out win over Muhammad Ali in 1971 - NY Daily News (Originally published by the Daily News on Tuesday, March 9, 1971; written by Phil Pepe) Muhammad Ali came to war, not to dance. It was a mistake. He learned you can't rumble with a street fighter, and because he tried, he came off the canvas in the 15th round, but suffered his first defeat in 32 fights as a pro and a possible fractured cheekbone and Joe Frazier has the heavyweight championship all to himself. Smokin' Joe pounded out a unanimous 15-round decision over Ali before a packed, celebrity-studded crowd at the Garden last night and stands alone on top of the heavyweight crowd. He did it with his typical, two-fisted, never-retreat attack and he left no doubt that in a slugging match he is the better man . . . the best man in his business. The two judges made it a convincing victory for Joe, his 27th without defeat as a pro and only the fourth time he failed to put his opponent away. Bill Recht had Frazier ahead, 11-4, Artie Aidala voted for Frazier, 9-6, referee Arthur Mercante had it much closer, 8-6-1, but cast the unanimous vote for the winner. THE NEWS card had it even, 7-7-1, but gave Frazier a huge edge on points because of the more damaging punches. MUHAMMAD ALI TKOs JOE FRAZIER IN 14TH IN 1975 THRILLA"]
["", "ONE OF THOSE damaging punches came in the final round . . . a long, looping left that caught Ali flush on the chin, possibly breaking his jaw. It sent the former champ to the canvas, dazed and in serious trouble. But, instinctively, he bounced up at the count of three and took the mandatory eight count on his feet. Frazier tried desperately to put over the clincher for the more than two minutes that remained in the fight. Ali was wobbly, reeling all over the ring, but his fighting instincts kept him on his feet. He held, he tried to dance, he even struck back, a series of feeble punches that managed to occupy Frazier long enough to keep him from delivering the solid blow that would surely end it. By then, Frazier was arm weary and peering out of slits in his head that substituted for eyes. His left eye was swollen and almost completely closed, his right eye was half closed and his lips were puffed. His face looked like a death mask, but it turned out to be a victory mask when the end came. IRONICALLY, although he took the heavier pounding, Ali had no marks on his face until the savage 15th round left hook swelled the right side of his cheek twice its normal size. For some reason, possibly because he was concerned about his ability to maintain a furious pace through 15 rounds, Ali abandoned his usual \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\" style. He was not the stick and move, bicycling Ali he had been before his three and a half-year layoff, and that was his undoing."]
["", "He chose to stand and bang with Frazier although he had to know he must come out second best. There were times when Ali taunted Frazier, waving him on, asking to be hit. Joe whaled away with both hands, but most of the shots - long, looping lefts like the climactic one - were picked off on the arms or gloves or on the back of Muhammad's head. FRAZIER DUCKS ALI TALK ON 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 'FIGHT OF THE CENTURY' AND ALI WAS taking Frazier's best shots and coming back for more, beating him to the punch, popping fix, six, seven shots and getting just one in return. In the 11th round, Frazier back Ali into the ropes, as he had done often throughout the fight. This time, Joe had Ali in a neutral corner and Muhammad was content to stay there, to let Frazier smoke away. Nothing happened. Ali slipped punches. Instead of trying to fight his way out or dance his way out, he stayed there. Frazier ripped lefts and rights and Ali ducked, slipped or picked shots off on his gloves. He dared Frazier to hit him . . . again . . . and again. Finally Frazier connected, a devastating hook to the chin and Ali was rubber-legged. Or was he? He reeled and stumbled about the ring as if being supported by jellied legs. But he didn't go down. Was he faking? You never know with Ali. Either he was just one punch from being taken out or he was an even greater actor than people have given him credit for."]
["", "HE SURVIVED  that round and was talking to his corner. He seemed all right, and he came out fighting in the 12th and held his own although losing the round on the cards of two judges. Ali had his moments. The biggest one came in the ninth round. He opened up a series of one-twos and a left-right combination to the head buckled Frazier's knees. But Ali could not put over any more punches that might have turned his imminent defeat into victory. That was to be Ali's last big round, and Frazier added to his lead by winning the 10th on one card, the 11th big on all three official cards, the 12th on two cards, the 13th on two cards and the 15th big on all three cards. If Ali surprised everybody by going right to Frazier at the opening bell, he surprised no one by talking a good fight. He started before the first bell. While waiting for the introductions, he danced over to Frazier and said, \"Chump.\" FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE. HE TAUNTED Frazier, daring him to \"come on, hit me,\" saying \"You can't hit.\" Before the eighth, the crowd chanted \"Ali, Ali, Ali,\" and Muhammad raised his right hand straight up. Several times, when he picked off left hooks on the gloves or Frazier's blows did not land flush, the crowd roared and Ali turned to ringside and shook his head, \"no,\" as if to say he wasn't hurt, the blows were ineffectual."]

["news/national", "No answers, new legal disputes one month after Rhoden family murders in Ohio\u00a0 More than a month after eight members of a rural Ohio family were slaughtered on their isolated farms, police still have no answers about the massacre \u2014 and the case is now descending into legal chaos. A new probate court filing related to the Rhoden family murders is expected this week, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, though it is unclear which aspect of the convoluted case it will cover. With no suspects, no arrests and no clear motivation for the April 22 shootings, officials are now looking into other lingering mysteries from the case \u2014 specifically, who will handle the family's 74-acre estate and who will care for the young survivors. Eight members of the Rhoden family \u2014 ranging in age from 16 to 44 \u2014 were found dead from gunshot wounds in four locations on the family's Piketon properties. Police called the killings \"pre-planned executions,\" and said all but one family member suffered multiple gunshot wounds. One victim was shot nine times. But three of the family's youngest members \u2014 Kylie Rhoden, 5; Brentley Rhoden, 3; and 6-month-old Ruger Rhoden \u2014 were found unharmed at the scene of the slayings. Sophia Wagner, the 2-year-old daughter of one victim, was staying with a relative on the night of the massacre and was not harmed.

With the NFL draft approaching quickly, it's time to look at some of the new faces getting ready to enter the NFL and how they will impact not only their new teams but Fantasy owners as well. In no particular order, here are some of the rookies that will end up being the top draft picks. Deshaun Watson- Quarterback- Clemson- After winning a National title with Clemson, Watson is ready to go pro and could be drafted by any one of several teams with a Top 3 pick in need of a quarterback. The Browns have the first overall pick and need a quarterback desperately. Even though there aren't many weapons on the offensive side of the ball in Cleveland, Watson would become an instant late-round draft pick in Fantasy as a proven playmaker at the college level. Watson finished his three years at Clemson with over 10,000 passing yards and 90 touchdowns. The 49ers and Bears also have Top 3 picks in the draft and could choose Watson if he's available."]
["amp/sports/football", "Mitchell Trubisky- Quarterback- North Carolina- If the Browns select Watson with the first overall pick, there is a good chance that the former Tar Heel could be the next player drafted. Trubisky would be in a similar situation as Watson as the Browns, 49ers and Bears all are lacking talent on the offensive side of the ball. Trubisky probably wouldn't make a Fantasy impact right away, but he has the tools to get the job done in the NFL and for Fantasy owners. He finished his college career at North Carolina with almost 5,000 passing yards and 41 touchdowns, including 30 in his Senior year. Without the talent to help him out in Cleveland, San Francisco or Chicago he will have a hard time gaining the trust of Fantasy owners in his rookie season. Emma Watson says the Beast character was 'hot' Dalvin Cook- Running Back- Florida- When the Jaguars pick at number four, Cook could be the first running back off the board since the Jaguars don't seem to have a back they can trust. In the three years Cook played at Florida, he amassed almost 5,000 yards on the ground and made 79 catches for almost 1,000 yards while scoring 48 total touchdowns. His presence would help Blake Bortles and the Jaguars' offense immensely, as Bortles would have a ground game to complement the passing attack. Cook would take the pressure off their pass-only offense and he would immediately win over Fantasy owners with his ability."]
["amp/sports/football", "Leonard Fournette- Running Back- LSU- Fournette finished his college career with almost 4,000 yards on the ground and 41 total touchdowns. The former LSU product could be selected over Cook and head to Jacksonville, where he too would make an immediate impact for Fantasy owners. If the Jaguars don't take Fournette with the fourth pick, he could slide down to ninth overall for Cincinnati, or another team may trade up to acquire him since none of the teams after the Jaguars really need a running back (Titans, Jets, Chargers, Panthers). Regardless of where Fournette ends up, Fantasy owners can be sure he will make a difference right out of the gate. Christian McCaffrey- Running Back- Stanford- McCaffrey could end up in the same position as Fournette and slip down in the draft with so few teams in the Top 10 looking for a running back. It may not matter where he ends up for Fantasy purposes, as he doesn't seem to be as popular as Cook and Fournette. McCaffrey is just as decorated as either of the running backs that may be drafted ahead of him, as he finished his career at Stanford with almost 4,000 yards and 31 touchdowns along with 99 receptions, proving he can hang in the passing game as well. NFL teams that pass on him (if they do) may regret it, and McCaffrey could produce for Fantasy owners right away depending on which team drafts him."]
["amp/sports/football", "Mike Williams- Wide Receiver- Clemson- Right now, Williams could be the first wide receiver off the draft board in late April, and he could be the biggest Fantasy contributor right away in his rookie season. He finished his Clemson career with 177 receptions for over 2,700 yards and 21 touchdowns. Listed at 6'3\" and 225 lbs., Williams could end up with the Bears drafting third and in need of a receiver after losing Alshon Jeffery to the Eagles in free agency. If that happens, it may be difficult for him to produce for Fantasy owners given the current quarterback situation in Chicago. If a team with a stable quarterback situation moves up to grab Williams, Fantasy owners should expect his value to be sky high from Week 1. Emma Watson's private photos stolen in hack, leaked online  Joe Mixon- Running Back- Oklahoma- With all the legal troubles Mixon seems to have, he may cost himself a shot at being a first round pick. He will eventually be drafted at some point, as his talent seems too good to pass up forever. During his final year as a Sooner, Mixon rushed for 1,274 yards with double-digit touchdowns, so any team that drafts him can easily solve their issues at running back right away. Again, not many teams with picks inside the Top 10 need a running back. Between the lack of need and his issues off the field, he may easily drop later in the draft, but he should make an immediate impact with his new team in 2017."]

Howard- Tight End- Alabama- The former Crimson Tide may very well be the first tight end drafted in late April, but he probably won't go in the Top 10, even though every team selecting in the Top 10 could use a tight end of his caliber. His senior year at Alabama saw him finish with 45 catches for 495 yards and three touchdowns. His new team could benefit greatly from a tight end that can make plays and cause mismatches for defenses.

He finished his college career at North Carolina with almost 5,000 passing yards and 41 touchdowns, including 30 in his Senior year. Without the talent to help him out in Cleveland, San Francisco or Chicago he will have a hard time gaining the trust of Fantasy owners in his rookie season."]
["amp/sports/football", "Emma Watson says the Beast character was 'hot' Dalvin Cook- Running Back- Florida- When the Jaguars pick at number four, Cook could be the first running back off the board since the Jaguars don't seem to have a back they can trust. In the three years Cook played at Florida, he amassed almost 5,000 yards on the ground and made 79 catches for almost 1,000 yards while scoring 48 total touchdowns. His presence would help Blake Bortles and the Jaguars' offense immensely, as Bortles would have a ground game to complement the passing attack. Cook would take the pressure off their pass-only offense and he would immediately win over Fantasy owners with his ability. Leonard Fournette- Running Back- LSU- Fournette finished his college career with almost 4,000 yards on the ground and 41 total touchdowns. The former LSU product could be selected over Cook and head to Jacksonville, where he too would make an immediate impact for Fantasy owners. If the Jaguars don't take Fournette with the fourth pick, he could slide down to ninth overall for Cincinnati, or another team may trade up to acquire him since none of the teams after the Jaguars really need a running back (Titans, Jets, Chargers, Panthers). Regardless of where Fournette ends up, Fantasy owners can be sure he will make a difference right out of the gate."]
["amp/sports/football", "Christian McCaffrey- Running Back- Stanford- McCaffrey could end up in the same position as Fournette and slip down in the draft with so few teams in the Top 10 looking for a running back. It may not matter where he ends up for Fantasy purposes, as he doesn't seem to be as popular as Cook and Fournette. McCaffrey is just as decorated as either of the running backs that may be drafted ahead of him, as he finished his career at Stanford with almost 4,000 yards and 31 touchdowns along with 99 receptions, proving he can hang in the passing game as well. NFL teams that pass on him (if they do) may regret it, and McCaffrey could produce for Fantasy owners right away depending on which team drafts him. Mike Williams- Wide Receiver- Clemson- Right now, Williams could be the first wide receiver off the draft board in late April, and he could be the biggest Fantasy contributor right away in his rookie season. He finished his Clemson career with 177 receptions for over 2,700 yards and 21 touchdowns. Listed at 6'3\" and 225 lbs., Williams could end up with the Bears drafting third and in need of a receiver after losing Alshon Jeffery to the Eagles in free agency. If that happens, it may be difficult for him to produce for Fantasy owners given the current quarterback situation in Chicago. If a team with a stable quarterback situation moves up to grab Williams, Fantasy owners should expect his value to be sky high from Week 1."]
["amp/sports/football", "Emma Watson's private photos stolen in hack, leaked online  Joe Mixon- Running Back- Oklahoma- With all the legal troubles Mixon seems to have, he may cost himself a shot at being a first round pick. He will eventually be drafted at some point, as his talent seems too good to pass up forever. During his final year as a Sooner, Mixon rushed for 1,274 yards with double-digit touchdowns, so any team that drafts him can easily solve their issues at running back right away. Again, not many teams with picks inside the Top 10 need a running back. Between the lack of need and his issues off the field, he may easily drop later in the draft, but he should make an immediate impact with his new team in 2017. O.J. Howard- Tight End- Alabama- The former Crimson Tide may very well be the first tight end drafted in late April, but he probably won't go in the Top 10, even though every team selecting in the Top 10 could use a tight end of his caliber. His senior year at Alabama saw him finish with 45 catches for 495 yards and three touchdowns. His new team could benefit greatly from a tight end that can make plays and cause mismatches for defenses. Fantasy owners should expect Howard to be a starter from Week 1 and to make an immediate impact even if it isn't Rob Gronkowski like."]

Russell Westbrook had 36 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Warriors 118-94 on Tuesday night to take a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference Finals. Golden State, which won a league record 73 games in the regular season, lost consecutive games for the first time this season. The Warriors must win Game 5 on Thursday in Oakland to keep their season alive. \"We all have to bounce back,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"The good news is, we go home. Obviously we play well at home. The idea now is to go home and get one win. Do that, and we put some pressure on them and we'll see what happens.\"  Isola: Warriors' 73 wins will need an asterisk if Thunder rolls  Klay Thompson led Golden State with 26 points, but two-time league MVP Stephen Curry was limited to 19 points on 6-for-20 shooting. Curry's shooting performance was so uncharacteristic that reporters asked if he was hurt. \"He's not injured,\" Kerr said. \"He's coming back from the knee, but he's not injured. He just had a lousy night. It happens, even to the best players in the world.\""]

Golden State's Draymond Green, who was fined for kicking Steven Adams in the groin in Game 3, finished with six points, 11 rebounds and six turnovers. Meanwhile, Oklahoma City got a boost from an unlikely source. Andre Roberson, a player the Warriors have ignored at times during the series, scored a career-high 17 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.  Thunder could make history by beating Warriors  Kevin Durant added 26 points and 11 rebounds and Serge Ibaka added 17 points and seven rebounds. As for Westbrook, it was his first triple-double of the playoffs after posting 18 in the regular season. It was his fifth career playoff triple-double. \"I play every game like it's my last, regardless of who's in front of me,\" he said. \"That's my job, and my job is to worry about my team, and that's all I do.\" The Thunder know they have to close. Nine teams have rallied from 3-1 deficits to win.  You're building an NBA team: Are you picking LeBron or Curry?  \"I think we're in a good place, but like I said, this game is over,\" Westbrook said. \"We've got to move on to the next game. Every game is different.\""]

Oklahoma City finished with a flurry and led 72-53 at halftime. The Thunder matched the most points they have scored in a first half in franchise playoff history, a mark they set the previous game against the Warriors.

["amp/sports/baseball/yankees", "Yankees lose Didi thanks to WBC, but playing it smart with Torres - NY Daily News TAMPA -- The Yankees won't have Didi Gregorius on Opening Day -- and you can blame the World Baseball Classic for that. In 2013, Mark Teixeira injured his wrist preparing for the WBC and was limited to 15 games as a result. And now, the event has cost the Yankees their 27-year-old shortstop for the start of the 2017 campaign. Gregorius suffered a\u00a0right shoulder strain while playing second base and trying to turn a double-play for the Netherlands during an exhibition game, and will miss approximately six weeks, according to Brian Cashman. The hope is that the Yankees get him back sometime in May. Gregorius underwent a dye-contrast MRI on Tuesday which confirmed the injury, and will be out of baseball activities for the next two weeks before beginning a light throwing program. \u201cThose are the concerns you have when players go to the WBC,\u201d Joe Girardi said. \u201cYou always worry about the injury thing.

It\u2019s not because of that.\u201d Gregorius played in 11 career games at second base -- all in 2014 with Arizona -- and would not have been playing there at Yankees spring training.\u00a0"]

And hopefully we\u2019ll deal with it as well.\u201d Gregorius is slated to make $5.1 million this season after he and the team avoided arbitration.

Didi Gregorius returning to Tampa after injuring shoulder at WBC He hit .276 with a career-high 20 homers for the Yankees last season. MLB teams may not prohibit players from participating in the WBC, which happens every four years. The Yankees now must deal with life without Didi. Many would like super prospect Gleyber Torres to take over the reins in his absence, but the Yankees are smartly going in a different direction. Torres was reassigned to minor-league camp following Tuesday night\u2019s 4-2 exhibition loss to the Red Sox. Torres, 20, has shined during the spring, hitting .464 with six doubles, a triple and two homers. But now isn't the time to rush him to the majors. It would be a panic move, thrusting him into the spotlight and all the perceived pressure that comes with playing in the Big Apple. Instead, the Yankees, who weren't considering Torres to make the roster even before Didi's injury, are taking a smarter, more pragmatic approach."]
["amp/sports/baseball/yankees", "Yankees pitchers continue to do little to quell rotation concerns \"I think we have to make some important decisions, and one of them is not to overreact to Didi's injury at the expense of Gleyber,\" Cashman said. \"Gleyber's time is coming at some point, and whenever that's going to be is going to be.

Pressure has been mounting on host Chris Rock to drop out in protest, though Sharpton stopped short of endorsing that scenario. There is a school of thought that a global telecast is the perfect platform for Rock to address the issue. It's been a particular embarrassment to Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, herself a vocal proponent of diversifying the industry.  \"Selma\" star David Oyelowo, himself a notorious snub a year ago when the Academy ignored his turn as Martin Luther King in the biopic, slammed the industry at a gala honoring Isaacs Monday night.

Actor Idris Elba, whose critically acclaimed supporting turn in \"Beasts of No Nation\" was among the most glaring Oscar omissions this year, addressed the subject in front of British Members of Parliament on Monday. \"We need to counter what everybody has, see the lay of the land and see who has which careers in TV,\" Elba told the inquiry into the country's entertainment industry. \"Who makes TV, and who is allowed on TV and when they get the opportunity which roles do they play, on and off screen.\" Rapper 50 Cent announced his hopes Tuesday that Rock would cancel his plans to host. \"Chris please do not do the oscars awards.

He did not return after an hour and 25 minute rain delay, and the bullpen could not hold off the Nationals as the Mets fell 5-0 at Nationals Park. The Mets (40-36) lost their second straight to the Nats (46-32) and fell five games behind them in the National League East. The Mets were never more than 4.5 game behind the Nationals in 2015.

The state Department of Financial Services says it has received complaints from transgender people who say they were denied coverage in certain circumstance. Lisette Johnson, who heads up the Department of Financial Service's health bureau, sent a letter to insurers providing guidance on how to handle coverage for health services provided to transgender individuals. \"Transgender persons should not be discriminated against because of their transgender status nor denied coverage for treatment because of coding issues,\" Johnson wrote. Problems cited in the letter are a female who identifies as a male being denied a claim for cervical cytology screening because the insurer has the person down as a male. Or conversely, a male identifying as a female being denied a claim for prostate cancer screening because the insurance company has listed a female. Insurers receiving a claim from someone who is transgender \"should take reasonable steps, including requesting additional information, to determine whether the insured is eligible for the services prior to denying the claim,\" the state letter says. In announcing the rule, Gov. Cuomo said that \"in New York, we believe that health care is a right, and we are committed to protecting that right for all New Yorkers, regardless of income, age, race, sexuality or gender identity.\""]

It was the story of a tremendous champion, of a challenger with a monumental heart, and of a fight manager with compassion that belies the cigar-chewing Hollywood stereotype. The manager, Eddie Futch, refused to allow his gutty challenger, Joe Frazier, to come out for the 15th and final round. Thus does Muhammad Ali, the champion of our generation, retain his heavyweight title. He will fight again. For Joe Frazier, former champ, it is doubtful.  Eddie Futch's role in the Thrilla in Manila fight in 1975  Ali gave one of those maybe-I\u2019ll-retire teasers afterward, but most observers, including me, don\u2019t take him too seriously. The money is too big, waiting there for him to scoop up. He likes it. He likes the buildings it buys. He is queer for buildings and real estate right now.

Shelter census numbers were topping 60,000 before he began rethinking his approach. \"Obviously I'm not happy with where we stand on homelessness,\" he said, admitting that it was late in the game when he decided to broaden outreach to street homeless and shift away from the use of \"cluster site\" apartments and commercial hotels."]

He now faces a history of neighborhood opposition to new shelters as he moves his plan forward. He admitted that fixing this problem is one of his most daunting challenges. \"To end homelessness in New York City, I don't know how and when that happens and I look certainly around the country I think this has happened tragically in a lot of cities,\" he said. \"On homelessness, I think we're talking about a long war and people should be honest about that.\" The mayor\u2019s plan includes a promise that all communities targeted for new shelters will get a 30-day notice, but since then he's given only 24-hour notice before placing homeless individuals in neighborhood hotels.

Stenson only cared about that silver claret jug. He wound up with so much more Sunday. His final stroke of this major masterpiece was a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole at Royal Troon that tumbled into the cup on the last turn. His 10th birdie of the round gave him an 8-under 63 to match Johnny Miller for the lowest closing round by a major champion.

Stenson three-putted for bogey from just off the first green, and he three-putted on No. 10 to fall back into a tie for the lead. They matched pars on only six of the 18 holes.

["sports/baseball/yankees", "Get ready for bidding war if Yankees, Astros remain AL contenders - NY Daily News The Astros show up in the Bronx on Thursday night as the team to beat in the American League. OK, they were my preseason pick to win the World Series this year, so I\u2019m biased, and who knew you\u2019d be able to make an argument for the Yankees here in early May, but it\u2019s hard to argue against the \u2019Stros, really, considering how loaded they are with young, position-player talent. Put it this way: with the likes of Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa, and Alex Bregman, they\u2019re maybe a year or two ahead of the Yankees in developing home-grown stars, and perhaps right on schedule to follow the lead of the Cubs and turn that young talent into a championship. Of course, with the Yanks threatening to crash the party ahead of schedule, the \u2019Stros also loom as another measuring stick for the home team. Though after going 5-0 in Fenway Park and Wrigley Field the last couple of weeks, Aaron Judge and friends are fast proving to be more than an April fluke. It should make for an entertaining weekend at the Stadium, especially with Dallas Keuchel taking the ball in the series opener against Michael Pineda. Unfortunately for the Yankees, Keuchel was up to his old tricks against the Bombers on Thursday"]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "Back to his Cy Young Award form of 2015 so far this season, at 6-0 with a 1.69 ERA in eight starts after Thursday\u2019s 3-2 Astros win, Keuchel has been murder on the Yankees during his career. In seven starts against them he is 5-2 with a 1.41 ERA, including the six shutout innings in the Astros\u2019 wild-card win at the Stadium two seasons ago. The Yanks have the dynamic offense that is leading the AL in runs scored and home runs, but the Astros right now look like the surer bet to win their division, at least partly because of a lack of competition. In fact, with the disappointing Rangers in the cellar, the AL West just might be the weakest division in the majors. But here\u2019s what adds intrigue, should it turn out the Yankees are primed for a bigger season than even their front office saw coming: both of these teams are going to need to add a top starting pitcher to be serious about making a deep run in October, which means they could be bidding against one another come trade season. In fact, it seemed a foregone conclusion throughout the offseason that the Astros would make a trade for a starter, specifically White Sox lefty Jose Quintana. Industry sources say the \u2019Stros wanted Quintana, but GM Jeff Luhnow thought the price was too high and wouldn\u2019t give up his best prospects."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "It could very well still happen. As a major league scout said Wednesday, \u201cright now the best bet in baseball is that Houston is going to make a trade to upgrade their starting rotation. \u201cEven with Keuchel pitching like a No. 1 again, they\u2019re a starter short, if you\u2019re talking about winning a title. With all of the talent they have \u2014 and they have prospects to trade \u2014 it would be a sin not to go get a guy at the deadline.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s true, the \u2019Stros seem to have all the makings of a championship team. In addition to their young stars, they added some needed veteran presence in trading with the Yankees for Brian McCann behind plate, where he platoons with power-hitting Evan Gattis, and signed Carlos Beltran as a free agent. Their bullpen is strong as well, as their trade with the Phillies for closer Ken Giles is paying dividends a year later. So far their rotation has been solid behind Keuchel, but even if Lance McCullers is blossoming as they hoped, another proven starter could be crucial for them come October. If it\u2019s not Quintana, well, new trade candidates are already emerging, with a handful of teams already looking at the possibility of lost seasons. The Blue Jays could be looking to move Marco Estrada or J.A. Happ. The Giants might like to trade Johnny Cueto, who has an opt-out on his contract for after this season."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "With free agency looming for Yu Darvish, the Rangers could dangle the Japanese star at the deadline. And as I wrote last week about an idea that applied to the Yankees, if the Pirates decide it\u2019s time to rebuild, they very well could look to trade Gerrit Cole. How far Yankees GM Brian Cashman is willing to go to make such a trade, if the Yankees keep hitting and winning, should be fascinating. He\u2019s got plenty of prospects, but wanted more time to evaluate them and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have reason to give them up as soon as this summer. Nevertheless, fellow executives don\u2019t see him sitting on prospects if the Yankees have an opportunity to win the AL East, unexpected or not. \u201cCash will make a move if it\u2019s warranted,\u201d a rival exec said Wednesday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see him doing what the Cubs did last year, giving up a kid like (Gleyber) Torres for a rental (Aroldis Chapman). \u201cHe\u2019s probably not trading Torres for anybody, but I think he\u2019d give up some other top pieces for the right pitcher who\u2019d be under (contractual) control for a couple of years.\u201d Most likely that would mean Quintana, who has a reasonable contract with option years through 2020, or Cole, who is a free agent after the 2019 season. So as appetizing as this early-season matchup is between the Astros and Yankees, it might prove to be more of an appetizer for any battle they may do on the trade market come July. \u00a0"]

Despite the repeated failures, the North\u2019s determination in testing the Musudan worries Washington and its allies, Tokyo and Seoul, because the missile\u2019s potential 3,500-kilometer (2,180-mile) range could target much of Asia and the Pacific, including U.S. military bases there. Each new test \u2014 apparently linked to a command from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u2014 also likely provides valuable insights to the North\u2019s scientists and military officials as they push toward their goal of a nuclear and missile program that can threaten the U.S. mainland. Pyongyang earlier this year conducted a nuclear test and launched a long-range rocket that outsiders say was a cover for a test of banned missile technology. A statement from South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said a suspected first Musudan launch from the east coast city of Wonsan failed early Wednesday morning but gave few other details. Later Wednesday, the JCS said the North fired another suspected Musudan, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if it succeeded.  North Korean state media endorses Donald Trump "]

Another American official said the first launch was a suspected Musudan but initial indications were that it failed in flight over the Sea of Japan, which the Koreas call the East Sea. The United States had no immediate details on the reported second launch. In April, North Korea attempted unsuccessfully to launch three suspected Musudan missiles, but all exploded in midair or crashed, according to South Korean defense officials. Earlier this month, North Korea had another suspected Musudan failure, South Korean officials said. Before April\u2019s launches, North Korea had never flight-tested a Musudan missile, although one was displayed during a military parade in 2010 in Pyongyang, its capital.  N. Korea blasts 'nuclear war lunatic' Obama's Hiroshima visit  The launches appear to stem from Kim Jong Un\u2019s order in March for more nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The order was an apparent response to springtime U.S.-South Korean military drills, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal. Since the end of those military drills, Pyongyang has repeatedly called for the resumption of talks with rival Seoul, even as it pursues new missile development, but the South has rejected the overtures. It wants the North to first take steps toward nuclear disarmament. Pyongyang says its rivals must negotiate with it as an established nuclear power, something Washington and Seoul refuse to do."]

The North was slapped with the strongest U.N. sanctions in two decades after it conducted a fourth nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch earlier this year. Earlier Tuesday, at a Washington briefing, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said that if North Korea were to conduct another missile test, it would violate UN resolutions and \u201cbe another provocative action.

Though Peeps are sold year-round, the company starts preparing nine months in advance for the Easter holiday and starts stocking up for the heavy demand. \"It's an iconic candy and has been a tradition for Easter,\" Mark Wright, the Director of Operations Business Management, told the New York Daily News."]
["amp/news", "Ever wonder what it's like to work in a candy factory? \"It's sweet,\" a 17-year Peeps employee named Kathy told the New York Daily News. \"I work with marshmallows.\" Wright agrees, saying, \"If you can't have fun making candy, where could you have fun?\" Peeps aren't only just for eating, either. Peeps dioramas are becoming more and more popular, and there are countless contest opportunities. One recent diorama had 117 Peeps chicks dressed as cardinals convening at the papal conclave ... or should we say Peepal conclave! Here, colorful sugar is prepared to be used on the conveyor belt. Everyone loves Peeps! The company produces about 2 billion Peeps a year and has plenty of celebrity fans, including Justin Bieber, Oprah Winfrey, Charlize Theron, Teri Hatcher and Diane Sawyer. \"Peeps have a cult like following,\" Wright said. Children and adults alike have now been enjoying the iconic candy for 60 years. While walking through the factory, the intense smell and  taste of sugar permeates throughout. Inside the same building, Just Born also produces Hot Tamales and Mike and Ike candies. The Peeps factory is a well-oiled machine at this point. The entire process for creating the marshmallow candies from start to finish takes only 6 minutes -- and that includes going from extruder to packaging."]

They got this far with huge expectations under first-year President of Baseball Operations, Andrew Friedman, and new general manager Farhan Zaidi \u2014 and with a whopping regular-season payroll of $285 million. It took a few days longer than expected to secure their latest playoff berth after a surprising sweep by last-place Colorado at Coors Field over the weekend and a 12-inning loss Monday night. But, the way it worked out, the Dodgers got to celebrate on the home field of their rival at sold-out AT&T Park. \u201cThey\u2019ve won three out of the last five,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to earn it.\u201d The only other time in the ballpark\u2019s 16-year history that a visiting team clinched a playoff berth or series here was the Dodgers when they captured the NL wild card on the second-to-last day in 2006."]

Burks, 29, worked in the same prison tailor shop where Sweat and Matt received some of the tools they used in their escape.

Mohammed Ibrahim, a university student from the town of Bir al-Abe, said militants had urged residents there to abandon Sufism before the unprecedented attack on Friday. The militants also distributed leaflets several times ordering villagers not to collaborate with government security forces, he told The Associated Press. Mohammed Darwish, 30, who also lives in the town, said militants raided the residence of village tribal leader Sheikh Hussein al-Jerirr twice this year. \u201cThey threatened him not to hold Sufi gatherings, and last week, they came on motorbikes and asked residents not to participate in Sufi rituals,\u201d Darwish told the AP. Members of the Islamic State affiliate in Sinai believe Sufis are heretics who should be killed and publicly identified the Al-Rawdah mosque, which also serves as a Sufi center, as a target months ago, according to Ahmed Saqr, an expert on the Sinai insurgency. The barbaric attack on the mosque-which included a grenade tossed into the house of worship-was one of the worst in decades. The terrorists \u2014 who carried a black banner like those carried by ISIS \u2014 shot people inside the mosque point-blank in the heads, according to witnesses. They took up positions at the door and the window before the assault began. The dead included 27 children, authorities said."]

But the majority of the police force and army members assigned to the area have little to no counter terrorism training.

Warner was originally scheduled to appear Monday.

Derrick (Wind) Ward - one third of the \"Earth, Wind and Fire\" rushing attack - found the windfall he was looking for when he signed a four-year, $17 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He will also be out of Brandon (Earth) Jacobs' considerable shadow and have a chance to compete for the Bucs' starting job with Earnest Graham, who missed the final six games last season with an ankle injury. Tampa Bay released RB Warrick Dunn on Wednesday.  The departure wasn't unexpected since Ward, who will be 29 in August, made it clear he planned to strike it rich in free agency and wanted a chance to start - two things that weren't going to happen if he stayed in New York.  The Giants were obviously committed to Jacobs, who recently signed to a four-year, $25 million contract. A team source said they were anxious to elevate Ahmad (Fire) Bradshaw to the No. 2 role.  Still, it could be a big loss for the Giants considering Ward rushed for 1,025 yards last season, making him and Jacobs just the fifth set of teammates to each rush for 1,000 yards in the same NFL campaign. And though Ward mostly played a secondary role, he did have a memorable, 215-yard day on Dec. 21 in an overtime win over the Carolina Panthers that helped the Giants clinch the top seed in the NFC.

["entertainment/movies", "In a widely shared posting on her Facebook page, Gadot had praised Israel's military during the Gaza-Israel 2014 war, sending prayers to Israeli soldiers \"who are risking their lives protecting my country against the horrific acts conducted by Hamas.\" Officials at the Lebanese economy ministry were not immediately available for comment. The security official said banning a movie would be something that would ultimately come from the country's interior minister, following a recommendation from the six-member committee. Even though Lebanon enjoys a greater margin of freedom of expression than other countries in the region, prior censorship remains in place, particularly with content relating to Israel, religion and homosexuality.  Summer Movie Preview: 'Wonder Woman,' 'Dunkirk' set to thrill  Reflecting tightening of censorship, an Egyptian movie about a celebrity Muslim cleric, Mawlana, and a Lebanese movie, Beach House, about friends discussing their identities were banned in Lebanon earlier this year. Mawlana was later shown after cuts were made, said one cinema manager, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing controversy. The two movies were approved in Egypt. There is no clear mechanism for appeal of a ban on art work and public campaigns often are the only means to protest a ban. Religious institutions also have a say in art work with religious references. Despite the controversy in Lebanon, Wonder Woman is set to open as scheduled during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan across theaters in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait on Thursday. It is scheduled for release June 22 in Oman and June 29 in Bahrain."]

["new-york", "Graveyard-shift subway repair crews will start earlier, MTA says Riders beware: The graveyard shift for subway repair crews will be starting earlier than usual from now on, the Daily News has learned. Crews that repair tracks, signals and electrical equipment and sweep up trash will have to start their work orders at 10 p.m. as of Monday, instead of midnight. It's an effort by MTA management to get as much work done before the morning rush hour begins at 5 a.m. As a result, midnight work orders will be rare. \"The relatively low productivity that the MTA has historically gotten out of general orders and diversions has been an intractable problem here,\" MTA president Pat Foye told The News. Precious time gets squandered while transit workers wait around to actually begin the night's work, as power is turned off, equipment and supplies are readied and safety flaggers are put in place. But even though Foye vows to give late-night travelers plenty of alternatives and warnings, straphangers are annoyed. \"It's definitely a bother,\" said Malik Cummings, 25, who works at an Oakley sunglasses store in Midtown. \"It's not like I can leave work earlier.\" Cummings said he gets out around 9 p.m. and has to trek to Far Rockaway in Queens on the A train. He was dismissive about the benefits of the earlier start time. \"There's always 'repair work,' \" he said. David Perry, a fashion designer, said steady service is crucial for him, whether he's going for a late-night jog or heading to a party."]
["new-york", "\"It's key to being a youthful 25-year-old New Yorker,\" Perry, a Chinatown resident, said. MTA management got the directive Wednesday from David Knights, NYC Transit's chief track officer. \"There will be logistical challenges at times, however, we need to make it happen,\" Knights wrote. Knights wrote that getting work orders started earlier \"will be closely monitored.\" That's going to be possible because the MTA has added 10 employees at the Rail Control Center. The work order process, \"it's fair to say, has been undermanaged in the past,\" Foye said."]

Last week, Chance, a Chicago native and musical artist, donated $1 million to Chicago Public Schools in response to Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoing a funding bill that would have afforded the school system an addition $215 million. Rose grew up in the Englewood area of Chicago's notorious South Side. He attended public schools in the city, including Simeon Career Academy, where the Knicks point guard played his high school hoops. Rose knows firsthand the trials facing Chicago's youth, and he commends Chance for his efforts and willingness to speak out. \"It's always great to hear, especially with someone that's in his position, coming from Chicago and knowing what's going on internally and (being someone) that's willing to do something about it,\" Rose told the Daily News on Sunday evening before the Knicks took on the Nets in Brooklyn. \"It's always great to hear when somebody steps up and takes the challenge.\"  Chance the Rapper blesses Chicago Public Schools with $1M promise  Rose only met Chance on one occasion, and the two didn't have time to talk at length. But Rose admires the 23-year-old hip-hop artist from afar. Chance is from the West Chatham neighborhood on the South Side. \"I love everything that he's doing and the way that he's doing it,\" Rose said. But the former Chicago Bull knows Chance can't change the culture on his own."]
["sports/basketball/knicks", "\"It's a great start. But he's only one person. He only can do so much,\" Rose said. \"As far as the CPS, it's a lot that needs to change. For one, financially, that's one part of it. But\u2026it's a lack of passion there when it comes to the CPS that everyone needs to be aware of.\"  Charles Oakley to sit courtside at Knicks-Nets with Ice Cube  Chance announced his donation in a news conference Tuesday, blasting Rauner for what he believes is apathy toward Chicago's disadvantaged children. Chance met with Rauner last Friday, but was unhappy with the \"vague answers\" he received. As a result, he pledged the $1 million to support the arts and after-school programming in CPS. \"Governor Rauner can use his executive power to give Chicago's children the resources they need to fulfill their God-given right to learn,\" Chance said Tuesday. \"Our talks were unsuccessful. Gov. Rauner still won't commit to giving Chicago's kids a chance without caveats or ultimatums. \u2026While I'm frustrated and disappointed in the governor's inaction, that will not stop me from continuing to do all I can to support Chicago's most valuable resource: its children.\" Rose, who told the News he donated to Chicago's Maggie Daley Park program two years ago while still a member of the Bulls, believes it's crucial for public figures from Chicago to be vocal and active - just like he and Chance have been."]
["sports/basketball/knicks", "\"It's huge,\" Rose said. \"We're bringing awareness to it. That's something that gets overlooked. You look at the school system being shut down in Chicago, the amount of schools that's being overlooked. And I think it's because it's public schools. Kids are having to bus from different neighborhoods to other schools. And you talk about gangs, that's another thing in Chicago where it's a problem. It's a problem. And when them kids get bussed, they have nobody to protect them at the school or before school. And that's something that they have to deal with. \"If they were to go and change the inside of the CPS, I think it would help a lot of kids. And that's what I mean by being passionate about it. At least act like they care about it. I think a lot can change.\" Rose has ideas about where that change can begin. \"It starts with making the teachers feel like they're wanted. I think it starts with the teachers,\" he said. \"Not saying the teachers are bad, but make them feel excited about teaching the kids. It starts with them, and it's always the top and it goes all the way down.\""]
["sports/basketball/knicks", "\"The kids have to feel loved, and that's something that everybody has to take into consideration. The kids, even if they're not getting that love at home, they need it at least somewhere,\" Rose continued. \"It plays a part. Living there, being there and being in those type of circumstances, having to live in them type of environments, kids rarely hear 'You did a great job' or hear anything that's satisfying. They don't get no type of love there. And I'm not saying the school has to do it or the teacher has to do it. But you have to go far beyond when in you're in them type of positions.\""]

Why?\" Sharpton asked as he addressed a cheering crowd during his weekly rally at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem. \"The reason you won't is because they're protesting the criminal justice inequities in this country,\" a fired up Sharpton said to roaring applause. \"He's talking about 'fire' like he's still doing 'The Apprentice,'\" he added.

Quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the trend last year while playing for the San Francisco 49ers. \"That's a total disrespect of our heritage.

The FBI had launched an investigation into allegations that Kenner and Constantine had stolen millions of dollars from NHL stars who had invested in their real estate projects and other ventures, including a prepaid credit card company called Eufora. The investors were asking questions about where their money had gone. Banks were preparing to foreclose on loans; rivals were allegedly plotting to take over Eufora. Prosecutor Jim Miskiewicz, wrapping up his cross examination of Kenner at the alleged con men\u2019s trial on fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges, played a recording of the desperate Home Depot conversation Tuesday for the jury at the Alfonse M.

Kenner, a former financial adviser who surreptitiously recorded the conversation on his cell phone, says little during it.

Miskiewicz, however, ripped several big holes in Kenner\u2019s testimony during Tuesday\u2019s cross-examination. The prosecutor, for example, asked why Kenner never mentioned Jowdy or the millions he refused to pay back in a July 2006 \u201cstate of the union\u201d letter he distributed to investors in a Hawaii real estate deal, several months after Jowdy supposedly refused to pay the players their money. \u201cIs there an email from Jowdy saying he won\u2019t pay you back?\u201d Miskieiwicz asked Kenner, whose business transactions were documented in millions of pages of bank records, emails and other papers.

Cops from the 46th Precinct stationhouse on Ryer Ave. were responding to a call from an E. 183rd St. Bronx apartment building on Feb. 13 when Officer Ruben Cuesta fired a single shot into the pit bull\u2019s skull as the dog scampered about in the hallway. Video of the shooting showed the wounded dog named Spike still wagging his tail before he died. NYPD COP KILLS BRONX FAMILY'S BELOVED DOG (GRAPHIC VIDEO)"]

Palladino, an animal lover who helps rescue and find new homes for dogs, said the NYPD should be trained in canine body language to figure out whether a dog is being threatening. \u201cI want the officers to be more educated in dog body language, pit bulls especially,\u201d Palladino said. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Cuesta, 28, would have to \u201cjustify what was going through his mind at that particular time.\u201d A surveillance video the Daily News acquired shows Cuesta backing away from Spike, then shooting the dog from a few feet away as he slowly approached, wagging his tail."]

We finally heard this proclamation on Thursday from, of all people, Secretary of Defense-designate James Mattis at his confirmation hearing. When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) asked him whether gay and lesbian troops could continue to serve openly in a Trump administration, Mattis offered 16 words that are as vital a national motto as \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d: \"Frankly,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cI've never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with.\"  Caitlyn Jenner to attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration  Gillibrand was seeking only a mundane answer: There are no atheists in foxholes, after all, so obviously there shouldn\u2019t be any homophobes, either, right? But Mattis\u2019s answer moved beyond bureaucratic nuts and bolts into a realm where too few American politicians, and almost no Republican politicians, ever go \u2014 namely, people should sleep with anyone they want and no one should make them feel bad about it. You may argue that the decade-long debate \u2014 and ultimate triumph of \u2014 gay marriage suggests that politicians have long ago set aside their bias against free love. But as the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in 2015 revealed, the debate about same-sex unions was not about copulation but about capitulation; if the government was going to set up the legal framework of marriage, it couldn\u2019t rightly deny some citizens access its protections.

["news/politics", "But even during the debate, few politicians had the guts to champion the \u201csex\u201d part of \u201csame-sex\u201d marriage, as Mattis did on Thursday.

Which is why Mattis\u2019 wording was so f---ing refreshing \u2014 emphasis on f---ing. Sexual expression is as basic a freedom as speech \u2014 especially in a nation with a constitution that forbids religious leaders from imposing their 16th-century inhibitions on the rest of us.

(Fortunately, Mattis isn\u2019t the only outlier in the Trump cabinet: Burger magnate Andy Pudzer\u2019s famously lascivious Carl\u2019s Jr. ads very openly call for sex between ravenous women in bikinis and a hamburger, which hopefully will open the door to the love that truly dare not speak its name!)"]

With a single sentence \u2014 \"the debt is not payable\" \u2014 Puerto Rico's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, acknowledged to The New York Times what Wall Street has long known: the island's government and publicly owned utilities cannot hope to ever pay off a staggering $72 billion debt, which amounts to nearly 100% of the island's total annual economic output. (By contrast, the average U.S. state borrows less than 10% of its economic output.) Puerto Rico's public electric company owes $9 billion in debt, and is expected to miss a payment due this week.

Default doesn't appear to be an option: Under U.S. law, cities can declare bankruptcy but states can't.

At first, people thought there was a recession, but it was not,\" the report says. \"It has been two decades of stagnation with falling population and no measurable increase in real per capita incomes.\" Massive layoffs and cutbacks in government services are all but inevitable, and will add to an already high 14% unemployment rate.

While the fiscal math is indeed bleak, the reality is that the roots of Puerto Rico's crisis are almost entirely political. It was a special tax program, Section 936, that encouraged big U.S. firms to operate in Puerto Rico \u2014 and the closing of that program in 1996 that triggered a flight of corporations and jobs from the island. It was the North American Free Trade Agreement that effectively eliminated one of Puerto Rico's big economic advantages as a Latin American player with free and easy access to markets on the U.S. mainland. And it was the shocking irresponsibility of one island administration after another \u2014 some aligned with mainland Republicans, others with Democrats \u2014 that led to years of overspending and deficits being covered up with new borrowing.

["entertainment/tv", "John Oliver buys and forgives $15M in medical debt - NY Daily News This week, comedian John Oliver tackled the issue of debt collection in a typically biting-yet-hilarious segment that ended with an atypical $15 million gift. The \"Last Week Tonight\" host started by outlining the scope of the problem. American households, it turns out, have more than $12 trillion in debt collectively \u2014 and $436 billion of it is more than 90 days overdue. \"And it is not good when anything is that late,\" Oliver observed. \"If your baby is three months overdue, you'd effectively just be giving birth to a floppy toddler.\" Delinquent debts have birthed an entire industry of companies that purchase unpaid debt at pennies on the dollar.  John Oliver uses \u2018Hamilton\u2019 creator to explain Puerto Rico's debt  In some cases, that process of selling and buying and reselling debt can lead to an insanely named phenomenon called \"zombie debt.\" \"The comparison is actually quite apt because just like on 'The Walking Dead,' zombie debt comes back from the grave, is incredibly hard to deal with and seems to disproportionately impact minorities,\" Oliver joked. Sometimes, those zombie debt collectors can serve up some insane threats in an effort to get their money \u2014 as Oliver demonstrated by playing mind-blowing debt collector phone messages in which callers threated to do everything from kill the debtors to arrest and kill their dogs. \"That is not just horrifying, it's stupid,\" Oliver quipped. \"How are you gonna put handcuffs on a dog?\""]
["entertainment/tv", " SEE IT: John Oliver offers a 17-year news catch-up for cicadas  In some cases, debt buyers have fairly unscrupulous practices, which is why Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said that the agency had received more complaints about the debt collection industry than any other, according to a clip Oliver played for viewers. It's also a loosely regulated industry in many states, Oliver explained as he pulled up a map of the many states that don't require any licensing to purchase debt \u2014 and then one of many states that don't require any licensing to collect debt. \"Essentially, that means that in some places in this country you need to fill out less paperwork to start collecting money from people's pockets than you do to collect fish from a f---ing lake,\" the comic noted. To demonstrate, Oliver purchased some debt himself.  John Oliver calls Trump 'Rome burning in man form'  A couple months ago, he explained, the show incorporated a company in Mississippi \u2014 and used it to buy $15 million in out-of-statute medical debt from more than 9,000 people.

["amp/sports/football/jets", "Some context: Last week multiple articles that included interviews with Smith were written about the one-year anniversary of the infamous punch by IK Enemkpali that broke the quarterback\u2019s jaw and cost him his starting job. Then, after Thursday\u2019s preseason game against the Jaguars, Smith declined to speak with reporters, violating the league\u2019s media policy. He then refused media requests on Saturday and then again on Sunday, when he sent the tweet. Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. \"Like\" us here. So it\u2019s possible that Smith was annoyed at Enemkpali\u2019s punch resurfacing in the news \u2014 though he granted interviews on the subject. Or maybe he\u2019s upset about having to speak with the media after the game, though NFL media demands are generally light relative to other major sports. Or perhaps he\u2019s anticipating being asked about getting booed by a home crowd again at MetLife Stadium on Thursday. Smith played decently in the preseason win over the Jaguars, though it started a little rough. A near-pick earned him those boos, though he responded with a nice touchdown pass to Charone Peake. The QB completed 8 of 14 passes for 79 yards and a touchdown in the game. Of course, his tweet on Sunday actually created a story where there would have been none. He followed up the tweet with another that read, \u201cI\u2019m Focused Man!!\u201d The entire ordeal is an interesting tact for someone who has openly admitted that he\u2019s auditioning for every team in the league this year."]

Specifically, to Galatians 6:7, the popular verse translated as some variation on \"As ye sow, so shall ye reap.\" Jax sowed death, including the death of his mother Gemma, whom he executed in the rose garden last week. FIVE STAR REVIEW: Cycle of violence comes to satisfying end in 'Sons of Anarchy' finale He did that because Gemma had killed his wife Tara last year, and Jax's code required that he avenge that death, even if it meant popping a slug into Mommy's back. Nero had warned him that killing Mom is something from which you probably don't recover, and there was no sign Tuesday that Jax had any hope he would. \"I did what I know how to do,\" he explained to Nero. \"I can't change.\" The problem, he explained later, was that even before he was born, Gemma was planning to immerse him in this life. He had no options. \"I tried to change,\" he said. \"I couldn't.\" Yeah, the old \"Blame Mommy\" gambit. Except sometimes, of course, Mommy really is to blame. Jax spent his last day making the rounds. He cleaned up some rivalries, settled a couple of scores, visited Opie's and Tara's graves. He left Opie his club rings, Tara his wedding ring."]
["entertainment/tv", "He went to D.A. Patterson's office to declare that he would tell her everything - a scene that paid amusing homage to the finale of Kurt Sutter's earlier show \"The Shield,\" where crooked cop Vic Mackey agreed to tell \"everything\" and cracked that he hoped his interrogators had plenty of tape for the recorder. Related: 'Sons of Anarchy' creator Kurt Sutter opens up on the decisions behind the finale Jax didn't spill that much. He told the D.A. who killed Tara and then directed her to the farmhouse where she'd find Gemma and Wayne. He didn't mention they were dead. He probably didn't have to. Jax also pulled Chibs aside to tell him he'd have to take over, and why. Later he enjoyed a last round of man-hugs with the rest of the club. His last stop was the roadside site where his father, J.T. Teller, died by running his bike into a truck 20 years earlier. He told J.T. he now understood why J.T. wanted out, because he now knew how hard it is \"to get right with both family and patch. . . . A good outlaw and a good father can't sit inside the same man.\" All Jax could do now was try to prevent the same cancer from engulfing his own sons, Abel and Thomas. \"It's too late for me,\" he said, and if that sounds melodramatic, okay, it was - though no more melodramatic than when he told Nero that getting out is \"what I should have done while my wife was alive.\""]
["entertainment/tv", "Hey, when Kurt Sutter has written a series like this for seven years, he earns the right to a few lines like that. Related: Jimmy Smits talks about tense finale experience for cast In any case, Jax said, \"It's not too late for my boys. I don't want them to become what I have become. I promise they will never know this life of chaos.\"\u00a0 Toward that end, he asked Nero to sell his property and give the proceeds to Wendy so she could take the boys to Nero's ranch in Norco or to her family back East or \"anywhere except Charming.\" Jax being dead now and all, it's too late to tell him it may not be that simple. As Nero and Wendy were driving to Norco, we saw Abel absent-mindedly playing with Daddy's \"Sons\" ring, the one Abel wears on his hand. Let's make a wild guess the inclusion of that moment wasn't random and meaningless. Also, Abel has already shown signs of serious violent psychosis, which doesn't bode well for a clean break from his father's DNA. Check back with Charming in 20 years and let's see if Abel has the patch. Jax also thought he had cleaned up all those little gang quarrels Tuesday. He shot Marks, which cleared the way for Tyler, and he shot several IRA thugs, which meant Conor could now supply guns to the Mayans. The idea that all the gangs in California will be gathering soon to record \"We Are the World\" may be a little optimistic, given the volatile nature of outlaw gang dynamics."]
["entertainment/tv", "But Jax did his best and anyhow, it's not his problem anymore. It's Chibs's problem. Chibs becoming MC president completed a sort of de facto exchange for him, since he had just lost his sheriff girlfriend, Althea, which to be honest didn't seem to break him up too much. After Althea told him that from now on she was just a law enforcement officer and he was just an outlaw, he mentioned how that particular relationship has not always ended well for law enforcement officers in Charming. \"Are you threatening me?\" she asked. \"I don't have to,\" he replied. \"History doesn't lie.\" Not everybody lost in love. Tig got a final chance to rest his head in Venus's lap, capping off a day in which he also became the chapter's new vice president. You go, Tig. The club also welcomed its first black member, T.O., making it the most inclusive MC around. All of this happened while the night was unfolding at a remarkably deliberate pace. It was a long episode, about an hour and 48 minutes, but that wasn't what made it feel deliberate. In contrast to episodes this season where everyone seemed to be moving in double time - probably to avoid getting shot - Tuesday's pace was measured. It was also wistful and nostalgic, like a waltz where all the notes have been plotted and will be played. The tone was set in the opening sequence, the one between \"Previously ... \" and the theme song."]
["entertainment/tv", "It ran 5-6 minutes, during which Jax dug through old family photos, those journals he used to write all the time, and his father's memoir/club history. Jax looked at all of them, smiled, and threw them into a fire. He didn't saw a word for the whole sequence. All we heard was Bruce Springsteen singing \"Adam Raised a Cain.\" It was hard to miss the point, and not particularly hard to figure where all this was going. The opening also made it clear that in a lot of ways Tuesday was going to be a one-man show. However much we care about the other characters, Jax has been the beating heart of the show, so the \"Sons\" arc was going to end where he took it. For the final scene, Jax rode off on his bike down I-580, cigarette in his mouth, no helmet, two dozen police trailing behind him. He was smiling and looking serene - sort of like Matthew Crawley before his fatal crash in season 3 of \"Downton Abbey,\" a comparison that may mark the first time \"Sons\" and \"Downton\" have ever shared a sentence. The more obvious symbolism, though, was internal to \"Sons.\" Beyond Jax choosing to wrap things up on the same stretch of road as his father, we saw a black bird soar overhead, even if it didn't fly straight in a perfect line. Two crows pecked by the side of the road."]

It went sideways, half the day. I saw it then. When he beat me in \u201908 (at the U.S. Open), it was going really crooked. I\u2019m talking off the planet sideways. It progressively got worse and then his body went bye-bye and here we are.\u201d"]
["amp/sports/more-sports", "Mediate, 53, has had his share of back problems during his career, and says that although he had surgery in July, 1994, to address his physical pains, he learned to play around his back ailments and remain competitive at the elite PGA Tour level. He thinks Woods\u2019 problems are rooted in poor swing technique that Woods has been repeating over and over for years. Mediate says it was only Woods\u2019 other worldly talents that made up for his weakness in his swing. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of interesting issues with my back over the last so many years, especially in the mid-90s when I had surgery,\u201d says Mediate. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this, and it might be shocking: I pretty much disagree that (Woods) is physically finished or won\u2019t be able to contend again because of his spine. I completely disagree with that. There are ways around it. I know those ways. It\u2019s definitely the way you swing the golf club \u2014 that\u2019s 99.9% of it.

And you saw what that did,\u201d Mediate continues. \u201cIn other words, even though Tiger was in perfect physical shape, he broke. That tells me a story. The only thing we do repetitively is swing a golf club, hundreds and hundreds of times a day. What do you think is going to cause a person to break when they swing a golf club hundreds of times a day? I can tell you what that is without the answer \u2014 swinging a golf club the wrong way will cause breakage. Period. And that\u2019s what happened. Simple as that.\u201d"]
["amp/sports/more-sports", " Butch Harmon, a respected name in the sport, was Woods\u2019 swing coach from the early \u201990s through 2004, a period in which Woods routinely dominated the field and won his first eight majors. Woods then switched to Hank Haney and won six more major championships before dumping Haney in 2010 and replacing him with Sean Foley. Foley then got jettisoned for Chris Como, Woods\u2019 current coach. Bill Harmon, Butch\u2019s younger brother and a golf instructor at Toscana Country Club in Indian Wells, Calif., says that he thinks Woods must address several issues \u2014 not the least of which is regaining his health \u2014 before he can even focus on trying to win tournaments again. And yes, Bill Harmon agrees with Mediate that Woods\u2019 swing is partly to blame for his woes. \u201c(Woods) is so concerned about distance, and he\u2019s just not going to hit as far as these younger guys again, and he doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d says Harmon. \u201cBut beyond the immense physical talent he has, Tiger was always a great golf course manager. If the goal is to get explosiveness on drives, that is contrary to his intelligence over the years. He also needs to develop a swing that doesn\u2019t put pressure on his back. And his short game is not what it used to be. He had the greatest short game in the history of golf.

Purita performed the stem cell procedure on Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon\u2019s right elbow and rotator cuff in 2010, and he says back surgery generally creates more problems than solutions in the long run."]
["amp/sports/more-sports", "\u201cWe know that a lot of times back surgery is not the answer. What happens is, these people get better for six months a year and then they are worse off down the road, because you\u2019ve traded one problem for a lot of other problems,\u201d says Purita. \u201cThe best thing for back problems is to go conservatively initially. You really want to exhaust all of your conservative measures. \u201cOne of the most important things you could ever do is physical therapy. It\u2019s crucial,\u201d continues Purita. He says that a patient with back trouble should initially try rest and heat, taking Ibuprofen and doing physical therapy. Purita also suggests trying an epidural to relieve pain. \u201cWhen those all fail, and you\u2019re still symptomatic, then you start saying, \u2018Maybe stem cell.\u2019 Stem cells are much safer and in general, a much better alternative than surgery. We don\u2019t really burn bridges with stem cells. Surgery, you\u2019re burning a lot of bridges,\u201d says Purita. Fred Couples, another veteran golfer and the 1992 Masters champ, also dealt with back pain and discomfort as far back as 1994, according to his longtime golf instructor, Paul Marchand.

He didn\u2019t want to take that chance.\u201d Woods took a chance playing the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines on a bum left knee and leg, and wound up beating Mediate on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff, which followed an 18-hole playoff round.

["sports/baseball/mets", "Jacob deGrom likely due for big Mets pay bump - NY Daily News Jacob deGrom should get his first big payday this spring. The Mets right-hander, who did not sign his contract last spring to protest his salary, will qualify for salary arbitration early, according to the annual projections by MLBTraderumors.com for the Super 2 cutoff. Like so much with the MLB\u2019s current collective bargaining agreement ending in December, these numbers are in limbo. Major league service times have not been fully calculated yet and the league and union are still debating issues like Super 2 as they try to hammer out a new collective bargaining agreement, which could affect the final numbers. But deGrom seems likely to be the only Met who will safely meet the qualifications. DeGrom should have two years, 139 days of service time, meaning he is well above the projected cutoff for Super 2. That means he would be among the 22% of players called up in 2014 who will qualify for an extra year of salary arbitration, according to MLBTraderumors.com\u2019s calculations. That would begin this winter as the new CBA is put into effect.  Explaining baseball\u2019s Super Two rule   When deGrom protested his $607,000 salary last spring by not signing the contract, it was a technicality because he is under the Mets control through 2020 and the pitcher had no other recourse. The team has a choice between offering a contract to players under their control or simply renewing them."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "The Mets offered deGrom more than the major league minimum of $507,500 and deGrom said last spring\u2019s salary issue would not affect his relationship with the franchise. Despite coming off what he called a disappointing season because of injuries, deGrom is due a significant pay bump. For example, Matt Harvey went from making $614,000 in 2014 to earning $4.5 million in his first year of salary arbitration. DeGrom has put together an impressive resume in over two and a half years. He is 30-22 with a 2.74 ERA in 76 starts. He ended this season with surgery to move the ulnar nerve in his elbow, which was a major reason for his frustrations.  Mets' Jacob deGrom is in the dark about Yoenis Cespedes' decision  It came after a brilliant first year and a half in the majors. He was an unexpected 2014 Rookie of the Year after getting called up as bullpen help in May of that year.

Generally, most major league players need to complete three years (173 days equals a year) of service time to qualify for salary arbitration, a process they can go through three times before being granted free agency."]

They earn an extra year of salary arbitration, qualifying before they hit the three-year mark. \u00a0 The Mets have several players who would be looking at salary bumps through arbitration, along with some other questions this winter. Closer Jeurys Familia and set-up man Addison Reed are looking at significant increases in salary for 2017, likely close to double their current salaries. Among those who are arbitration eligible for the first time are catcher Travis d'Arnaud and pitchers Jim Henderson and Zack Wheeler, which could make for some interesting decisions for the Mets.

["sports/football/giants", "Giants sign offensive lineman D.J. Fluker to one-year deal - NY Daily News D.J. Fluker gives the Giants three former first-round picks on their offensive line. Does that mean Big Blue's front finally will dominate the line of scrimmage the way coach Ben McAdoo hopes? Fluker, who turns 26 on Monday, agreed to a one-year contract worth a reported $3 million with the Giants on Saturday night, the Daily News has confirmed. The Chargers drafted the 6-5, 339-pounder as a tackle out of Alabama 11th overall in 2013 but eventually moved him to guard. They cut the underachieving Fluker after four years rather than pick up his expensive fifth-year option, sending him to free agency this spring. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo first reported Fluker's deal with the Giants. Jerry Reese already has two of his own first round picks trying to protect Eli Manning in left tackle Ereck Flowers (ninth overall, 2015) and left guard Justin Pugh (19th overall, 2013). But the key word there, for Flowers specifically, is \"trying.\" Flowers, who turns 23 in April, has struggled badly after two seasons protecting Manning's blind side. The presumption was that the Giants therefore would make left tackle a priority in the free agency or the draft - especially after Reese acknowledged it was time to consider moving Flowers to right tackle or guard. Fluker, however, would seem to be in New York as a swing tackle/guard at best, not as the answer to all of Flowers' problems on the left, given his struggles on the blind side of Philip Rivers in San Diego."]
["sports/football/giants", "This year's draft class of offensive linemen also is not particularly deep, though the Giants could go after Wisconsin's Ryan Ramczyk or Utah mauler Garett Bolles if they're still there at Big Blue's pick at 23. Both are left tackles. The reason the Giants went bargain shopping is because of how expensive the top end of the left tackle market became in free agency, read the annual average for contracts paid to the likes of Russell Okung (Chargers, $13.25), Riley Reiff (Vikings, $11.75 million), Andrew Whitworth (Rams, $11.25) The Giants entered free agency with below $35 million of cap space and committed about half of it to Jason Pierre-Paul's one-year franchise tag ($16.9 million). And while the decision may have hindered Reese's flexibility, the market for pass rushers is keeping long-term deals for players of Pierre-Paul's caliber not far from that number. Plus, with Pierre-Paul injured, Olivier Vernon and the Giants defensive line generated very little pressure on Aaron Rodgers in a 38-13 blowout Wild Card loss in Green Bay. The defense needs attention, too."]

A new federal lawsuit accuses the ubiquitous coffee chain of putting less liquid than advertised in its iced beverages, and dumping in lots of ice to cover it up.

Steve Kerr is being out-coached by a rookie while Draymond Green, who would have been better off suspended for Game 4, could use a good kick in the rear to get him going. America's darlings are on the brink. And that magnificent regular season that the Golden State Warriors produced will have a giant asterisk next to it. As in, *Did Not Win Title. Those record 73 wins aren't helping the Warriors in the Western Conference finals. In fact, one more loss and they will be ridiculed for failing to cap their historic season with a championship. And just think of the ramifications if Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant take one more game and advance to the NBA Finals for the second time in five years. The 82-game regular season, which is at least 16 games to long to begin with, will be deemed meaningless. (And the league's dream matchup, Curry vs. LeBron, will be kaput.)  You're building an NBA team: Are you picking LeBron or Curry?  OKC finished 18 games behind Golden State. To put that in perspective, the Knicks finished 25 games behind the Cleveland Cavaliers. And we already know the Knicks season was meaningless."]
["sports/basketball", "The Warriors are facing long odds to win Games 5, 6 and 7, starting Thursday in Oakland. There have been 232 playoff series where one team has led three games to one. The team trailing has battled back and won just nine times. That includes the 1997 Knicks, who sabotaged their season by getting into that infamous Game 5 fight with the Miami Heat. There's an idea: maybe Green can kick his way into a brawl that results in Durant and Westbrook being suspended. Green's boot to Steven Adams' groin in Game 3 was one of the rare times he struck his intended target. In his last two games, Green has made just 2 of 16 shots and was a combined minus-73 in Games 3 & 4. Curry wasn't much better. He shot 6 for 20 in OKC's 118-94 Game 4 victory and has been outclassed by Westbrook, who recorded a triple-double as the Thunder were handing the Warriors their first two-game losing streak of the season.  Thunder rout Warriors, take 3-1 lead in Western Conference finals  It is clear that Curry, who suffered a sprained knee in the first round, is hurting. But no one wants to hear that about the only unanimous MVP in league history. If LeBron James, Kobe Bryant or even Carmelo Anthony were struggling like Curry they'd be eviscerated for disappearing in a conference finals. OKC head coach Billy Donovan has used a variety of long defenders to harass Curry. And when Curry runs around screens, the Thunder bump him. Their strategy has been flawless."]

If it ever reaches a Game 7, it's hard to bet against the Warriors at home.  Bondy: NBA should have suspended Warriors' Draymond Green   But the Warriors appear to have met their match. It wasn't 73 wins that may do them in but rather a bad match-up against a long, athletic team. And Curry isn't himself. Last year, the Warriors had luck on their side in the playoffs. Not this time. The karma is also bad. Earlier this season Warriors owner Joe Lacob raised eye brows when he told the New York Times magazine: \"We're light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we're going to go about things. We're going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.\" Light years? The darkness of a long off season may be just days away. \"The series isn't over,\" Curry said \"We've got to believe in ourselves. There's obviously frustration.

President Obama opened a brief trip to Saudi Arabia Wednesday with a one-on-one meeting with King Salman\u00a0in Riyadh, as new evidence emerged linking officials within the shadowy kingdom to the 9/11 attacks. Citing documents posted to 28pages.org, an activist site working to expose links between foreign governments and 9/11, The Times of London reported that a Saudi citizen who later became a bomb-maker for al Qaeda was thought to have taken pilot lessons with some of the 9/11 hijackers.

Al-Sharbi, who did not participate in the 9/11 attacks, was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and remains incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. The newly unearthed evidence, however, underscores renewed suspicions of Saudi involvement in the horrific terror attacks and growing criticism over Obama\u2019s opposition to legislation that would give victims\u2019 families the right to sue the Saudi government for any role it may have played in the terror attacks."]

Schmitt-Matzen, 61, soon made the rounds of local and national television \u2014\u00a0often repeating the story verbatim, sometimes while tearing up. Dozens of outlets picked up the story, including the Daily News. The News Sentinel said it first reached out to Schmitt-Matzen after a \"known source\" sent a tip about his tale. In his initial interview, Schmitt-Matzen swore he promised to protect the identities of the child and his family. But the paper\u2019s later attempts to independently verify the Christmas tale had \u201cproven unsuccessful.\u201d"]

The Central Jakarta District Court found Jessica Kumala Wongso, 28, guilty of murdering Wayan Mirna Salihin at an upmarket Jakarta cafe in January. Salihin collapsed and died after sipping iced coffee at the cafe while Wongso was present. The two had been classmates at Billy Blue College of Design in Sydney, Australia. Wongso's lawyers said they would appeal. Blanket television coverage of the trial transfixed Indonesians with its window into the lives of privileged young women and the country's often arbitrary legal system. There were several unsuccessful attempts to bring the case to trial before it finally began in June, reflecting the weakness of the evidence and questions over the alleged motive for the murder.  Driver texts from wrecked Lamborghini after fatal race  The judges, however, agreed with the prosecutors' contention that Wongso was angry that Salihin had suggested she break up with a troublesome boyfriend and was jealous of Salihin's own relationship. The alleged motive, however, was ridiculed by defense lawyers who said it \"could not be accepted by common sense.\""]

Humphries, 28, didn\u2019t have to fly to L.A. for the settlement meeting \u2013 which Kardashian, 32, attended \u2013 and instead was at the Nets\u2019 practice in New Jersey. He was hoping to take the divorce to court, which was scheduled for May 6, but realized he would\u2019ve had to miss games in order to get his marriage annulled on the premise that it was a sham created for reality TV. Kardashian, now expecting a baby with rapper Kanye West, wanted a regular divorce based on their prenup. According to TMZ, Humphries will not receive a dime from the settlement. The pair's court battle started soon after Kardashian pulled the plug on their 72-day union on Oct. 31, 2011. She immediately denied she married Humphries for the sake of her reality shows. \"I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision,\" the buxom brunette said after filing her petition. \"I had hoped this marriage was forever but sometimes things don't work out as planned.\" The Nets weren\u2019t happy about the prospect of Humphries missing games or practices following a meeting on the subject, making his decision easier. He had skipped a previous divorce settlement meeting on April 12 to be with the Nets in Indianapolis."]

The release, expected Monday, will be the first major development in the investigation since a preliminary report a few weeks after the May 12 crash in which the National Transportation Safety Board pinpointed excessive speed as a key factor. A final report isn\u2019t expected for months. The train was accelerating out of an 80 mph speed zone when it should have been slowing to 50 mph for the coming curve, investigators said.

The governor had planned similar fundraisers for the World Series, but abruptly cancelled them after critics questioned the $5,500-per-person price tag, with some accusing Cuomo of political ticket scalping. \u201cThere was no (World Series) fundraisers, so no expenses were paid,\u201d the campaign spokesman said. Cuomo\u2019s campaign also paid $300,000 to the attorneys that represented the governor in U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\u2019s probe of the Moreland Commission closure. Bharara announced this week that he did not plan to bring charges in the matter.

Officials are checking out Papini\u2019s past and know about her previous marriage and divorce. They are looking into her online activity before she went missing and have obtained 20 warrants for data.

["sports/more-sports", "Tiger Woods shoots awful 80 at U.S. Open - NY Daily News UNIVERSITY PLACE, Wash. \u2013 How could anyone once that good be this bad? Two weeks ago, Tiger Woods shot his highest score ever, a third-round 85 at the Memorial, a tournament he had won five times. Thursday, he lowered his bar at the U.S. Open, which he has won three times, with a career-worst 80, beating the 76 he shot at Oakland Hills way back in 1996 before he turned pro. It was the third time this season Woods shot in the 80s. If Woods has lost his golf game, at least his sense of humor is in tact. \u201cThe bright side is at least I kicked Rickie\u2019s butt today,\u201d he said. LIVE LEADERBOARD: SEE WHO'S WHERE AT U.S. OPEN Indeed, playing partner Rickie Fowler, who was among the pre-tournament favorites, was just one of two players in the field Woods beat. Fowler shot 81, and assistant pro Rich Beberian Jr. shot 83. With Louis Oosthuizen shooting 77, the USGA\u2019s feature group combined to shoot 28-over par. Woods starts his second round 15 shots behind co-leaders Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson, in 152nd place. The debacle at Chambers Bay, where he hit a few shots that resembled those of the public golfers and elicited groans and laughs from the gallery, will surely send him home early and extend his winless streak in majors to 22. He last won at Torrey Pines in the 2008 U.S. Open."]

The only smile during the round came on the 10th hole where he provided a glimpse into his brilliant past by nearly holing out from a tough lie in the greenside bunker. But while he turned down a request for a TV interview from Fox Sports, he met the print media and actually was somewhat cheery. \u201cNot very happy, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tough day. Got off to a bad start. I stuck that 6-iron in the ground on the first hole, and then just couldn\u2019t quite get it turned around today. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things, just got to work through it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying as hard as I can to do it, and for some reason I just can\u2019t get the consistency that I\u2019d like to have out there. Woods\u2019 day began quite nicely. He drilled his opening tee shot down the middle. Then it all went wrong very quickly. He chunked his approach shot into the thick greenside fescue and made bogey. As he consistently drove into the hay, he would bogey three of his first four holes and four of his first six, missing a birdie putt on No. 2."]

The seven, on the 528-yard 14th, found him hitting three shots from the sand and three-putting the green. And, after making a three-footer for a birdie on 16, Woods may have suffered his worst indignity on the final hole. He cold-topped his second shot from the fairway and it skittered into Chambers Basement, the bunker put in especially for the U.S. Open.

If Rome wasn't built in a day, then what chance do the Jets have? Mike Maccagnan purposely laid low during free agency as he continues to set a proper foundation through the draft. Breaking the bank in free agency would have been a mistake. So, you saw affordable short-term deals in free agency. Maccagnan must hit on his premium picks this year, though. Woody Johnson hired him, in part, because of his scouting background. It's time to nail these early-round picks and maybe one or two late, too. The plan requires patience, which is not exactly what fans want to hear after suffering for the better part of four decades. But it has to be done. I've readily admitted that the jury is still out on whether Maccagnan will be a good, average or poor general manager. But he deserves a fair chance to build this roster. He obviously doesn't have a lifetime appointment, but building a sustainable winner doesn't magically happen. It takes thoughtful planning \u2026 and time."]

For a team that is devoid of talent, this is a huge obstacle during a rebuild. The Rams have holes at almost every position imaginable, so missing out on the Top 35 players in the draft will sting a little. In the second round, the Rams will kick the tires on OT Taylor Moton, as they try to stabilize their offensive line to help regain the confidence of their star Todd Gurley. We expect this team to focus heavily on the offensive line in this draft, as it will be the only way for them to compete while Goff continues to learn the game at this level. With their subsequent two selections, they will look to build depth on the defensive side, which struggled with injuries in 2016. New head coach Sean McVay will get a quick taste of life as an NFL coach during this draft, as he is many pieces away from even doubling his win total in his first year. Hopefully, the Rams\u2019 front office has the patience required to give him time to build things his way."]
["amp/sports/football", "Even in a horrible year Fantasy-wise, Gurley was the leading points scorer for this team, which tells you just how bad this team was on offense last season. As an owner who drafted Gurley in the first round last season, I don\u2019t have to tell you just how awful his season was. Consensus had him as the second-best running back available in drafts, but if you pulled the trigger in the first round you likely failed to make the playoffs in your league. The inconsistent play at quarterback hindered this offense all season long. Couple that with the hesitancy in Gurley\u2019s running style and it spelled doom for his Fantasy value. The only bright spot in all of this for Gurley was the uptick in his receptions. His 43 catches gave him some extra value in PPR formats, but his six TDs really brought him back down to Earth. Given the presumed emphasis on bulking up the offensive line with this draft, Gurley has to be licking his chops to prove last year was just a fluke. I expect him to rebound in 2017, getting back above the 1,000 yard mark along with close to 50 receptions. This will put Gurley inside the Top 12 at the position and based upon last year\u2019s performance, owners could find him at quite the discount in drafts."]
["amp/sports/football", "If the Rams are hoping for Goff to take that next step as the franchise QB, they will have to do a better job of surrounding him with talent at the skill positions. Robert Woods and Tavon Austin as the two starting wide receivers is not going to get it done. This team is without a true star at wide receiver, and the potential to draft one is always there. But without a selection in the first round, and a crack at one of the top tier guys, what they will be left with could be hit or miss. So, I expect for the Rams to ride what they have, and employ a ground and pound technique, along with a stout defense, to lead them to victories. Do not expect Goff to make any tremors in the world of Fantasy in 2017; he will be a QB that I would be shocked to be rostered during the season in any format. The Fantasy fortunes for this team lend themselves primarily just to Gurley and the defense without any other threats for the year. The Rams will be a team that owners will avoid come draft time.

["sports", "Rumble in the Jungle! Muhammad Ali wins by KO in 8 - NY Daily News (Daily News archives - Originally published on Wednesday, Oct. 30, 1974 - written by Phil Pepe) Boxing lives! Muhammad Ali is back! Forget the flowers, cancel the eulogy, scrub the dirge. Get ready for more talk, more boasting, more poetry. Muhammad Ali is heavyweight champion of the world again. In the most stirring, most spectacular fight of his career, the 32-year-old former, and once again, heavyweight champion of the world became only the second man in boxing history to regain the heavyweight title last night when he knocked George Foreman flat in 2:58 of the eighth round in their \"rumble in the jungle\" in Kinshasa, Zaire. Only Floyd Patterson before him had lost his title and won it back. Now Muhammad Ali has done it, too, upsetting the oddsmakers, who had made him a 3-1 underdog, upsetting the experts who said, at 32, he was too old, and removing the cloak of invincibility that had been draped around the broad powerful shoulders of the 25-year-old Foreman. The cloak had been put there because Foreman had won all of his 40 professional fights, 37 of them by knockout, giving him the best knockout record in the history of the heavyweight division, better than John L. Sullivan, better than Jack Dempsey, better than Joe Louis, better than Rocky Marciano, better than everybody. This was to be the heavyweight fight to end all heavyweight fights, a $40-million spectacular in Africa at four in the morning."]
["sports", "And it was to be the heavyweight fight to end the glamorous, controversial career of Muhammad Ali, who won the title from Sonny Liston on Miami Beach, 12,000 miles and 10 years away from where he had his greatest moment last night. But seen here in Madison Square Garden on closed-circuit TV, and with the benefit of a replay of the climactic round, the end came when Ali unleashed a five-punch sequence, ending with a smashing right to the jaw. Foreman seemed to stumble over his own feet and went down on his side. He rolled over on his back as referee Zack Clayton picked up the count. Foreman got to his feet on wobbly legs, but it was too late. Clayton had completed the 10 count. It was over. There were no other knockdowns. Perhaps because of Foreman's rushing, charging tactics, perhaps because it was in his blueprint, Ali was forced to fight, rather than dance. And fight he did, consistently beating Foreman to the punch and throwing the heavier bombs, although it is Foreman who has the reputation as a puncher. It was more of a brawl than the Harvest Moon Ball and Muhammad the dancer became Muhammad the Brawler. He allowed himself to fight with his back against the ropes, throwing both hands up to protect his face and letting Foreman punch himself tired."]
["sports", "Most of Foreman's blows landed on Ali leather and were totally ineffectual. Then, once George was spent and arms weary, Ali would cut loose with a barrage of shots to the head that gradually took their toll on the 220-pound (3 \u00bc pounds heavier than Ali) Foreman. It was exactly such a barrage that ended the fight in the eighth and exactly such a barrage that led to Foreman's demise in the fifth. Ali had stayed with his back on the ropes for more than a minute, just parrying, blocking. Suddenly, like an enraged lion, Muhammad sprung from the ropes and ripped a series of lefts and rights that snapped Foreman's head back. From that point on, the competitiveness seemed to ooze out of Foreman and when he went to his corner at the end of the round it was on legs of rubber. It was remarkable and extremely enlightening to see powerful, mammoth, awesome Foreman turn to nothing before your eyes. As the rounds went on he grew weaker, less awesome, smaller. Just about once in each round Ali would rock the 25-year-old now ex-champ. By the third round, George seemed befuddled. In the fourth, Ali unleashed a right-left-right combination that hurt his opponent. The pattern was repeated through the fifth and six and by the seventh Foreman looked completely exhausted, totally inept, embarrassingly amateurish."]
["sports", "When Ali chose to punch, he did so with precision, with crackling lefts and rights to the head that repeatedly snapped Foreman's head back. And as the strength and the enthusiasm for the fight escaped from Foreman's hulking body, it appeared only a matter of time before Ali would get the job done. The time came in the eight. The bell rang for what was to be the final round. On the scorecard of The News, Ali was comfortably ahead, five rounds to two, having won every round except the second and the seventh, which he had used to summon up his energy for the kill. Now, in the eight, Ali was on the ropes, covering up as he had done most of the night. Foreman threw weak, lazy lefts and rights that landed, again, on Muhammad's gloves. The gloves were a protection for Ali's face and he let Foreman use himself up. Suddenly, when he felt the time was right, Ali bounced off the ropes and shot a straight right to the head, one of a hundred right leads he shot at Foreman's head. Quickly, he followed it up with a left to the head, almost as if it was one punch. As soon as the left was sent home, another right was on its way and it, too, found its mark on Foreman's kisser. In a flash, Ali threw two more punches, a left to the face and a right to the head, the five punches coming rapid-fire, within an instant."]
["sports", "The last one did it. That's when Foreman stumbled, tilting the crown that he wore precariously on his head, and the count went to 10. George Foreman was out, an ex-champion at the age of 25, and the era of Muhammad Ali was still not ended. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video."]

Their 1-5-1 meltdown from Dec. 9-18 \u2014 averaging 4.7 goals against in a seven-game stretch against bad-to-mediocre teams \u2014 provided confirmation the Blueshirts' early-season breakdowns had not been anomalies. Henrik Lundqvist's brilliance had accounted for a franchise-record 14-2-2 start, but there was always an uncharacteristic disconnect between this franchise's Stanley Cup aspirations and their ugly reality that reared its head for the final time in Saturday afternoon's 6-3 elimination laugher in Pittsburgh: Suddenly, the traditionally blue-collar Rangers weren't always the hardest working team on the ice, like Bryan Rust's muscling of Derick Brassard on Matt Cullen's goal in Saturday's runaway second period. YOU'RE THE GM: RANGERS KEEP 'EM, DUMP 'EM INTERACTIVE They weren't defensively committed or equipped enough to nip opponents' momentum in the bud, like the trifecta of mistakes committed by Kevin Klein, Keith Yandle and Derek Stepan prior to Carl Hagelin's game-tying goal in this season-ending defeat. They weren't cohesive enough to protect leads, thanks also to a 28th-ranked penalty kill, where Jesper Fast and Lundqvist were outclassed by Sidney Crosby and Phil Kessel on a back-breaking game-tying goal before Pittsburgh's second-period storm. Most alarmingly, a group filled with mentally tough pros couldn't escape a worrisome quality of fragility. When games went badly this season, they went off the deep end, just as Games 4 and 5 of this first-round series went for the Blueshirts, who were outscored in the series 21-10."]

He showed blind loyalty to Kevin Hayes, one of the team's primary culprits in insufficient work ethic, the majority of the year. But with the Rangers' season on the line, he did not dress him.

That was my team \u2013 Garret Anderson, a young K-Rod (Francisco Rodriguez), Tim Salmon, Darin Erstad, Troy Percival. And Chone Figgins was my favorite player growing up,\" says Smith, the Mets' touted first-base prospect who was a non-roster invitee to spring training. \"Figgins, he inspired me. He played third, short, second, the outfield. I wanted to be able to play everywhere like him.\" The 6-foot, 185-pound Smith is stocky and has a sturdy build like the versatile Figgins had during his 12-year playing career, and Mets general manager Sandy Alderson calls the 21-year-old Smith \"an outstanding prospect\" that the organization is \"very high on\" entering the 2017 season and beyond. But Smith is also one of a handful of first-round draft picks who benefitted from Major League Baseball's Compton, Calif., baseball academy, situated in one of Los Angeles' grittier neighborhoods. In the past, Compton was rife with crime, gang violence and drugs, famously captured in the lyrics of the gangsta rap group N.W.A's songs. But the South Central L.A.-born Smith admits that while kids growing up in his old neighborhood still face challenges and adversity, the city overall has evolved and changed for the better."]

Statistically, the number of African-Americans playing baseball has dropped since the 1980s when L.A. products like Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis were part of a sizeable African-American population dominating the majors. Whether Smith ascends to the heights reached by Strawberry and Davis \u2013 both World Series champions \u2013 remains to be seen, but the young first baseman has his sights set on becoming part of the Mets' future youth movement, as well as being part of a new wave of Los Angeles baseball playmakers. \"He's a dominating player already,\" says Davis, 54, the former Reds slugger who was one of several former major leaguers who helped coach and mentor Smith while he was training at the Compton academy. \"I hope he gets a chance to prove himself with the Mets.\" * * *"]

But I like some of the stuff some of the younger guys in the game are trying to do, make it fun again.\" In a 2016 ESPN the Magazine feature, Nationals superstar Bryce Harper called baseball \"a tired sport,\" and Smith says there is some truth in Harper's opinion, but that the game could reverse that label by embracing \"having a good time, laughing and smiling\" more. \"It's going to be hard to do. When you pimp home runs, or, as a pitcher you celebrate after a strikeout, a lot of players have thin skin and they get kind of hurt about it,\" says Smith. He laughs when asked if he likes to admire his own homers. \"Of course!\" he says."]

Or you see (Panthers quarterback) Cam Newton in the end zone dancing \u2013 as a kid, who wouldn't want to do that?\" says Smith. \"They may show a home run highlight, but to a kid, that may not be as interesting as you seeing a touchdown highlight, where they're dancing, having a good time. I think it will be tough to really make it fun like that, but if we are able to do more exciting things, get more pro guys to go into those (inner-city) areas, invite them out to games, I feel like it will make them want to gravitate toward baseball more than basketball or football.\" Davis and Strawberry think that academies like the one in Compton are a stepping stone toward steering young black men toward America's pastime, but neither former All-Star sees any uptick in African-Americans playing baseball happening overnight. \"Basketball has a global attraction,\" says Strawberry, the L.A. product who went to Crenshaw High School and later starred with the Mets and Yankees, winning four World Series rings. \"You need to market the academies well, market those inner-city areas, continue to bring former players to coach and work with young players.\" Strawberry, who turns 55 Sunday, says that while the hurdles he and Davis and other peers faced back in the '70s and early '80s were formidable, baseball not only gave them an avenue out of trouble, but also fostered a competitive environment so that he and other players wanted to keep excelling in the sport week to week."]

We knew everyone on the other team was very good.\" Davis, whose friendship with Strawberry stretches back to their L.A. childhood days, says that having an academy smack in the middle of South Central L.A. provides the type of what he calls a \"safe haven\" for kids. Safe havens were harder to come by during his and Strawberry's childhood. It also doesn't hurt that the Compton academy has, according to Davis, \"phenomenal facilities.\" \"When I was growing up, it was gangs, or drugs or the cemetery. A lot of times you had single mothers who had to work two jobs and didn't have time to pick up a glove. The issue is to make baseball an option, give kids an opportunity to utilize their options,\" says Davis, who won a World Series on the 1990 Reds, and who now works in player development for the Reds. \"It's a safe haven, and any time you're talking about the inner city, it's about safety. Not everybody is going to play in the NBA or in the majors or the NFL, but the more options you have \u2013 training and learning at an academy like the one in Compton \u2013 the better chance that you have fulfilling a career as an athlete.\" * * *"]

Power's starting to come,\" says Alderson of Smith. \"And he's a very confident, well-liked individual among his teammates. We're very high on Dom. Whether he sees any time at the major-league level this year depends on what transpires at the major-league level during the first part of the season, as well as what he's able to do at Las Vegas.\" There have already been several \"Panic Citi\" moments for Mets fans early this spring training \u2013 first baseman Lucas Duda's back cramped up in late February.

They couldn't get that can very far, and the championship window for these Rangers as constructed may very well have closed on Saturday, a reality 34-year-old Henrik Lundqvist certainly hopes isn't true.

But Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla warned plainly a month ago that \"the debt is not payable.\" After all, the island's economy has been contracting for a decade. With unemployment over 12%, thousands are fleeing to the continental U.S. annually. This year alone, $2.8 billion in debt payments are due \u2014 17% of government revenues. And next year, it will climb to 20%. You can't fix an economy that's drowning in debt. In a crisis like that, the average person, the average city or corporation, would resort to bankruptcy protection. General Motors did it. So did Detroit. So did Orange County, Calif., years ago. Gov. Garcia Padilla has one of the country's top rescue experts advising him, former Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch. He's the same guy who helped save our city from financial collapse in the 1970s and who was involved in Detroit's debt restructuring. Ravitch has been selflessly working as a volunteer."]
["news/national", "But that analyst who likened a Puerto Rico default to suicide doesn't have a clue. Like so many in the financial industry, he ignores how Puerto Rico's crisis is rooted in Washington's long history of unequal policy toward the island, a policy that blocks any turnaround. \"Puerto Rico remains a colony of the United States,\" says Bronx Rep. Jose Serrano. \"It is treated differently even though its 3.5 million residents are U.S. citizens.\" The legal basis for that unequal treatment goes back to a series of Supreme Court decisions in the early 1900s known as the Insular Cases. In one of them,, Downes vs. Bidwell, Justice Edward White ruled that only those parts of the Constitution apply in U.S. territorial possessions that Congress chooses to apply. Puerto Rico, White concluded, belonged to, but was not part of, the United States. Ever since the Insular Cases, all major decisions involving the island have depended on acts of Congress \u2014 an institution where island residents have no vote. In 1996, for instance, President Bill Clinton agreed to eliminate a tax loophole for U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico as part of a deal with Republicans in Congress to increase the federal minimum wage. The result was massive industrial flight from the island and increased borrowing by Puerto Rico to pay expenses. Even now, Puerto Rico's government needs permission from Congress just to allow some of its institutions to restructure their debts."]

The late \"Sopranos\" star's will is \"a disaster\" that could see over $30 million of his estimated $70 million estate go to the government, a top estate lawyer told the Daily News. \"It's a nightmare from a tax standpoint,\" said William Zabel, who reviewed the document at The News' request. The 51-year-old's \"big mistake\" was leaving 80% of his estate to his sisters and his 9-month-old daughter, Zabel said. That made 80% of the estate subject to \"death taxes\" of about 55%, and the bill is due in nine months, Zabel said. That means his family will have to start selling off his property and liquidating his assets soon in order to pay the tab, since it's unlikely the actor had tens of millions of dollars in cash on hand. \"The government doesn't accept the fact that it's difficult to come up with the money you owe,\" said the lawyer, who's represented the likes of billionaire George Soros and \"King of All Media\" Howard Stern. \"They can get an extension of time to pay the entire amount, but they're going to have pay a substantial amount in nine months.\" The 20 percent of the estate that Gandolfini left to wife Deborah Lin isn't directly subject to the death tax, but even she'll take a big hit, Zabel said."]

He also had a separate trust fund set up for his wife and at least one other for his 13-year-old, son Michael. Michael's includes a $7 million life insurance payout, which would not be affected by the will issues. It's unclear at this point if royalties from Gandolfini's film career and his work on \"The Sopranos\" will go directly into the estate or to his wife through a separate trust. If that money is going into the estate, it too will be subject to the death tax, Zabel said. He said there are ways for the beloved actor's family to get out from under the enormous tax burden, but it would be tricky. One solution could be for the sisters and daughter to renounce their shares in the estate for payments later on down the road. Gandolfini's lawyer and one of the executors of his estate, Roger Haber, did not return a call for comment on Friday. Gandolfini died of a massive heart attack while on a trip to Rome with his son last month."]

Marcy Wudarski Gandolfini, who was married to the beloved stage and screen actor for three years and is mother to his son Michael, has listed the pad, at 99 Jane St., with Julie Rupprecht of Halstead Property. The former couple assembled the stunning four-bedroom pad, three-bathroom pad over several years before calling time on their marriage in 2002. They paid $850,000 for one unit and just over $1 million for a second, eventually combining them into one massive home. Wudarski famously accused her ex of drug and alchohol abuse during their short union. When they divorced, the apartment went to Wudarski and Gandolfini went on to marry Deborah Lin, mother of his daughter Liliana Ruth. He later died of a heart attack in 2013 while vacationing in Italy with his and Wudarski\u2019s son.

As Jorge Cayetano was in a holding cell awaiting arraignment in front of Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Claudia DePeyster, he suffered a seizure, fell on the floor and struck his head, sources said. Cayetano, 33, was transported to a local hospital for treatment, delaying his court appearance where he is charged with felony assault for hitting little Alec Li with a 22-ounce bottle of Olde English on Tuesday. A chunk of Li's forehead was ripped out when Cayetano allegedly hurled the large glass bottle that was intended for some men he was arguing with outside of the Gold Star Supermarket on Fifth Ave. and 60th St. in Sunset Park. Cayetano was hit with a slew of charges including assault, menacing, harassment and criminal possession of a weapon. If convicted with the top charge, Cayetano faces up to seven years in prison."]

It snapped in two. Add it to the list of club-throwing episodes from one of the world\u2019s top golfers. McIlroy had slipped out of realistic contention during the third round at Royal Troon on Saturday when he pushed right his approach shot from the middle of the fairway. He reacted by hurling the 3-wood to the ground in front of him, and the head flew off.  Phil Mickelson maintains lead by a stroke at rainy British Open  \u201cThe club head came loose on it earlier on the week and I had to get the head re-glued. So it was probably partly to do with that,\u201d McIlroy said, \u201cand partly the throw as well.\u201d McIlroy was already frustrated after making three bogeys in his first five holes. He dropped another shot at No. 15 after letting a 3-iron from the fairway slip right, and things came to a head, so to speak, on the next hole. \u201cI did the exact same thing there,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cSo it was basically just a bad swing. No one likes to make the same mistake twice. \u201cI\u2019ll get it reshafted tonight. The truck\u2019s here, so I\u2019ll have it reshafted, and all will be well in the morning.\u201d"]

With Wednesday being the deadline for teams to place a franchise tag on players, here\u2019s a look at some that organizations who wish they chose to let their once-coveted play walk. Giants place franchise tag on Jason Pierre-Paul The Panthers never could\u2019ve guessed what was coming when they gave the franchise tag to Greg Hardy in 2014. Just three months after the move, Hardy was charged with assaulting his ex-girlfriend. He played in just one game before being placed on commissioner\u2019s exempt list for the remainder of the season. Hardy collected all of his $13.4 million salary despite not being permitted to play. Both Hardy and the franchise looked bad because of the incident and the Panthers chose to cut him in March 2015. The Panthers essentially paid millions of dollars for one sack and a highly scrutinized defensive end. Major players normally get franchise tagged, like Steelers running back Le\u2019veon Bell and Pierre-Paul. Which is why it\u2019s surprising the Giants once used one on Brandon Jacobs in 2009. Jacobs was rewarded with a 4-year 25 million contract with the Giants shortly after being tagged to be the team\u2019s No. 1 running back. He led the Giants with carries in 2009, but only put up 835 yards and five touchdowns on 224 carries."]
["amp/sports/football", "Ahmad Bradshaw broke onto the scene and soon the Giants backfield became a two-headed monster. Jacobs would get goal line carries because he was a big bruising running back who could easily find his way into the endzone. Sure the Giants won the Super Bowl with Jacobs as one of the backs in 2011, but was he really worth the franchise tag and contract? The Giants had plenty of options at running back and didn\u2019t have to invest millions in running back who wasn\u2019t always on the field. Coming off a year where he was named the NFL\u2019s comeback player of the year and helped lead the Eagles to the playoffs, it seemed like a great decision to tag the quarterback and sign him long term. Unfortunately, Vick was only able to fly like an eagle for basically one season. The Eagles finished 8-8 in 2011 and Vick\u2019s touchdowns dropped while his interceptions went up. He\u2019d go on to start 10 games in 2012, but the Eagles went 3-7 in that time before he got hurt and Nick Foles finished the season. Vick had been out of the league for three years before he signed with the Eagles in 2009 serving time in jail for his part in a dog-fighting ring. The Eagles were too optimistic to believe he could have repeated his 2010 season where he threw 21 touchdowns and 3,018 yards. If last season is any indication of the Muhammad Wilkerson the Jets will have from here on out, it\u2019s fair to label him as one of the worst franchise tags."]
["amp/sports/football", "The Jets secured their big defensive lineman with a franchise tag and later rewarded him with a 5-year $86 million deal. Wilkerson was one of the best pass rushers in the game so the move made sense, until it didn\u2019t. Wilkerson rewarded the Jets for their faith in him by having one of his worst seasons as a pro. Despite playing in 15 of 16 games, the defensive tackle only had 4.5 sacks with 33 tackles in 2016. During his contract year, Wilkerson put up a career-high 12 sacks, but was unable to duplicate it. If he never returns to form, you can chalk this one up to a decision the Jets would take back with hindsight. Dolphins fans can\u2019t be happy with how Charles Clay\u2019s tag worked out in 2015. Tight ends are hard to come by in the NFL and it appeared Miami had a definite answer at the position. However, instead of placing a $8.3 million franchise tag on Clay, the Dolphins hoped to save money by giving him a transition tag priced just over $7 million. Because of the transition tag, the Bills were able to offer sheet Clay and he couldn\u2019t turn down a 5-year, $38 million contract with Buffalo. The Dolphins chose not to match and they had no answer at the position in 2016. However, they could possibly have an answer now after reportedly trading for Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas. Trades can\u2019t be official until March 9."]

["sports", "Cassius Clay is the King of the Ring as Sonny Liston unable to answer the bell in the 7th (Originally published by the Daily News on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 1964; written by Gene Ward) Miami Beach, Fla. - Turning his boastful words into a blazing assortment of punches, young Cassius Clay became the new heavyweight champion of the world in a scene of bedlam here tonight as a badly-beaten and bloodied Sonny Liston failed to answer the bell for the seventh round of the scheduled 15-round battle. The bell for round seven rang, but Liston's chief advisor, Jack Nilon, wig-wagged to referee Barney Felix that the heavily-favored champion had had it. Thus, one of the all-time great upsets was recorded by a 7-1 underdog, a 22-year-old with only 19 professional bouts, whom the whole mitt world had said didn't have a chance. One half hour after the bout, the Miami Beach Boxing Commission ordered Liston's purse held up pending examination by two surgeons in Miami Beach Wednesday. The announcement, made by Ed Lassman, a member of the Commission and the president of the World Boxing Association, affected only Liston's share of the live gate, not the huge revenue from theatre television. The Miami Beach City Council also announced it would investigate the bout. When the bout ended, Liston was slumped on his stool, a cut under his left eye drooling blood and the area under the right eye a lumpy purple blob. He just sat there with a stony look on his face as Nilon and his corner cut-man, Willie Reddish, explained to the referee that Liston had injured his left shoulder and was through for the evening."]
["sports", "\"WE THINK IT'S OUT of joint,\" Reddish explained to shouting newsmen at ringside. \"He hasn't been able to punch with his left.\" The defrocked champion's personal physician, Dr. Robert Bennett, who came to the corner after Nilon had made his decision to end the fight, said it appeared that Liston had injured a nerve or pulled a tendon. Later, Liston went to St. Francis of Assisi Hospital for an examination. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician of the Miami Beach Commission, came to ringside and told reporters that Liston felt something snap in his left shoulder in the first round. \"That's what he told me,\" Dr. Robbins said. \"The middle of the first round. He told me he couldn't raise his left arm after that.\" The first official medical bulletin came from Dr. Octavio Suarez, chief of the emergency ward at St. Francis Hospital, who examined Liston and said he had no feeling from the left side of his neck down to his left elbow. The fact is, of course, he did raise his left arm after that, and threw many hooks and jabs, the majority of which whistled harmlessly through the air. Clay seemed to be the first to sense that what he had been boasting all along would happened had, indeed, come to pass. He came leaping from his corner like a gazelle, prancing and dancing and whooping, followed by his dazed handlers, Angelo Dundee and Drew (Bundini) Brown."]
["sports", "Then his followers, who out-antic the Beatles' own addicts, came storming into the ring followed by a deluge of Convention Hall gendarmes. The fighters disappeared from view and chaos descended on the ring for a good 10 minutes before order was restored. THE CROWD of 8,297, paying $402,000 at the gate - far below expectations - was baffled by the sudden, anti-climactic ending. Clay, magnificent in the early rounds, had seemed to be running out of juice in the fifth, which was the first and only round won by Liston, at least on this ring-sider's scorecard. Then, suddenly, the fight was over and the Clay camp was going crazy. It wasn't until a good 15 to 18 minutes later than announcer Frank Freeman asked for the crowd's attention and told them about the injury to Liston. THE REACTION was a chorus of boos, indication that many in the house thought Liston quit cold. A fresh announcement from Liston's dressing room a half hour later stated that the defeated champion would have his shoulder X-rayed as soon as possible. Dr. Robert Bennett, his personal physician who had jumped into the ring just before Sonny bowed out, was with him. But no matter what the examination shows, nothing can detract from the magnificence of Clay's performance. Only 12 hours before, at the weigh-in in which he scaled 210 \u00bd to Liston's 218, his frenzied behavior had brought him a $2,500 fine and prompted the chief physician of the Miami Beach Commission, Dr. Alexander Robbins, to call him \"emotionally unbalanced\" and \"apt to crack up at any moment.\""]
["sports", "INSTEAD, IT WAS Liston who cracked - wide open. Circling left and right, making the slugger look foolish with his clumsy swinging, Clay breezed through the opening around. He filled Sonny's ugly, scowling face full of jabs and won it going away. At the end of that round he had Liston flinching and ducking. In fact, it wasn't until the round was over - both of them having fought after the bell - that Liston finally landed his right. In the second round, the one which Sonny had tabbed as the wind-up frame at weigh-in, the champion went all out for the kayo and got nowhere. Clay eased off on his torrid maneuvers of the opening stanza but Liston still couldn't nail him with a solid punch and it was an even round. He chased Clay continually, but never caught up with him. IN ROUND THREE, the Louisville Lip, who had entered the ring with a flamboyant jacket on which was emblazoned \"THE LIP\", was sensational. Here, in round three, Cassius had his greatest moments. He opened with two jabs to the face and suddenly the blood was spurting from a cut under the left eye on the rim of Liston's cheekbone. The ringsiders screamed as Clay went to work on the damaged eye. \"Close his other peeper, Cassius,\" shouted one of his seconds above the roar of the stunned crowd, which couldn't believe what it was seeing."]
["sports", "CLAY FOLLOWED with a left-right to the jaw and drove Liston to the ropes. Liston missed a hook and moved in to pummel Clay on the ribs until the challenger grabbed and held. Clay put over a left, then a left-right combination to the side of the head, and a new gush of blood streamed down the side of Liston's face. He appeared to hurt Clay in the final seconds with a right uppercut, but he was too late with too little. CUT-MAN REDDISH worked feverishly on the slice under Liston's left eye between rounds, but it was puffy as the fourth opened and drooling blood half way through the round. Liston couldn't seem to untrack himself in the fourth, but he won the fifth, a round in which Clay's seconds were complaining that a drug used on Liston's cut was getting into their man's eyes. Cassius did appear to be bothered for a time in the fifth and Liston took command. IN FACT, it appeared at this point that Clay had run completely out of bounce. He had stopped throwing his lightning jabs and was merely scrubbing his left in Liston's face. By now Sonny's eye had stopped bleeding and it looked as though he finally had found the groove. Clay held, then held some more, and caught a left hook on the side of the jaw just before the bell."]
["sports", "But it was Clay who was back on the beam in the sixth. He opened with a left jab, followed with a straight left, then put over a lead right. The crowd whooped. The area under Liston's right eye was getting puffy now and blood was spurting again from the cut beneath the left. HE LOOKED LIKE a tired old fighter as he moved back to his corner at the end of what was to be the final round of the fight. In that the bell actually sounded for the seventh, the seventh round becomes the official round of the knockout. It was Reddish who first tipped this ringsider that Liston was through for the evening when he turned toward referee Felix and gave an elaborate shrug. Then Nilon wig-wagged that it was over. SONNY'S PHYSICIAN, Dr. Bennett, climbed into the ring after Nilon had ended Liston's title defense and taped Sonny's shoulder. But all of this was hidden from the crowd by the swarm of handlers, police and just plain interlopers in the ring. It was the second defeat for Liston and his first by kayo, while the unconquered Clay, a former Olympic light-heavyweight champion, was running his pro skein to 20 straight and his knockout total to 16. ACCORDING TO  optimistic pre-fight estimates, Liston could earn a million dollars as his cut of the closed-circuit TV, the guaranteed $625,000 from Bill MacDonald's live promotion, and the various other ancillary money from movies, radio, etc."]

In a dramatic turn for a former top cop, retired Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca was due in a federal courtroom to plead guilty to a single felony charge of lying to investigators, prosecutors said. Baca, 73, falsely told investigators he had no idea his deputies planned to approach and threaten an FBI agent in 2011 because she was probing allegations of corruption and civil rights violations inside his former lockups, the U.S. attorney's office said. The plea deal calls for a maximum of six months behind bars, but the actual sentence will be determined by a federal judge, according to court filings obtained by the Daily News. LOS ANGELES COUNTY SETTLES CIVIL RIGHTS CASE WITH FEDS Under his plea agreement, Baca now admits he secretly directed deputies to \"isolate\" an inmate suspected of being an FBI informant and \"do everything but put handcuffs\" on the FBI agent sniffing around his jails. As a result, two deputies approached the agent outside her home on September 26, 2011, and threatened her with arrest, prosecutors said. Officials said it was during a 2013 meeting with the FBI and assistant U.S. attorneys that Baca denied any participation in the 2011 meetings."]

Wednesday\u2019s shock announcement came after Baca\u2019s former top aide, Paul Tanaka, was indicted last May for obstructing the federal probe. A month after Tanaka\u2019s indictment, three sheriff\u2019s deputies were convicted of beating a handcuffed jail visitor bloody and then fabricating a report to cover up the crime. The visitor, Gabriel Carrillo, was restrained and assaulted in February 2011 after deputies found him and his girlfriend illegally carrying cellphones while visiting Carrillo's brother at Men's Central Jail. Carrillo allegedly trash talked the deputies before the attack. The deputies claimed he initiated the violent encounter when he was un-cuffed for fingerprinting, but prosecutors said his injuries indicated both arms were shackled during the beatdown. \"Former Sheriff Lee Baca deserves punishment,\" George Hofstetter President of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs (ALADS), said in a statement Wednesday. \"The plea agreement sends a strong message that no one is above the law.

["", "Barneys accused me of stealing because I'm black: Teen - NY Daily News A black teenager is shopping for justice \u2014 claiming snooty Barneys staffers and New York City cops racially profiled him for credit card fraud after he bought a $349 belt. Trayon Christian, 19, told the Daily News he filed a lawsuit after he was targeted by staffers at Barneys\u2019 Madison Ave. flagship store and detained by police because they didn\u2019t believe a young black man could possibly afford to buy such an expensive belt. The fashion-forward teen, who lives with his mom in Corona, Queens, is studying engineering at the New York City College of Technology, where he had a work-study job. Christian said his paycheck had just been direct deposited into his Chase bank account, so he went straight to Barneys on the afternoon of April 29 to buy the pricey Ferragamo belt with a silver buckle and a reversible black and white strap. \u201cI knew exactly what I wanted,\u201d Christian said. He\u2019d seen the belt on a lot of his favorite celebrities, including rapper Juelz Santana. He said he\u2019d browsed the ritzy rags at Barneys before but had never bought anything at the store. \u201cIt was a quick trip. I gave them my debit card, I signed my name,\u201d he said. According to his lawsuit, the clerk asked Christian to show his ID, which he did. \u201cI showed my state ID,\u201d he told The News. The clerk didn\u2019t react as he signed for his purchase and left, he said."]
["", "But he got no more than a block from the store when two undercover NYPD detectives stopped him near E. 60th St., the lawsuit said. \u201cThey said my card wasn\u2019t real, it was fake. They said someone at Barneys called to report it,\u201d said Christian. The male detectives \u2014 whose names he never learned \u2014 asked to see ID and look in his bag, he said. They also asked him if he worked, and where. \u201cI showed them my school ID and my driver\u2019s license,\u201d said Christian, who was 18 when the incident allegedly occurred. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Why is this happening to me?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe detectives were asking me, \u2018How could you afford a belt like this? Where did you get this money from?\u2019\u201d he said. He was handcuffed and taken to the 19th Precinct stationhouse, he said. According to his lawsuit, he was detained in a holding cell for about two hours. He was then released with his debit card, his belt and an apology from the police, Christian said. A spokeswoman for the NYPD denied Christian was detained for two hours, saying he was brought into the precinct at 7:04 p.m. and was allowed to leave at 7:45 p.m. \u201cMr. Christian was held in police custody for approximately 42 minutes and as soon as we determined that the card was authentic, he was immediately released,\u201d said Inspector Kim Royster. He was never charged, according to his attorney."]
["", "\u201cI was nervous the whole time, but not really scared because I knew I had done nothing wrong,\u201d said the teen. After he got home, he got angry. \u201cI brought the belt back to Barneys a few days later and returned it. I got my money back, I\u2019m not shopping there again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s racist.\u201d Calls to Barneys, which is led by CEO Mark Lee, were not returned. The city Law Department said it hadn\u2019t seen the court papers yet. \u201cWe are awaiting a formal copy of the lawsuit and will review the claims upon receipt,\u201d said Elizabeth Thomas, a Law Department spokeswoman. The NYPD said it has gotten 53 grand larceny complaints this year for credit card fraud at Barneys\u2019 Madison Ave. store and has made more than 47 arrests. But it\u2019s unclear how many of those arrested were actually charged with a crime and how many were, like Christian, released. Plainclothes officers visit Barneys periodically because of problems with fraudulent use of cards, the NYPD said. Christian\u2019s attorney Michael Palillo said the teen, who now works at Target, has a clean record. \u201cHe\u2019s never been arrested. His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt,\u201d the lawyer said. The student\u2019s Facebook page shows pictures of a fashion-loving teen.

He\u2019s a good kid.\u201d The hardworking mother could find only one reason for her son to be singled out after he\u2019d shown ID to the Barneys staffer. \u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s an African-American,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.

["entertainment/tv", "'Sons of Anarchy' creator Kurt Sutter opens up about finale - NY Daily News All Kurt Sutter wants to say about the much-anticipated conclusion of his \"Sons of Anarchy\" series Tuesday night is that he hopes that's not the only part fans will remember. \"When I saw the finale of 'The Sopranos,' I initially wanted a little more,\" says Sutter. \"But in hindsight, respecting ('Sopranos' creator) David (Chase) as a storyteller, I understand what the job of that finale was. \"After all he'd done with the show, he didn't necessarily want the ending to be the focal point.\"\n\nRECAP: 'Sons of Anarchy' finale ends with a bang Sutter acknowledges that \"Sons of Anarchy\" (FX, 10 p.m.) faces some of the same challenges as \"The Sopranos,\" since its central characters are the same kind of dark antiheroes \u2014 people to whom viewers have become attached although they've done awful things that would make punishment appropriate and seemingly almost inevitable. Despite an inadvertent leak of some spoilers late last week, Sutter and the rest of the \"Sons\" team have generally kept the finale under wraps. Several key characters were killed in last week's penultimate episode, including Gemma Teller Morrow (Katey Sagal), Wayne Unser (Dayton Callie) and Juice (Theo Rossi). That leaves in the balance, primarily, the fate of Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the tortured, sometimes insightful and sometimes near-psychotic central chararacter, plus his key lieutenants and other people around them. The show had previously killed off several other major characters, including Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) and two of Jax's closest friends, Opie and Bobby."]
["entertainment/tv", "RELATED: 'Sons of Anarchy' cast was nervous about finale, says Jimmy Smits Sutter says he always intended for the ending to continue the primary theme of the show's seven seasons, which is family in a broad sense. \"It's been a show about family,\" Sutter says. \"It will be about family at the end.\" That concept has always had starkly ragged edges in \"Sons,\" and it's not likely to change at the end. Several episodes ago, Jax pointedly contrasted \"the family I was born into,\" which he loves despite its dysfunction, and \"the family I chose,\" which is the motorcycle club. If that suggests there won't be one clear, neatly defined ending here, Sutter seems to acknowledge that's the case. \"Whenever you come out of any show,\" he says, \"whether it's television or movies, you don't want to come away feeling everything has been explicitly defined. You should be allowed to have your own interpretation.\" Sutter cites his previous show, \"The Shield,\" in which Michael Chiklis's disgraced cop character finishes his last scene by tucking a gun into his belt and walking out the door. \"We wanted to end it,\" says Sutter, \"in a way where you can form your own idea of what happens to this guy now.\" With \"Sons,\" Sutter says it's important for viewers to remember Jax's whole arc. \"I loved the idea of his seeing everything that Clay did wrong in running the club,\" says Sutter. \"That set him up to say, 'I'll do it differently,' and then he gets that chance. He gets to be different from Clay. But that doesn't mean he necessarily will.\""]
["entertainment/tv", "For much of the show, Sutter notes, Jax was \"reactive,\" responding to situations he had inherited. For the seventh and final season, all that changed. Driven to near-madness by the murder of his wife Tara (Maggie Siff) at the end of the sixth season, Jax set out on a course of pure vengeance. That he went for all the wrong targets, based on a lie by which Gemma hoped to hide her own guilt, compounded the problem. It set up a season-long series of killings and tragedies that will presumably climax in the finale. \"This year, everything for Jax has been personal,\" says Sutter. \"It's the first time it's been personal just to him. Only his family and his children matter now.\" Going into the final episode, Jax is a combination of the gambler who still thinks he can draw the inside straight and a saddened warrior who senses on some level that all the blood may have spilled in vain. Fans of the show have sometimes tagged it \"Hamlet on Harleys,\" and Sutter readily admits Shakespeare is a great resource to have available for tapping. \"I play with different Shakespearian themes,\" he says. \"At the end of last season I ripped off 'Romeo and Juliet,' with all that f----d-up irony. \"But it's not just one thing. It's more like a lot of little chips all along. You have different people in different acts, and you try to tie things up.\" He did, he says, think the seventh season was the place to wrap up the story."]
["entertainment/tv", "\"I do think it's time,\" he says. \"And I wanted to go into the last season knowing it was the end, that I didn't have to be wondering about a next season. \"I've had a general idea all along where I wanted it to go. But I didn't go into the last season knowing the specific final moment. You can't know that until you know where everyone has gotten to.\""]

Twenty-two percent of the 741,000 Louisville residents are black, but in the 147 cases that Judge Stevens tried, in two instances, the randomly selected jury pool came back with 41 of 42 potential jurors as white. In each of those cases, defense attorneys made a motion to Judge Stevens to strike the jury panel and to bring a new one since it was unfair for the African-American defendants to be denied a true jury of their peers. Judge Stevens sustained each of those two motions. JUDGE AGAINST WHITE JURIES IN HOT WATER OVER FACEBOOK POSTS\u00a0"]
["amp/news/national", "In one case, the new jury was formed, it was still overwhelmingly white but had moderate diversity, and it still found the man guilty. He is currently incarcerated. In another case, and this one is at the center of today's controversy, Judge Stevens sustained the motion to strike a jury panel with 41 of potential 42 jurors coming back as white. Like in the previous case, defense attorneys believed their defendant, a black man, deserved a pool of jurors more representative of Louisville. Judge Stevens sustained the motion, the jury panel was struck, and a new one was formed. This time, out of 42 potential jurors, four were black. Mind you, for it to be truly representative of Louisville, nine jurors would need to come back as black. Judge Stevens and the attorneys accepted this new panel. The final jury was still majority white, but the man was found not guilty. This clearly infuriated the primary prosecutor of Louisville, called the Commonwealth's Attorney, Thomas Wine. Wine motioned to the State Supreme Court to have Judge Stevens removed from the bench and recused from all criminal cases on the basis that the current system of selecting jurors is legal and that Judge Stevens does not have the right to strike an all-white jury down if it was legally formed."]
["amp/news/national", "Wine's office claims that Stevens has disqualified himself to fairly judge by writing about the contentious issue in a series of posts on Facebook. Judge Stevens, and his legal advisors, feel very strongly that this case has nothing to do with what he has posted on social media, but everything to do with a combination of race, racism, and his willingness to strike those juries. In an interview with the New York Daily News, prominent Louisville defense attorney Aubrey Williams, a black man, stated emphatically that he believes race and racism were at play in the move to have Judge Stevens recused. \"A few years ago white people here were talking about how Judge Stevens could one day be a Supreme Court Justice. Whites here in Louisville used to talk about how I could be mayor. What Judge Stevens and I both found out, the hard way, was that if we ever made a decision that honored the reality of our blackness, hellfire and brimstone is liable to come down. This isn't just about this case. He's a judge, his wife is a doctor, they live in a multi-million dollar home, and people around here aren't used to black people in power, with wealth, making decisions on their own.\" Louisville City Councilwoman Jessica Green, one of six black representatives on a 26-member council, echoed these sentiments. She served as a prosecutor in the Commonwealth Attorney's office for years and sees both race and racism at play."]
["amp/news/national", "\"I tried 52 cases in Kentucky,\" Green said. \"Not once did we even have four black jurors in a case. The more established I got as a prosecutor, other attorneys began openly communicating how badly they wanted black jurors off of panels. This isn't a secret. Any honest former prosecutor will tell you they've seen this around here. While most prosecutors are fair, many seek to unfairly remove black jurors.\" What we are getting down to here is what it truly means for a defendant to have their constitutionally granted \"jury of your peers.\" Consistently, for white defendants, this means a jury that is either exclusively white or close to it. For African-Americans, it means something altogether different. Are we really pretending that race and culture have zero implications with how people see the world? Consistently, time and time again, studies show that race, and corresponding culture, impact how juries perform. Of course, people don't see the world differently because they have a certain skin down. That's dumb. But what we absolutely have to admit is that when you are black in America, your lived experiences and life lessons shape you in serious, measurable ways. As I look at this case, and evaluate Judge Stevens, he makes me proud. He wants every defendant who comes before his bench to have a fair trial and he is absolutely right to strike all-white juries down in the name of fairness."]

In each of those cases, defense attorneys made a motion to Judge Stevens to strike the jury panel and to bring a new one since it was unfair for the African-American defendants to be denied a true jury of their peers. Judge Stevens sustained each of those two motions."]
["amp/news/national", "JUDGE AGAINST WHITE JURIES IN HOT WATER OVER FACEBOOK POSTS\u00a0 In one case, the new jury was formed, it was still overwhelmingly white but had moderate diversity, and it still found the man guilty. He is currently incarcerated. In another case, and this one is at the center of today's controversy, Judge Stevens sustained the motion to strike a jury panel with 41 of potential 42 jurors coming back as white. Like in the previous case, defense attorneys believed their defendant, a black man, deserved a pool of jurors more representative of Louisville. Judge Stevens sustained the motion, the jury panel was struck, and a new one was formed. This time, out of 42 potential jurors, four were black. Mind you, for it to be truly representative of Louisville, nine jurors would need to come back as black. Judge Stevens and the attorneys accepted this new panel. The final jury was still majority white, but the man was found not guilty. This clearly infuriated the primary prosecutor of Louisville, called the Commonwealth's Attorney, Thomas Wine. Wine motioned to the State Supreme Court to have Judge Stevens removed from the bench and recused from all criminal cases on the basis that the current system of selecting jurors is legal and that Judge Stevens does not have the right to strike an all-white jury down if it was legally formed."]
["amp/news/national", "Wine's office claims that Stevens has disqualified himself to fairly judge by writing about the contentious issue in a series of posts on Facebook. Judge Stevens, and his legal advisors, feel very strongly that this case has nothing to do with what he has posted on social media, but everything to do with a combination of race, racism, and his willingness to strike those juries. In an interview with the New York Daily News, prominent Louisville defense attorney Aubrey Williams, a black man, stated emphatically that he believes race and racism were at play in the move to have Judge Stevens recused. \"A few years ago white people here were talking about how Judge Stevens could one day be a Supreme Court Justice. Whites here in Louisville used to talk about how I could be mayor. What Judge Stevens and I both found out, the hard way, was that if we ever made a decision that honored the reality of our blackness, hellfire and brimstone is liable to come down. This isn't just about this case. He's a judge, his wife is a doctor, they live in a multi-million dollar home, and people around here aren't used to black people in power, with wealth, making decisions on their own.\" Louisville City Councilwoman Jessica Green, one of six black representatives on a 26-member council, echoed these sentiments. She served as a prosecutor in the Commonwealth Attorney's office for years and sees both race and racism at play."]
["amp/news/national", "\"I tried 52 cases in Kentucky,\" Green said. \"Not once did we even have four black jurors in a case. The more established I got as a prosecutor, other attorneys began openly communicating how badly they wanted black jurors off of panels. This isn't a secret. Any honest former prosecutor will tell you they've seen this around here. While most prosecutors are fair, many seek to unfairly remove black jurors.\" What we are getting down to here is what it truly means for a defendant to have their constitutionally granted \"jury of your peers.\" Consistently, for white defendants, this means a jury that is either exclusively white or close to it. For African-Americans, it means something altogether different. Are we really pretending that race and culture have zero implications with how people see the world? Consistently, time and time again, studies show that race, and corresponding culture, impact how juries perform. Of course, people don't see the world differently because they have a certain skin down. That's dumb. But what we absolutely have to admit is that when you are black in America, your lived experiences and life lessons shape you in serious, measurable ways. As I look at this case, and evaluate Judge Stevens, he makes me proud. He wants every defendant who comes before his bench to have a fair trial and he is absolutely right to strike all-white juries down in the name of fairness."]
["amp/news/national", "African-American defendants deserve true juries of their peers that are, at the very least, racially representative of the city. He's not soft on crime and he's certainly not soft on African-Americans out of some hidden racial loyalty. This, though, should not mean that he is forced to ignore the reality of racism and the continued role race plays in America. That's preposterous."]

The brutal murder of Kit Harrington's character Jon Snow at the end of season five upset many fans, but it sent others into a full-blown rage. \"Game of Thrones\" actor Brenock O'Connor, who plays Olly - essentially the Brutus to Snow's Caesar - on the show, received death threats after the murder played out on televisions worldwide. Olly, who joins the Night's Watch after his mother and father are murdered during a Wildling raid, resented Lord Commander Snow's efforts to team up with the people who butchered his family. Olly isn't alone in the efforts to kill Snow, though he does deliver the final blow, ultimately making him the perfect target for internet trolls. 'Game of Thrones' season premiere recap: The Red Lady reveals a weakness that could be critical for one popular character \"If you get people from Spain and Portugal and all over the world saying they are going to kill your family, you just can't take it to heart or you would not cope,\" the 16-year-old said in an interview with the Brighton Argus. Brenock told the British publication he finds the threats amusing - not scary. \"It's laughable how people think the show is realistic enough for them to send messages like this to someone who is not the character,\" he said. \"I find it quite funny.\""]

["sports/baseball/yankees", "Madden: Yankees closer becoming bigger issue than A-Rod - NY Daily News TAMPA \u2212 If you didn\u2019t know better, you might think there is only one player in Yankee camp this spring. Well, I am here to tell you that\u2019s just not the case. Whether you care to believe this or not \u2014 and you could never tell from his post-workout media sessions in which nine-tenths of the questions are about one person \u2014 Joe Girardi actually does have a whole lot of far more important issues to sort through this spring than whether Alex Rodriguez has enough \u2026um \u2026 juice left in his bat to win the job as the 25th player on the Yankee roster. Most specific among them is, who will be the closer \u2212 Dellin Betances or Andrew Miller or a combination of both? For now, Girardi is saying it will be an evolving process throughout the spring while he tries to get a better handle on the \u201cninth-inning psyches\u201d of both. And in that regard, there was probably no more welcome sight this spring \u2212 for all the parties involved \u2212 than the return of Mariano Rivera after a year\u2019s retirement sabbatical, to provide wise counsel to the two would-be closers and an additional pair of evaluating eyes for Girardi. \u201cI love this! I really enjoy this!\u201d Mo was saying when I came across him Monday standing next to another Yankee pitching wise man, El Duque, observing Masahiro Tanaka\u2019s early-morning throwing session. \u201cI needed to have last year off, but now I\u2019m here with the desire to help us. My visit here is to engage with everybody.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "So far, Rivera has been merely observing Betances and Miller as they\u2019ve gone through their bullpen sessions. Face-to-face talks will come, he said, but only if they ask him. Since neither of them has ever closed to any degree and are therefore mostly unfamiliar with the ninth inning, one must assume at some point in time they might want to engage Rivera on what it takes to make that progression. \u201cI would tell them, you must be prepared and ready mentally for anything,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThe ninth inning is very different. We make it tougher. But the most important thing is not to make it any tougher than it has to be.\u201d That, Rivera said, was the secret for him making the adjustment so seamless from John Wetteland\u2019s set-up man on the \u201996 Yankee championship team to the \u201cman\u201d for the next 17 seasons. \u201cI didn\u2019t put any extra pressure on myself. I didn\u2019t try to strike everybody out. My philosophy was to just keep it simple and throw a minimum of pitches. The less they saw of me, the better.\u201d Easy for him to say. But, in the lefty Miller particularly, Rivera sees the qualities that make for a successful closer. \u201cEarly in his career, he had trouble throwing strikes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these last couple of seasons, since he\u2019s been relieving, he throws strikes. He\u2019s become a strike machine. Betances can do the same thing. He maybe didn\u2019t get enough opportunities when he was first called up here. He has the arm and he just has to replicate his delivery."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "But what about the closer mindset? \u201cYou never know about that until you put them in that role.\u201d Which, believe it or not, is right there at the top \u2212 along with whether Didi Gregorius can handle the shortstop job \u2212 of Girardi\u2019s spring agenda. When I broached the manager on the subject, I got the feeling he would really like to have one closer, rather than a committee of two. But at this point, before the exhibition games have even begun, he\u2019s keeping an open mind. \u201cI\u2019m looking for guys to take charge and step up,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cBut the key to me is that they\u2019re prepared for when they\u2019re going to pitch, especially down here. In particular, I really need to get to know Miller, both as a pitcher and a person.\u201d He\u2019s got five weeks for that and, periodically, an extra observer in Rivera, who has to go back to New York next week to attend to his church in New Rochelle and then will return later in the spring. The good news for Girardi is that, as long as it takes for him to make his determination, no one is likely to start making this a closer controversy. Forgive him for wondering, however, why, as far as the media is concerned, his biggest issue this spring is the status of the 25th man. MOBILE USERS: CLICK HERE FOR YANKEES PODCAST"]

The grieving mother recalled her daughter's final phone call while driving to the Orange County Coroner's Office to claim Akyra's body. \"It was devastating,\" she said. Last Monday, Akyra Murray graduated third in her class of 42 students from West Catholic Preparatory High School, with plans to attend Mercyhurst University. Murray had recently signed a letter of intent for the Erie school, which offered a full scholarship to play basketball following a successful year in which she scored 1,000 points for the Lady Burrs. The family went to Florida expecting to visit Murray's brother in college. Murray said she wanted to go to Pulse \u2014 a gay club that allows clubbers as young as 18 to party \u2014 with her cousins and a friend identified as Patience Carter, 20. \"She doesn't drink, she just wanted to have a good time,\" Natalie Murray said. \"We dropped her off at 11:30 p.m.\""]
["news/national", "But just after 2 a.m., she and her husband received an alarming text message from their daughter that there had been a shooting and she needed a ride. She and her husband sped to the club from Kissimmee in the hopes of rescuing Murray, telling their crying daughter to stay calm and keep applying pressure to her arm as she hid in the bathroom stall for hours. They hung up to call police and never spoke to their daughter again. The family spent the next 27 hours searching hospitals and calling police for word of their daughter, but learned nothing until investigators confirmed she was among the dead. Police identified Murray in the final round of victims Monday afternoon. Murray's friend Carter was wounded in the attack and is expected to recover. She is a student at New York University and is an aspiring musician. With News Wire Services nhensley@nydailynews.com"]

["opinion", "Leniency for a traitor: Obama clemency for criminal leaker Manning is unjust With his 70,000th-hour commutation of the sentence of Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Army Private Bradley Manning, President Obama has granted leniency to a traitor. This is not justice. Megaleaker Manning deliberately exposed a vast trove of U.S. secrets, endangering Americans and setting back the national interest. Whether or not the 35-year term Manning was handed down in 2013 was correct, a mere seven years, a fifth of the sentence, is unjustifiably lenient. In 2009, Manning, an enlisted soldier and low-level intelligence analyst in Iraq, stole and handed off to WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of documents. These included: military incident logs from two wars; sensitive diplomatic cables from American embassies across the globe; intelligence assessments of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, and much more. Though no doubt some of the information \u2014 such as revelations about civilian deaths in Iraq likely being higher than official estimates, and video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad \u2014 educated the public, that is no excuse for rampant and indiscriminate violations of the duty to protect sensitive secrets, in a manner that informed battlefield enemies of American vulnerabilities. While Manning's lawyers claim that a 35-year term far exceeded what other convicted leakers got, Manning's offense was orders of magnitude worse in severity than the others, as was the diplomatic and national security damage done. A nation whose eyes have recently opened to the pernicious interference of WikiLeaks in an American election should now be especially sensitive to such crimes."]
["opinion", "Clearly, what tipped the scales of presidential sympathy in Manning's favor as Obama's term ran down was the unusual circumstances of locking up a self-identifying woman in a man's prison. Manning, seeking sex-reassignment surgery, is miserable there and has twice attempted suicide. No doubt prison is unpleasant whether one is straight or gay or transgender, and the Fort Leavenworth stockade is a maximum-security facility, not a country club. This is not to justify mistreatment. The Army had and has a responsibility to ensure the convict's confinement is not cruel, with reasonable sensitivity to Manning's gender dysphoria. Humane punishment is imperative. A get-of-out-jail-free card was the wrong answer."]
["news/national", "UVA frat Phi Kappa Psi files $25M lawsuit against Rolling Stone for debunked rape story\u00a0 RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The fraternity that was the focus of a debunked Rolling Stone article about a gang rape filed a $25 million lawsuit against the magazine Monday, saying the piece made the frat and its members \"the object of an avalanche of condemnation worldwide.\" The complaint, filed in Charlottesville Circuit Court, also names Sabrina Rubin Erdely as a defendant. It is the third filed in response to the November 2014 article entitled \"A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Struggle for Justice at UVA.\" Three individual fraternity members and recent graduates of the University of Virginia are suing for at least $225,000 each, and a university associate dean who claims she was portrayed as the \"chief villain\" is suing the magazine for more than $7.5 million. Rolling Stone spokeswoman Kathryn Brenner said the magazine has no comment on the lawsuit. The article described in chilling detail a student's account of being raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house in September 2012. It portrayed university officials as insensitive and unresponsive to the plight of the student, who was identified only as Jackie, and suggested that the attack was emblematic of a culture of sexual violence at the elite public university. The story horrified university leaders, sparked protests at the school and prompted a new round of national discussions about sexual assault on U.S. campuses."]
["news/national", "However, details in the lengthy narrative did not hold up under scrutiny by other media organizations. For example, Phi Kappa Psi did not host any social event at its house on the day of the alleged gang rape as the article claimed. Additional discrepancies led Rolling Stone to commission an examination by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which said in a blistering report that Rolling Stone failed at virtually every step, from the reporting by Erdely to an editing process that included high-ranking staffers. An investigation by Charlottesville police also found no evidence to back up Jackie's claims. Rolling Stone retracted the article, and the magazine's managing editor and Erdely both apologized. The fraternity said the damage was already done. \"These allegations did not concern harmless fraternity pranks,\" the fraternity said in the lawsuit. \"These were allegations of ritualized and criminal gang-rape that Rolling Stone knew were the predicates for annihilation of Phi Kappa Psi and widespread persecution of its members.\" The complaint alleges that the magazine set out to find a story of \"graphic and violent rape\" at an elite university and rejected other possible stories that were not sensational enough. \"Rolling Stone and Erdely had an agenda, and they were recklessly oblivious to the harm they would cause innocent victims in their ruthless pursuit of that agenda,\" the lawsuit said."]

Denying the existence of police brutality, at this point, would be like denying the existence of gravity or the sun or the moon. It's an obvious, inescapable fact of life in this country. It actually does affect all types of Americans, including white folk, but the data shows us that it disproportionately impacts three people groups - people of color (particularly African-Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos), the poor and homeless, and people battling through mental illness. If you happen to be black, poor and mentally ill, you live in a full-fledged danger zone in this country. We're at the point, though, where millions of us are ready for hardcore solutions. Since the brutal police killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. and Castile in suburban St. Paul, Minn. earlier this month, the one refrain that I hear over and over and over again is - \"what in the world do we do about this?\" Protests in Baton Rouge, NYC, St. Paul; DeRay McKesson arrested Starting on Monday, I am going to begin a 25-part series answering that very question. I've spent the past two years, almost to the day, searching and studying and debating the answers. What I've come to accept, and what I must first unpack here, is this."]
["amp/news/national", "Police brutality is complicated. The solutions are complicated. Bringing about substantive change on this issue is complicated. The opposition to progress on this issue is fierce. Our law enforcement and criminal justice system is not broken. It is hundreds of years old, its systems and structures are deeply engraved, and making moves that actually move the needle on police brutality will not be easy. I'm doing a 25-part series because the problem has so many nuances and layers that need unpacking that it will take me a full month to do so. For every weekday for the next five weeks, I will chug along here and do my best to identify the problem points and point us to practical, reasonable, achievable solutions. In the end, we will lay out the problems, but will have solutions and action steps for each one. Here's the thing - while police brutality is a national crisis, the problem and its solutions are as local as it gets. Think Flint. Federal oversight of the water programs there wasn't inconsequential, but the problem was deeply local in the city and with state government. Al Sharpton, Eric Garner\u2019s mom lead anti-police brutality march Police brutality is even more local than the Flint water crisis. Police departments, sheriff's offices, and district attorneys each play a major role in the issue and the federal government has very little power to be deeply influential on the issue. Executive orders, federal legislation and constitutional amendments are not impossibilities, but they are long shots at best."]

While the prospect of sweeping federal legislation is dreamy, I think we have a real opportunity at actually impacting the problem one district at a time with truly achievable actions. Even with a 25-part series, we won't cover it all. Other solutions will exist that I fail to mention. However, I am confident that with this plan, we could drastically reduce police brutality in this generation by well over 50%. Push up your sleeves and let's get to work.

If you happen to be black, poor and mentally ill, you live in a full-fledged danger zone in this country. We're at the point, though, where millions of us are ready for hardcore solutions. Since the brutal police killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. and Castile in suburban St. Paul, Minn. earlier this month, the one refrain that I hear over and over and over again is - \"what in the world do we do about this?\" Protests in Baton Rouge, NYC, St. Paul; DeRay McKesson arrested Starting on Monday, I am going to begin a 25-part series answering that very question. I've spent the past two years, almost to the day, searching and studying and debating the answers. What I've come to accept, and what I must first unpack here, is this. Police brutality is complicated. The solutions are complicated. Bringing about substantive change on this issue is complicated. The opposition to progress on this issue is fierce. Our law enforcement and criminal justice system is not broken. It is hundreds of years old, its systems and structures are deeply engraved, and making moves that actually move the needle on police brutality will not be easy."]
["amp/news/national", "I'm doing a 25-part series because the problem has so many nuances and layers that need unpacking that it will take me a full month to do so. For every weekday for the next five weeks, I will chug along here and do my best to identify the problem points and point us to practical, reasonable, achievable solutions. In the end, we will lay out the problems, but will have solutions and action steps for each one. Here's the thing - while police brutality is a national crisis, the problem and its solutions are as local as it gets. Think Flint. Federal oversight of the water programs there wasn't inconsequential, but the problem was deeply local in the city and with state government. Al Sharpton, Eric Garner\u2019s mom lead anti-police brutality march Police brutality is even more local than the Flint water crisis. Police departments, sheriff's offices, and district attorneys each play a major role in the issue and the federal government has very little power to be deeply influential on the issue. Executive orders, federal legislation and constitutional amendments are not impossibilities, but they are long shots at best. While some of the action must be federal, most of this series will be highly local and will require us to accept the reality that this country has nearly 20,000 police departments \u2014 with most of them marching to the beat of their own drummer. While the prospect of sweeping federal legislation is dreamy, I think we have a real opportunity at actually impacting the problem one district at a time with truly achievable actions."]

["news/politics", "Everything you need to know about the 2016 Iowa caucuses - NY Daily News The Republican and Democratic parties might take a huge step toward nominating their nominees during Monday's pivotal Iowa caucuses - but then again, if the latest polls are any indication, they might not. The Iowa caucuses are seen as the official kick-off to the primary election season - a months-long process during which each state will essentially get behind its preferred man or woman, culminating in the formal selection of a nominee at a summer convention. HATERS IN CHIEF:\u00a0FIND YOUR CANDIDATE BY WHAT THEY HATE This year's process, however, appears particularly arduous. With the caucuses just a day away, there is no overwhelming front-runner on either side in the Hawkeye State; a situation that could mean the nominating process would carry on far longer than usual for both parties. \"Betting on the caucuses, especially this year's contests, would be like divining chicken bones,\" explained Bradley Todd, a veteran GOP strategist and partner at Republican-leaning messaging firm OnMessage Inc. \"But you should always look for momentum at the end of this process and project it forward.\" Making that difficult, however, is the structure itself of the caucuses. How does it work? Unlike in primary and general elections, where people just go to their local polling precincts and fill out a ballot or pull a lever, caucusing Iowans must attend public meetings in schools, community centers, places of worship, libraries and coffee houses during the evening and partake in an hours-long process to choose their preferred candidate."]
["news/politics", "During the GOP caucuses, appointed representatives or supporters of each campaign get the chance to make one final pitch for their man or woman, before voters present for the event make their choice on a secret ballot, sometimes simply scribbling their preferred candidate's name on a scrap of paper. The process for the Democrats, on the other hand, is more complicated. Participants must immediately declare their preference for a candidate, although those who haven't decided can declare themselves as \"uncommitted.\" Support for a candidate is only considered \"viable,\" however, if it reaches 15% in that particular caucus. If a candidate doesn't reach that threshold, his or her supporters are given the chance, in a second round, to support another candidate who has passed 15%. Throwing a wrench into this year's Democratic caucuses, because of that rule, is former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who in many precincts may not reach the 15% threshold. As a result, his supporters will be forced to support either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, a second-choice phenomenon that makes the outcome particularly difficult to predict. Can Cruz trump Trump? Or will someone else entirely sneak by them both? By all accounts, the Republican race in Iowa appears to have winnowed to two candidates: Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls show Trump leading the race in the state, with the bombastic billionaire getting 30.4% support. Cruz comes in second with 24.2%, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, followed by 15.2% support."]
["news/politics", "TRUMP, CRUZ, RUBIO EXCHANGE FIRE AHEAD OF IOWA CAUCUSES But the polls haven't always been correct. In the days leading up to the 2012 Iowa caucuses, polls generally showed a split race between then Texas Rep. Ron Paul and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. In the end, it was former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won, sneaking by Romney with a razor-thin margin of victory. Many political insiders think Rubio could be that wild card candidate this year. \"Rubio has benefitted from momentum in newspaper endorsements, strong debate performances and voters buying his electability argument,\" GOP strategist Ellen Carmichael, who worked on Herman Cain's 2012 presidential campaign, told The News. The Florida senator has quietly received endorsements from a growing number of sitting and former senators, as well as from the Des Moines Register - the largest and most influential newspaper in Iowa. Despite that support, many, including Carmichael, continue to think Trump and Cruz will perform strongly -- with the trio possibly dividing the vote in three. \"The winners will be Cruz, Rubio and Trump, in that order, with a narrow margin between all three,\" she predicted. And the winner could depend heavily on who turns out their supporters better. \"On balance, Cruz has the best organization in the state,\" Carmichael said of Cruz, who is largely playing by the established \"Iowa rule book\" of relying heavily on volunteers and infrastructure."]
["news/politics", "With nearly 10,000 volunteers in the Hawkeye State alone and dozens of full-time staffers and precinct captains there, Cruz has the strongest on-the-ground operation in Iowa, a force that will, on caucus day, likely turn out thousands of voters to the caucuses physically - even by driving them, if necessary. Trump, on the other hand, has only 16-full-time Iowa staffers, and plans to use a strategy that relies heavily on turning out thousands of first-time caucus-goers. \"Trump is woefully unprepared for the caucuses by any meaningful metric organizationally. He's really short on precinct captains, which doesn't typically matter in GOP primary elections, but does in Iowa,\" Carmichael said. Specifically, Trump's campaign, which has drawn numerous barn-busting crowds of thousands of people, plans on encouraging many of these typically apolitical citizens to go out and support \"the Donald\" on caucus-day. But new Iowa GOP registrations are down from previous elections, data shows, \"and although caucus participants can register on-site, it's a big gap to make up, especially considering the argument that Trump's energizing a group that hasn't participated before,\" Carmichael explained. Whether his strategy will succeed or not will not be known until Tuesday morning. Tight race for Democrats, too The fate for the Democratic candidates isn't much clearer. While Hillary Clinton had remained the front-runner for months - and by all accounts, according to national polls, still is - progressive Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is crushing her in the critical early-voting state of New Hampshire and has pulled into a statistical dead heat with her in Iowa."]
["news/politics", "SURGING BERNIE SANDERS PREDICTS VICTORY IN IOWA CAUCUSES With his populist economic message emphasizing the reduction of income inequality, a higher minimum wage, universal healthcare and government-paid-for higher education, Sanders' has made serious inroads with progressive voters in the Hawkeye State. And those who go through the trouble of caucusing on the Democratic side tend be more progressive and more politically-motivated than the average Democratic voter, Carmichael said - which could mean that Sanders could perform even better than polls are predicting. In addition, Sanders stands a better chance of picking up O'Malley supporters who must make a second choice, she said. \"O'Malley has been pretty vocal about Clinton being out of touch with the progressive movement,\" she said, \"suggesting (his supporters) are more likely to back Sanders than Clinton.\" The latest RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Clinton leading Sanders 47.3% to 44.0%, with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley getting 4.4%. Some individual polls even have Sanders beating Clinton in Iowa. The Vermont senator appeared in recent days to revel in the anticipation. \"We are taking on the political establishment, we're taking on the economic establishment, the financial interest in this country, and we're taking on the corporate establishment. That is what is unique about this race,\" he said last week, before predicting victory. \"I think you're going to look at one of the biggest political upsets in the modern history of our country,\" he said Sunday. But Clinton has remained unfazed."]
["news/politics", "\"There is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side, and I know obviously so does Senator Sanders on his. We've got a big choice to make,\" she said last week. \"I feel good about where we are,\" she said, before suggesting that Sanders isn't qualified to be the leader of the free world. \"People look and they think, you know, 'Can we imagine this person to be president and commander-in-chief,'\" Clinton said. The state of Iowa is about to answer that question. No sure thing - Even with an Iowa victory For as much stock as has been put in the first-in-the-nation Hawkeye State voting contest, the results over the past several election cycles haven't held much sway in predicting the eventual nominee. For generations, the Iowa caucuses had been seen as a fairly accurate bellwether in who would be the eventual nominee. Over the past 10 elections, the winners of the Iowa caucuses went on to the be the nominee for their party in 1976 (Jimmy Carter for the Democrats), 1984 (Walter Mondale for the Democrats), 1996 (Bob Dole for the Republicans), 2000 (both George W. Bush for the Republicans and Al Gore for the Democrats), 2004 (John Kerry for the Democrats) and 2008 (Barack Obama for the Democrats). On the other hand, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Michael Dukakis, Mitt Romney and John McCain all went on to win their party's presidential nomination after losing the Iowa caucus."]
["news/politics", "And increasingly, the winner of the caucuses has not only experienced poor fortune in the race for the nomination, but has fallen into relative oblivion. DONALD TRUMP APPEALS TO EVANGELICALS WITH BIBLE IN HAND AHEAD OF IOWA CAUCUSES In 2008 for example, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee won the Republican caucuses, but didn't come close to winning the nomination. He has held several radio and television and talk show gigs since, and is polling under 2% in his current longshot campaign, but has largely remained irrelevant in national politics. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the winner of the 2012 Republican caucuses, too, hasn't had much good political fortune since his surprising razor-thin victory in the Hawkeye State. This is likely due, experts have said, to GOP candidates' overwhelmingly relying on the support of evangelical voters in the early-voting state. That reliably Republican voting bloc, while important, isn't necessarily representative of the \"typical\" GOP voter, which could skew how likely a candidate that performed well in Iowa could do nationally. So while either Trump or Cruz appear likely to win this year's contest on the GOP side, it's far from a sure thing that one of them will end up the nominee."]

Thanks to boatload of cash and a horrific, laughingstock of a division, he could be right. \"We lost a lot of close games,\" Reese said at the NFL Scouting Combine on Thursday. \"A couple snaps here and there\u2026 our season could have (gone) a different way, but it didn't. So, we have work to do obviously, but I think we're close enough to believe that we can compete for the NFC East. I don't think anybody's running away with it. I think the NFC East is a close division still. I think that we can put together a team that can challenge for that NFC East crown next year.\" The NFL East did, indeed, emit a stench last season like few other divisions, with only 9-7 Washington with a winning record. The Giants have about $60 million in salary cap space entering free agency, so Reese, who will be fighting for his job after escaping the ax this time around, will likely be aggressive to plug areas of need.

But the 6-foot-7, 282-pound AL MVP candidate met his match two innings later, and the Bombers fell to the Orioles 3-2 at the House of Horrors otherwise known as Camden Yards.

["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "Oakley fiasco reminds everyone that James Dolan is the worst - NY Daily News There are plenty of pro sports owners who are jerks. What did New York do to deserve the biggest one on the planet? Because James Dolan proved again this week how big of a jerk he is in the ongoing aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s ugly Charles Oakley incident. The Knicks owner hit a new low Friday when he savaged the character of Charles Oakley, one of the most popular players in franchise history, and banned Oakley from the Garden until he can get his alleged \u201cproblems\u201d under control. \u201cPeople need to sort of understand that, that he has a problem with anger. He\u2019s both physically and verbally abusive,\" Dolan said on ESPN Radio. \u201cHe may have a problem with alcohol, we don\u2019t know, but those behaviors, being physically and verbally abusive, those are personality problems.\u201d James Dolan fires MSG security chief amid Charles Oakley fallout If you think people dislike Dolan now, just wait. We live in an era of extreme disgust for those in power, from Donald Trump to Roger Goodell to Dolan. A defamation suitmay be in the works, but an all-out fan revoltis already unfolding. Oakley is now forbidden from entering the same building where sexual harasser Isiah Thomas runs the WNBA franchise. He\u2019s planned a press conference for next week and this fight seems far from over."]
["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "Oakley had no business putting his hands on security guards the other night and they had every right to throw him in jail for assault, but if we are to believe what Oakley says, that those guards asked him to leave the Knicks game for no reason, then that's a serious problem. Because if Charles Oakley can get dragged out of the Garden without cause, then what would happen to you? Oakley: James Dolan has spent years targeting me for harassment Statements by Garden employees painted an ugly picture of Oakley\u2019s behavior the other night, that he was cursing and being abusive, but video from the game showed Oakley was in his seat until he was approached by security guards. That\u2019s when he started shoving and all hell broke loose. Dolan said on the radio Friday that Oakley should have never made it to his seats. That\u2019s partly why he fired security chief Frank Benedetto, he said. So really, wasn\u2019t Oakley already banned from the building? And were those security guards just there to evict him? If, as Oakley claims, he wasn't being inappropriate or obnoxious in Dolan's vicinity, then what we saw on TV Wednesday was nothing short of a human rights violation as the Knicks used intimidation and physical force to remove a paying customer from the Garden simply because of a grudge between him and Dolan."]
["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "Think about that for a second. You can get forcibly removed from the Garden just because the owner doesn't like you? Dolan has a history of siccing Garden security on perceived enemies (News columnist Frank Isola\u00a0has been shadowed before) and on Wednesday, we saw it happen on live TV. SEE IT: Charles Oakley arrested after fighting in stands at MSG That's alarming on several levels. Scary, even. If Oakley's side of the story is true, then any ticket holder can find himself surrounded by a security force and, if Oakley's being truthful, anyone who walks in the Garden is subject to unprovoked physical removal. And you thought White House press briefings were a hostile environment. Of course, when all this was playing out during the first quarter of Wednesday's Knicks game, Dolan hid behind a wall of security, which tells you everything you need to know about the guy. Make no mistake: the Garden is Dolan's house, and if a fight breaks out in your home between your guys and someone you know five feet away from you, are you going to hide in the basement until cooler heads prevail? Dolan could have and should have de-escalated the situation. He's the boss, right? He could have called off the dogs, told everyone to chill out and back out of each other's faces. He did not. He hid. He cowered. His first instincts were fear and confusion. He seemed aloof during the whole thing, which is just galling."]
["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "Metta World Peace says Knicks fans are to blame for chaos  After Oakley was dragged out of the building, Dolan's PR machine generated the first petty statement about how Oakley needs to \u201cget some help.\u201d On Thursday they released a second statement calling Oakley\u2019s account of the incident \u201cpure fiction.\u201d If the Knicks are being truthful about Oakley being a menace from the moment he entered the building, if this doesn't all come down to a rich team owner being a massive jerk, it would be easy to prove. Might take five minutes. As part of the Garden's $1 billion transformation that was completed in 2013, the arena's fire and security systems were rebuilt by Tyco SimplexGrinnell. According to Tyco's website, \"our video management systems create a constantly-running record of events that you can access, review and analyze.\" There are few public places in post-9/11 New York not under 24-hour video surveillance anymore, and you'd be hard pressed to find a corner of the World's Most Famous Arena that's not constantly being watched.

James Dolan, rather than trying to calm the situation on Wednesday night, hid behind a wall of humanity. Charles Oakley has been pulled through the mud by the Garden since Wednesday night. There are plenty of pro sports owners who are jerks. What did New York do to deserve the biggest one on the planet? Because James Dolan proved again this week how big of a jerk he is in the ongoing aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s ugly Charles Oakley incident. The Knicks owner hit a new low Friday when he savaged the character of Charles Oakley, one of the most popular players in franchise history, and banned Oakley from the Garden until he can get his alleged \u201cproblems\u201d under control. \u201cPeople need to sort of understand that, that he has a problem with anger. He\u2019s both physically and verbally abusive,\" Dolan said on ESPN Radio. \u201cHe may have a problem with alcohol, we don\u2019t know, but those behaviors, being physically and verbally abusive, those are personality problems.\u201d"]
["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "James Dolan fires MSG security chief amid Charles Oakley fallout If you think people dislike Dolan now, just wait. We live in an era of extreme disgust for those in power, from Donald Trump to Roger Goodell to Dolan. A defamation suitmay be in the works, but an all-out fan revoltis already unfolding. Oakley is now forbidden from entering the same building where sexual harasser Isiah Thomas runs the WNBA franchise. He\u2019s planned a press conference for next week and this fight seems far from over. Oakley had no business putting his hands on security guards the other night and they had every right to throw him in jail for assault, but if we are to believe what Oakley says, that those guards asked him to leave the Knicks game for no reason, then that's a serious problem. Because if Charles Oakley can get dragged out of the Garden without cause, then what would happen to you? Oakley: James Dolan has spent years targeting me for harassment Statements by Garden employees painted an ugly picture of Oakley\u2019s behavior the other night, that he was cursing and being abusive, but video from the game showed Oakley was in his seat until he was approached by security guards. That\u2019s when he started shoving and all hell broke loose. Dolan said on the radio Friday that Oakley should have never made it to his seats. That\u2019s partly why he fired security chief Frank Benedetto, he said. So really, wasn\u2019t Oakley already banned from the building? And were those security guards just there to evict him?"]
["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "If, as Oakley claims, he wasn't being inappropriate or obnoxious in Dolan's vicinity, then what we saw on TV Wednesday was nothing short of a human rights violation as the Knicks used intimidation and physical force to remove a paying customer from the Garden simply because of a grudge between him and Dolan. Think about that for a second. You can get forcibly removed from the Garden just because the owner doesn't like you? Dolan has a history of siccing Garden security on perceived enemies (News columnist Frank Isola\u00a0has been shadowed before) and on Wednesday, we saw it happen on live TV. SEE IT: Charles Oakley arrested after fighting in stands at MSG That's alarming on several levels. Scary, even. If Oakley's side of the story is true, then any ticket holder can find himself surrounded by a security force and, if Oakley's being truthful, anyone who walks in the Garden is subject to unprovoked physical removal. And you thought White House press briefings were a hostile environment. Of course, when all this was playing out during the first quarter of Wednesday's Knicks game, Dolan hid behind a wall of security, which tells you everything you need to know about the guy. Make no mistake: the Garden is Dolan's house, and if a fight breaks out in your home between your guys and someone you know five feet away from you, are you going to hide in the basement until cooler heads prevail?"]
["amp/sports/basketball/knicks", "Dolan could have and should have de-escalated the situation. He's the boss, right? He could have called off the dogs, told everyone to chill out and back out of each other's faces. He did not. He hid. He cowered. His first instincts were fear and confusion. He seemed aloof during the whole thing, which is just galling. Metta World Peace says Knicks fans are to blame for chaos  After Oakley was dragged out of the building, Dolan's PR machine generated the first petty statement about how Oakley needs to \u201cget some help.\u201d On Thursday they released a second statement calling Oakley\u2019s account of the incident \u201cpure fiction.\u201d If the Knicks are being truthful about Oakley being a menace from the moment he entered the building, if this doesn't all come down to a rich team owner being a massive jerk, it would be easy to prove. Might take five minutes. As part of the Garden's $1 billion transformation that was completed in 2013, the arena's fire and security systems were rebuilt by Tyco SimplexGrinnell. According to Tyco's website, \"our video management systems create a constantly-running record of events that you can access, review and analyze.\" There are few public places in post-9/11 New York not under 24-hour video surveillance anymore, and you'd be hard pressed to find a corner of the World's Most Famous Arena that's not constantly being watched.

Many fans were clamoring for Torres to already reach the big leagues after a marvelous spring in which he hit .448 with nine extra-base hits, combined with Didi Gregorius getting injured. But Brian Cashman and the organization rightly decided Torres needed more seasoning and acclimation to playing in colder weather, having never played above A-ball.

["sports/basketball", "Can Magic Johnson do a better job turning around the Lakers than Phil Jackson has done with the Knicks?\u00a0 Jeanie Buss clearly believes in Magic, but enough to hand him the keys to the Lakers' kingdom? The team's co-owner \u2013 and Phil Jackson's ex \u2013 brought back L.A. legend Magic Johnson to the organization as an adviser last week, with his future role to be determined. The Hall of Famer made it perfectly clear on Thursday, however, what he hopes that role to be. \"Working to call the shots, because it only works that way,\" Johnson told USA Today on Thursday at the UCLA-Oregon hoops game at Pauley Pavilion. \"Right now I'm advising. I get that. But at the end of the day, then we all got to come together and somebody's got to say, 'I'm making the final call,' all right? And who's that going to be? \"So, we'll see what happens.\" Johnson, who put up $50 million for a 2.5 percent ownership stake of the Dodgers with Guggenheim Partners in 2012, could take over the Lakers' basketball operations from Jeanie's brother Jim, the team's executive vice president, alongside longtime GM Mitch Kupchak. The 16-time NBA champions are on the verge of missing the playoffs for a franchise-record fourth consecutive year. \"Look, Jim knows where we are, Jeanie knows where we are, as a franchise, and so some decisions have to be made,\" Johnson said. \"I may only be in this role for a short term, I may be here for a long time. We'll just have to wait and see what happens. I can't tell you that right now.\""]
["sports/basketball", "\"It's going to take time and we know that.\" When you think about it, it's amazing to realize how much time has elapsed since Johnson's bombshell HIV revelation in 1991, an era when such a diagnosis automatically felt like a death sentence. So I certainly wouldn't put it past Magic to take on a more active role in trying to rebuild the team he led to five titles and won three MVP awards as a revolutionary 6-foot-9 point guard of the \"Showtime\" Lakers from 1979-1991, with another 32 games in a brief comeback from his illness during 1995-96 season. The 1992 Dream Teamer formerly held a small ownership in the stake from his lifetime contract with late Lakers owner Jerry Buss, and he was listed as an honorary Executive VP with the franchise as recently as last season. \"Everyone knows my love for the Lakers,\" Magic said when the move was announced last week. \"Over the years, I have considered other management opportunities, however my devotion to the game and Los Angeles make the Lakers my first and only choice. \"I will do everything in my power to help return the Lakers to their rightful place among the elite teams of the NBA.\" Honestly, I'm not sure whether he can pull it off. Magic's longtime adversary, Larry Bird, has done a nice job through the years in a similar capacity in Indiana. Of course, Jackson's $60 million failure so far to revitalize the Knicks without any previous managerial experience shows that such an idea doesn't always pan out."]

["sports/basketball/knicks", "Knicks draft Frank Ntilikina with No. 8 overall pick in NBA Draft - NY Daily News Phil Jackson continued to push the European takeover of the Knicks, keeping his star Latvian on Thursday and drafting a Frenchman with the triangle in mind. After a frenzied couple of days surrounding Kristaps Porzingis trade talks, the team president stood pat and used his eighth pick on point guard Frank Ntilikina, who is considered a project at just 18 years old. Jackson glowed about Ntilikina\u2019s attributes but also tempered expectations. Ntilikina was in Brooklyn for the draft, but his arrival at the Knicks practice facility is delayed because he has to fly overseas for the French League final Friday with his club team. \u201cWe\u2019ll take whatever his advancement is as a player,\u201d said Jackson, who declined Thursday to elaborate on the nature of trade talks regarding Porzingis. \u201cIf he has to grow into that role and come off the bench and become a player who has to learn how to play the game, that\u2019s fine.\u201d  From war-torn Rwanda to Knicks, the journey of Frank Ntilikina  Jackson passed on North Carolina State\u2019s Dennis Smith Jr., considered one of the most athletic players in the draft with a recorded 48-inch vertical. He was taken a spot later by the Mavericks. Malik Monk was also a target who went 11th to the Kings."]
["sports/basketball/knicks", "But the Knicks scouted Ntilikina extensively overseas, more so than any other NBA team. He was their guy. And with the triangle as the focus of Jackson\u2019s draft workouts, it\u2019s no surprise Jackson took the better team player over the better individual talent. Ntilikina, with a 7-3 wing span, is a selfless table setter who is committed to defense. But he\u2019s completely unproven after averaging just 5.2 points in 18.3 minutes with Strasbourg last season. \u201c(Ntilikina) plays the role well. He\u2019s a good role player. I think he\u2019s a good fit for us,\u201d said Jackson, adding later, \u201cThe big thing we liked about him is he\u2019s got size. Our game is really about length and about activity. We have to have more of a defensive presence and I thought last year we started to play better defense even though it wasn\u2019t reflected in wins or points scored against. We had players that wanted to get up and be aggressive defensively and play hard and that\u2019s the context we want to carry onto this next year and this is a young man who fits that well.\u201d  Dick Vitale rips Knicks president Phil Jackson   The Knicks now have three young core players and all three are European \u2013 Porzingis (Latvia), Ntilikina (France) and Willy Hernangomez (Spain). They also have a Lithuanian (Mindaugas Kuzminskas) under contract. Jackson acknowledged he prefers the European development path over the isolation-heavy AAU and NCAA."]
["sports/basketball/knicks", "\u201cI\u2019ve think we\u2019ve downplayed what the quality of the game is out there (in Europe) a little bit. We\u2019ve overlooked it in the NBA,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd sometimes, it\u2019s the ability for players to grow up into a system of play that they adapt to as they grow up as young players. And fitting into that style. I think a lot of times in our college ball, it\u2019s about adapting to who the players are. And the games become more of a style of what can you do offensively and giving a lot of room to players just to play one-on-one or whatever ability they have. Whereas, a lot of European players are schooled into the system and how to fit into it.\u201d Still, Jackson flirted with dealing his star Euro on draft night, as chatter of Porzingis\u2019 relocation dominated the lead up to New York\u2019s pick.  Clear after draft that Carmelo Anthony doesn't fit Knicks' plans  Porzingis was on the trade table, with a glut of suitors and negotiations occurring separately with the Celtics and Suns. Jackson\u2019s asking price was \u201cthrough the roof,\u201d according to a source. In a proposal to the Celtics, as the Daily News reported, Jackson asked for the No. 3 overall pick, the Brooklyn pick next year that Boston owns, Jaylen Brown and Jae Crowder. Reportedly, the Suns also turned down Jackson\u2019s attempt to pry Devin Booker and their fourth pick. New York\u2019s goal was to land Kansas forward Josh Jackson, who ended up going fourth to Phoenix."]
["sports/basketball/knicks", "Since Porzingis remains on the roster \u2013 at least for now \u2013 there are bridges to rebuild and a new French point guard to integrate. The Knicks have not been in contact with their forward since he blew off his exit meeting in April. Since then, Jeff Hornacek revealed that a text message to Porzingis went unanswered. The Knicks did not renew the contract of Porzingis\u2019 favorite assistant, Josh Longstaff. A meeting between Jackson and Porzingis\u2019 older brother only reinforced the chasm that exists between both parties.  2017 NBA Draft: Analysis of every pick  More recently, Jackson\u2019s friend and media mouthpiece Charley Rosen wrote a scathing assessment of Porzingis while weighing the pros and cons of dealing the 21-year-old. Rosen, who similarly blasted Carmelo Anthony during the fallout with Jackson, described Porzingis as \u201cextremely susceptible to injuries.\u201d He added Porzingis \u201croutinely gets bullied at every turning,\u201d he\u2019s \u201crelatively ineffective when playing the low post\u201d and \u201chis general attitude is the most troubling.\u201d The Knicks now have a young starting guard to pair with Porzingis, Courtney Lee and Hernangomez. Carmelo Anthony\u2019s career timeline does not fit at all with this collection. They\u2019ll have a maximum of about $20 million in cap space this summer and their own free agents include Derrick Rose, Justin Holiday and Ron Baker. Despite drafting another point guard, Jackson said they could still re-sign Rose. \u201cHe\u2019s a different category,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re listening.\u201d \u00a0"]

The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which is chaired by Kobach and Vice President Mike Pence, asked all 50 states for extensive information last week on voters, including full names and addresses, political party registration and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. He claims that 20 states have agreed to comply with the request, while 16 are reviewing what information they can release.

The law states that before collecting information from the public, federal agencies must solicit public comments and received approval from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The request from the commission gives secretaries of state about two weeks to provide the voter data and other information, including any evidence of fraud and election-related crimes in their states.

There's one of her throwing up a wad of cash in the air and several different versions of her wearing sexy lingerie. The 700 emojis, which cost $1.99 on iTunes, are divided into categories, such as sex (condoms galore), cocktails, face (Chyna's different looks), accessories, clothing and even an LGBT section with plenty of rainbow colored emojis, same-sex handholding, and hearts. Chyna, who also included a rendering of her infamous mug shot from February public intoxication arrest, is slated to make \"a couple million\" from the app, TMZ reported."]

Before starting the tune, the country-pop star talked with Nickerson about the things she likes to do, such as playing with Play-Doh, and talking about Spider-Man, whom the boy met the day before. \"I didn't know you were coming,\" he told her at one point. \"That's because we wanted to surprise you,\" the 24-year-old singer said. After their chat, Swift offered to play his favorite song, whether it was one of hers or not. The little boy, currently receiving care at Boston Children's Hospital, left the choice up to her. Settling on the hit tune about ex-loves, Swift began strumming a mini guitar and joyfully danced with Nickerson, who couldn't contain his excitement. \"Yes! Yes! That song!\" he shouted over the music. The chart-topping songstress encouraged Nickerson throughout the song, saying, \"Perfect!\" as he sang. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO. "]

Multiple members of the ubiquitous Calabasas clan reprimanded the rapper over the phone Tuesday after a California judge issued a warrant for his arrest, TMZ reports. The famous family reportedly fears the hip-hop star's legal woes could damage their brand image, particularly if his girlfriend Kylie Jenner was in the car with him when he got stopped by police. The judge delivered the bench warrant to arrest Tyga on Tuesday after the \"Rack City\" rapper skipped out on a court hearing regarding his financial issues.  Judge issues warrant for Tyga's arrest after rapper skips court   Earlier this year, a Los Angeles judge ordered the 26-year-old to pay a $480,000 judgement to his former landlord after he allegedly missed a month rent, broke his lease early and left considerable damage at a Malibu mansion he rented in 2011. Tyga still hasn't paid the judgement, but he seemed to flaunt his wealth last week when he purchased Jenner a $200,000 Mercedes Maybach for her 19th birthday. The rapper reportedly missed the hearing because he's partying in Turks and Caicos to celebrate her birthday, but that wasn't a sufficient excuse for the rest of the Kardashians. In the phone calls, they reportedly lambasted him for being so irresponsible to blow off a court date.  Gifts Kylie could've gotten for the same price of her cars "]

["news/world", "Border security agencies, companies exploring ways to shore up national boundaries \u2014 including age-old use of sniffer dogs While President Donald Trump continues to push for a border wall at the United States' southern border with Mexico, the border security business continues to flourish. Thomas Tass, the chairman of Borderpol, told NBC News that, \"There were more borders and barriers built in the last 10 years than ever before.\" To be precise, around the world, there are at least 65 barriers, according to research from the University of Quebec as obtained by NBC. One way to safeguard these borders, outside of expensive (and perhaps knee-jerk) barrier construction, could be sniffer dogs, maritime surveillance, drone technology and \"smart\" fences, NBC News reports. But the debate becomes: a nation's outward appearance versus the policies it actually lays out and enforces. That is, nations want to keep terrorists out, but do not want to restrict the rights of travelers (and refugees). In many cases, to counter this dichotomous approach, agencies and security companies are employing some of the aforementioned technologies. The border technology firm MSA offers \"intelligent fences,\" ground sensors and high-tech security cameras to pick up any unwanted visitors, NBC writes. The company's European Operations Director Frank Doherty told NBC that it's a realistic possibility that these technologies get applied to European nations, not necessarily only Middle Eastern countries where the work predominates now. The operations director said, however, that Europeans don't quite wish to see bulky fortifications along their borders."]
["news/world", "\"In Europe they're more covert,\" Doherty told NBC News. \"They want to know the intruder is there but they don't necessarily want to show everybody that they're stopping them (from) coming in.\" A maritime approach to monitoring immigration could very well become the usage of unarmed drones, helicopters and patrol vessels to survey, for example, the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Another rather unexpected but dependable mainstay in border security is sniffer dogs \u2014 animals that can trace drugs, tobacco, or humans. Colin Singer, managing director of Wagtail UK, said, \"The dogs are still renowned as the best method of detecting a scene.\" With the prospect of globalization taking a hit \u2014 with fierce pushback from President Donald Trump and a referendum measure in the U.K. passed that will gradually remove the nation from the European Union, the next question becomes: how does country-to-country information sharing evolve? In some cases, it could mean more defined and robust data sharing from databases compiled by organizations like Interpol. Border agents can draw upon database information within seconds. And so, if \u2014 perhaps \u2014 expensive plane tickets are bought with cash, a red flag could be warranted, Atilla Freska, of Securiport, told NBC. Aside from database technology, though, some nations still choose to erect physical barriers. One such nation is Hungary, which placed a fence along its border with Serbia and Croatia in 2015. At that time, massive groups of migrants were crossing through to get to EU nations, NBC states."]
["news/world", "Hungary's Interior Ministry Deputy Secretary Matyas Hegyaljai told NBC that, \"We have an obligation to defend not only Hungary, but the European Union.\" The deputy secretary said the fence could come down if the scores of migrants entering the country lessen. However, on a more global level, the whole affair is complicated by the terrorist group ISIS, which has urged its fighters to enter Europe via refugee routes. This then puts in jeopardy the Schengen system, which allows travelers to pass freely between EU nations without a passport."]

Noah\u2019s suspension will carry over into next season by as many as the full 20 games, so Hernangomez is the frontrunner to be the starting center on opening night of the 2017-18 season. Even when Noah is available, Hernangomez is the better option. \u201c(Noah) got injured a couple weeks ago and I tried to use this change to start games and play hard and I think I have to take advantage of that,\u201d Hernangomez said. \u201cAnd next year, I would say I feel more ready from the beginning of the year, for sure.\u201d"]

["new-york", "More vics, perps cited in Horace Mann sex abuse scandal - NY Daily News There were 30 more victims, three times as many attackers and a deeper coverup of sex abuse at New York City\u2019s Horace Mann School than officials \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 ever revealed, according to an advocacy group of former alumni. And the rampant pedophilia began as far back as 1962 \u2014 adding nearly a decade of predatory horror on top of the scandal. Even more disturbing, the Horace Mann Action Coalition said it found more than 20 accounts from students or teachers reporting the abuse since the 1970s. The coalition said the early reporting of abuse by alleged victims and staff shows there was a clear effort to cover up the sickening behavior. \u201cI am certain there are more reports of abuse that went to Horace Mann,\u201d said Peter Brooks, a member of the action coalition who created a database of evidence. \u201cWe only know what we\u2019ve been told so far \u2014 there are definitely survivors who have not yet spoken out.\u201d The information stored in the database was derived from interviews and emails from alleged victims, and from secondhand accounts. The coalition turned the information over to the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office, though the alleged crimes occurred beyond the statute of limitations. Sixty-two students who attended classes inside Horace Mann\u2019s stately, ivy-covered buildings were abused and molested by as many as 22 staff members from the 1960s onward, the advocacy group found. There were 32 alleged victims who participated in mediation talks with the Bronx prep school this spring."]

Horace Mann alum Mark Finkel, who graduated in 1972, said a student told him that he saw Somary assaulting another boy. He named the student and a school official who was told about the incident in a \u201cvery graphic report.\u201d The school official \u201cpooh-poohed it and told [the boy] not to worry about such ridiculous stories,\u201d Finkel wrote on a survivors\u2019 blog. Nine other reports of abuse were filed that decade, according to the coalition\u2019s unofficial records \u2014 some with teachers, some with guidance counselors and some with school officials. The alumni group said it knows of four other reports in the 1980s, four in the 1990s \u2014 including a letter to administrators written in 1993 \u2014 and at least four in recent years as adults came forward to report assaults from their childhood. Tim Kosnoff, a Washington lawyer who specializes in childhood sexual abuse, said the scope of the abuse at Horace Mann was \u201cremarkable,\u201d especially since it was a school catering to the city\u2019s rich and powerful families."]

A Horace Mann spokesman said the school \u2014 which has adjusted its abuse reporting policies to make them among the strictest in the country \u2014 can\u2019t comment on the coalition\u2019s findings because of privacy regulations and terms of mediation settlements with some victims. \u201cWe are grateful to those who have had the courage to come forward, and encourage the Horace Mann Action Coalition and anyone else who has additional information to reach out to the appropriate authorities,\u201d the school said in a statement. gotis@nydailynews.com"]

The girls, ages 15 to 16, disappeared from their London homes Feb. 17 and boarded a flight to Istanbul. Authorities believe the girls could be on their way to join the Islamic State group. The case underlines fears that growing numbers of young women in Britain and Europe are lured by online propaganda to join extremists and become \"jihadi brides.\" Security officials say at least 500 Britons have traveled to Syria to fight with extremists, often via Turkey. Experts estimate about 50 are female. The three girls in the latest case have all been described as \"straight-A students\" from a highly regarded London school. The families of Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, have implored them to return home. \"They appear to have been induced to join a terrorist group that carries out the most hideous violence and believes girls should be married at nine and women should not leave the home,\" Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday. As officials continued searching for the teenagers, a top Turkish official complained that British officials waited three days before seeking help in the case, losing valuable time. Turkey's deputy prime minister said the girls arrived in Istanbul as tourists, and British authorities did not share enough information for Turkey to act quickly."]

The Metropolitan Police disputed that account, however, saying Tuesday that they notified the Turkish embassy in London a day after the girls went missing. Police from both countries are working together to investigate the case, the force added.

The former White House adviser, speaking to a large crowd at a California Republican National Convention banquet said the 43rd President \"embarrassed himself\" earlier in the week with his \"highfalutin\" speech denouncing the politics of the Trump era as well as the bigotry and conspiracy theories dampening the identity of America. \"There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush's,\" Bannon said during the dinnertime address. \"It was clear he didn't understand anything he was talking about. \"He has no earthly idea whether he's coming or going, just like it was when he was the President of the United States.\" The remarks, part of a larger speech rife with attacks on the Washington status quo, were prompted by comments Bush offered on Thursday. Without ever once mentioning the sitting President, Bush hinted at the controversies sparked by the Trump administration, including its response to the deadly white supremacist protest in Charlottesville. Bush quoted Martin Luther King Jr. in his speech, emphasizing that people should be judged based on their character and actions. \"This means that people from every race, religion, ethnicity can be full and equally American,\" Bush said. \"It means that bigotry and white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.\""]

Injustice is so heavy here in the United States that if I had written 10,000 articles I still would only be scratching the surface. On the average day, I get hundreds of original emails from people who've been wronged in some way or another and hope they can have their story told. When I first started telling these stories, I must admit that I was terribly naive. I had no idea how complex the justice system is. While I knew it was difficult to hold a corrupt or violent cop accountable for their actions, I simply didn't know the lengths police, prosecutors, politicians and even local media outlets will go to protect a violent officer from paying the price for their brutality. I've learned the hard way over these past two years that what should make sense rarely does when it comes to holding police accountable for their violent actions. Now I know. I've learned many lessons, but the essential one that is particularly timely today is about the initial statements police give to the local media after they kill someone."]
["news/national", "I don't believe them \u2014 ever. They are not based on an analysis of facts. They don't come after an investigation. They aren't released alongside body camera or dashcam footage.

Consistently, these initial statements provide us with horrible details about the victim and nearly no details about the officers involved \u2014 all but convicting the victim, and freeing the cop.  KING: Milwaukee riots really stem from years of injustice  On Wednesday night, police in Columbus, Ohio, shot and killed a 13-year-old boy named Tyre King, whom they claim was carrying a BB gun. They also claim King matched the description of a suspect in a armed robbery. Half of America hears those details and thinks \u2014 \"Oh my God, police killed a little boy with a BB gun.\" The other half hears those details and thinks \"Aim a gun at police and they should kill you.\" What I'm saying is \u2014 we don't know what happened. Did Tyre really point a BB gun at police? Why in the hell would anyone point a BB gun at police? If he had a BB gun, he almost certainly knew it was a BB gun. What did he expect to do with it? I just have doubts that this young man pointed or even brandished a toy at police. That generally doesn't make sense to me."]

In August 2014, Ohio police shot and killed John Crawford in a Walmart. An eyewitness called 911 and said that Crawford had a gun and was roaming the store and aiming it at people. That never happened. Security camera footage showed that Crawford never pointed a gun at anyone at all. That witness also lied and said he saw Crawford load the gun. That never happened. John Crawford had pulled a fake gun from a shelf, and simply leaned on it like a cane while he talked to his girlfriend on the phone. Crawford never broke a single law that day, but was shot and killed on contact by police.

Perhaps not knowing the entire incident was captured on a security camera nearby, the two officers on the scene told tale after tale about the shooting. When the footage was released and analyzed, it quickly proved that the officers lied about so many essential details. Police shot and killed Tamir just two seconds after making contact with him. In those two seconds, in which the windows to their police cruiser were up, police claimed they told Tamir to put his hands up multiple times, that he ignored them, and that he then reached toward his waist for a gun."]

After shooting him, police allowed him to bleed out on the ground for minutes on end without providing an ounce of comfort or aid to the kid. When Mike Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told an enormous lie about the shooting the following day.

Mike Brown ran half a football field away before he was shot and killed by Darren Wilson. That's nothing like what the chief of police described the next day. For months, people imagined a scene unfolding near Darren Wilson's SUV, but that's just not what happened. Witness after witness said Mike Brown ran for his life that day.

Melendez then claimed he found drugs on the man, and said he resisted arrest. Video footage appeared to show Melendez planting the drugs on the grandfather. Eventually, all charges were dropped against Floyd Dent, the traffic-stop subject, and Bill Melendez was arrested and charged with multiple felonies \u2014 including assault.

(AP) \u2014Stephen Curry hit two free throws in the final seconds to finish with 34 points, and the Golden State Warriors rallied from 16 points down in the second quarter to beat the Houston Rockets 110-106 on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. With the Rockets seemingly ready to rout the home team, the Warriors went to a smaller lineup and closed the first half on a 21-4 run.

The Warriors held off Houston in the final minute of the fourth. James Harden, the runner-up to Curry in the MVP voting, nearly brought the Rockets back after Dwight Howard departed with a left knee injury. Harden finished with 28 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists and four steals. Game 2 is Thursday night in Oakland. Harden, serenaded with chants of \"Over-rated!\" from Warriors fans, mixed in a series of step-back jumpers and driving layups to help Houston even the score at 95-all midway through the fourth.

Curry added six rebounds and five assists, and Green had 13 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists to boost the Warriors when they needed it most. Ariza scored 20 points and Josh Smith had 17 points and seven rebounds for Houston, which played without Howard for most of the fourth. The center's status moving forward is unclear. In the conference finals for the first time since 1976, the Warriors hardly looked like the league's top-seeded team at the outset. Instead, the Rockets rode the momentum from a stunning 3-1 series comeback against the Los Angeles Clippers that ended with a Game 7 win in Houston on Sunday. The only setback to Houston's hot start came when Howard briefly left in the first quarter after colliding with Smith. Howard returned after a few minutes, and the Rockets raced out to a 49-33 lead midway through the second quarter that left the home crowd stunned and silent. That didn't last long. With Andrew Bogut in foul trouble and the Rockets rolling on both ends, the Warriors put Green \u2014 the runner-up for NBA Defensive Player of the Year \u2014 at center and spread the court with shooters.

["sports/baseball/yankees", "Cashman looks to change history with pitchers - NY Daily News The knock on Brian Cashman has always been about pitching. For every CC Sabathia the Yankee GM has brought to the Bronx, there have been too many Carl Pavanos, Kei Igawas, A.J. Burnetts, Jeff Weavers, Kevin Browns ... well, you know the history. So now, seemingly out of nowhere, Cashman looks to change his own history with pitchers on one stunning night of deals. After trying forever to talk the Mariners into trading Felix Hernandez, Cashman instead convinced them to give up Michael Pineda, the 6-foot-7, 98-mph throwing righthander with seemingly unlimited potential, for Jesus Montero. As tantalizing as Montero's show of Yankee Stadium power was in September when he finally arrived from the minors, this was a trade that Cashman had to make. In fact, considering how much more the Yankees need a No. 2 starter at the moment than another big bat, this just might turn out to be the best trade Cashman ever makes. For that to be the case, Pineda will have to live up to the potential he flashed as a rookie with the Mariners this past season, when he pitched well enough to make the All-Star team before fading in the second half. And Montero better turn out to be more of a DH than the next Mike Piazza."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "We'll see about all of that. But for the moment, it's not so much that Cashman pulled off a steal as it is that he pried away one of the best young pitchers in the game, which has become harder and harder to do in recent years as the price of pitching has become so exorbitant. And so the immediate reaction among major league scouts and executives was admiration for Cashman. \u201cIt's overwhelming to me that he could get that kid,\u201d one scout said, just hearing about the trade for the first time. \u201cI know Seattle\u2019s got a lot of young pitching, but there\u2019s young pitching and there's this kid. He\u2019s a monster.\u201d Yes, the 22-year old Pineda was the centerpiece, but there was more to Cashman\u2019s dealing. As part of the trade with the Mariners, the Yankees gave up Hector Noesi, a righthander Cashman has been touting for months, for Jose Campos, a 19-year-old power pitcher. More significantly, the Yankees also signed free agent Hiroki Kuroda, a solid No. 3-type starter, to a one-year deal. And so it appears that Cashman's patience this winter has paid off in a big way. He refused to overpay for the likes of C.J. Wilson or Mark Buehrle, refused to give in to Scott Boras and hand Edwin Jackson a multiyear deal, and now, in the middle of January, he has solved the Yankees' pitching issues in one night. Consider that the rotation now looks like this: Sabathia, Pineda, Kuroda, Ivan Nova and probably either Phil Hughes or A.J. Burnett."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "Indeed, acquiring not one but two such starters tells you just how unsure the Yankees are about Hughes, the one-time sure thing who mysteriously lost his fastball and struggled with arm weariness in 2011. And as for Burnett, well, remember Cashman's rant last season about all the criticism Burnett was getting? It looks as if\u00a0 the GM is finally smoking his own objective pipe in regard to the underachieving A.J., who still has two more years and $32 million on his contract. Of course, there isn't a team in baseball who wouldn't take Burnett as its No.5 starter. And that's what the arrival of Pineda and Kuroda do for the Yankees, turning their starting rotation from questionable to formidable. Not that it was easy to deal Montero. Still, it seems clear the Yankees, despite their denials, see him as more of a DH than a catcher. Just as it seems clear they're going to need to keep the DH spot open for Alex Rodriguez as his injuries mount and he heads toward 40. So it seems as if\u00a0 Cashman was biding his time all along, waiting for the chance to trade Montero. He nearly got Cliff Lee for him two years ago, and now he comes back to the Mariners to get Pineda. It\u2019s worth the risk for the Mariners, considering they desperately need offense and have plenty of highly regarded young pitching in their farm system."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "But it was a no-brainer for the Yankees, considering the pitching it will take to beat the Red Sox in the AL East, and likely the Rangers or Albert Pujols\u2019 Angels in the playoffs. You never know how these things turn out, but this is a trade that could go a long way toward rewriting Cashman\u2019s history with pitching deals."]

The Carolina Panthers' quarterback failed to fall on a crucial fumble and sulked through a press conference after the Panthers' loss, confirming what Newton's critics call his poor \"attitude.\" But what people \u2014 mostly white people \u2014 don't like about Newton is his style. Newton wears his emotions on his sleeve, his shoulder pads and everywhere else. His touchdown dances, his loud clothing and (except for Sunday's press conference) his loud mouth make him different from what white fans think many sports stars should be. And yes, that selective disapproval \u2014 there are plenty of loud, brash white players who never get criticized on these grounds \u2014 has a lot to do with race. If you think otherwise, I've got two words for you: Willie Mays. CAM BOLTS SUPER BOWL PRESSER AFTER HEARING HARRIS' COMMENT Mays has become an icon of baseball, the first black superstar of the sport. So it's easy to forget that many white fans loathed him for his bold moves on the base baths, his signature \"basket catches\" in the outfield, and the way his cap always seemed to fly off his head as he ran. Mays was derided as a \"hot dog\" and a \"showboat,\" who lacked the supposed stoic decorum of a proper ballplayer."]
["opinion", "Or consider Muhammad Ali, another sports deity who was despised earlier in his career. It wasn't just Ali's conversion to Islam or his opposition to the Vietnam War that rubbed millions of white people the wrong way. It was the exuberant, hyper-active style he exhibited in the ring. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee? Aren't boxers supposed to just stand there and punch away? In basketball, likewise, many early African-American stars were criticized for their excessively \"flashy\" moves. The game up until then had been a fairly staid affair, marked by screens and set shots. Blacks brought the alley-oop, the spin move, and a host of other innovations that somehow seemed too flamboyant, too out-there, too in-your-face. KING: SUPER BOWL 50 HIGHLIGHTS RACIAL DOUBLE STANDARD IN NFL Fearful of losing white audiences, the people in charge tried to placate them. When a young black seven-footer named Wilt Chamberlain started to dominate college basketball with his thunderous dunks, officials widened the lane so Chamberlain couldn't park there. They also banned offensive goaltending, so he couldn't swat the ball on the way down. And they prevented foul-shooters from crossing the free-throw line until their shots got to the basket, so Chamberlain couldn't follow up his misses with dunks. College hoops prohibited dunks altogether a few years after that, this time in response to another African-American seven-footer: Lew Alcindor, who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His smooth moves around the basket were unlike anything the sport had seen from someone so tall. So the rules were changed to try to rein him in."]
["opinion", "It didn't work, of course. Across our history, formerly \"black\" styles have often been integrated into the same sports that tried to exclude them. Boxers of every race now perform more like Ali than his early opponents did. And everyone dunks in basketball, whenever they get the chance. And, most importantly, players of both races mug for the camera. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has been doing his \"Championship Belt\" dance for a while, pretending to hoist a belt to celebrate a touchdown, and it has generated more laughter than hostility. When a white guy engages in these kinds of antics, it's goofy and amusing. But if a black athlete does it, it's \"selfish\" and threatening. Ditto for Newton's sullen act after last night's game. What's worse: walking out on a press conference or hurling profanities at reporters who are just trying to do their job? That's what Cardinals quarterback Derek Anderson did after a 2010 loss, and it barely made a blip on the media screen. Other white athletes and coaches have lost their tempers at press conferences over the years, and it's inevitably chalked up to their \"intensity.\" But if a black athlete pouts, like Newton did, we attribute it to immaturity. KING: BILL ROMANOWSKI CALLING CAM NEWTON 'BOY' WAS RACIST Let's be clear: this is about more than simply race. Each of the last four Super Bowls featured at least one quarterback who was African-American, and none of them generated the criticism that Cam Newton has."]
["opinion", "And that's because he draws attention to himself, in ways that the others didn't. There's just something about an outspoken black man that white America simply seems to have a hard time accepting. And when he refuses to speak at the appropriate time, as Newton did last night, we flay him for that as well. Is it too much to ask that we just let Newton be himself? Even when his behavior is snappish and petulant, as it was on Sunday night, I'd rather listen to him than to the scripted, cliche-spouting players who typically serve as \"spokesmen\" for pro football. Let's try hold our athletes to the same standards but not to the same style. We shouldn't judge Newton's behavior more harshly than other players who have acted in similar ways. But we also shouldn't insist that he tailor his exuberant personality to the drab norms of the rest of the sport.

The United Steelworkers union said earlier this week that the deal would save only about 800 jobs in total, including 730 union jobs, while 550 will still be lost through layoffs and attrition \u2014 lower figures than the 1,100 jobs figure that Carrier and Trump bragged about when they announced the deal."]

The union was left out of negotiations between the incoming Trump administration and Carrier.

Police records from the day a Ferguson police officer shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in a suburban street showed the incident panned out in less than 90 seconds, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The August shooting sparked three months of sometime violent protests and civil unrest in the St. Louis suburb. Activists have called for reform in the town\u2019s police force as a grand jury mulls over whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing. The jury\u2019s decision is expected soon. The records, obtained by the St. Louis newspaper, detail exactly what happened on Aug. 9. Before the shooting, at 11:47 a.m., Wilson responded to a call reporting a 2-month-old having problems breathing. He was back in service by noon. Two other cops were already searching for a suspected thief who swiped a box of Swisher cigars from a gas station \u2015 later, police would name Michael Brown as the thief. At 12:02 p.m., Wilson told dispatch he would help the two other cops in their search. Sources told the St. Louis paper that after Wilson tended to the baby but before he called in at 12:02 p.m., he spotted Brown walking in the street with a friend and asked them to set on the sidewalk. That was before he knew Brown was a suspect in the robbery."]
["amp/news/national", "When he called in and heard the suspect\u2019s description, he realized he had just seen the alleged thief and drove back to Brown and his friend. Wilson claimed the 18-year-old tried to grab his gun. He fired after the brief struggle, and hit Brown once, sending the teen running. Wilson said he called in after firing and said, \u2018Shots fired, send all cars,\u2019 but the channel changed on his radio during the clash and the call may not have been recorded. At 12:03 p.m. \u00a0\u2015 a minute after Wilson assigned himself to the case at 12:02 p.m. \u2015 a witness tweeted \u201cI JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE.\u201d A minute and thirty seconds after Wilson\u2019s original call, one of the police officers at the scene asked dispatch to send a supervisor to the scene. Cops asked for an ambulance at 12:05 p.m., two or three minutes after the shooting, but said someone had been Tased. Minutes later, at 12:07 p.m., one of the officers said, \u201cGet us several more units over here. There\u2019s gonna be a problem.\u201d Along with the calls, the newspaper obtained two videos from the day of the shooting: One showed Wilson leaving a local hospital after the attack and a second showed him arriving at a police station two hours later.

Brown was shot dead on August 9 2014 by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson The teen was fatally shot on Aug. 9. It took about a minute \u2015 and then rocked the city for three months. Police records from the day a Ferguson police officer shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in a suburban street showed the incident panned out in less than 90 seconds, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The August shooting sparked three months of sometime violent protests and civil unrest in the St. Louis suburb. Activists have called for reform in the town\u2019s police force as a grand jury mulls over whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing. The jury\u2019s decision is expected soon. The records, obtained by the St. Louis newspaper, detail exactly what happened on Aug. 9. Before the shooting, at 11:47 a.m., Wilson responded to a call reporting a 2-month-old having problems breathing. He was back in service by noon. Two other cops were already searching for a suspected thief who swiped a box of Swisher cigars from a gas station \u2015 later, police would name Michael Brown as the thief. At 12:02 p.m., Wilson told dispatch he would help the two other cops in their search."]
["amp/news/national", "Sources told the St. Louis paper that after Wilson tended to the baby but before he called in at 12:02 p.m., he spotted Brown walking in the street with a friend and asked them to set on the sidewalk. That was before he knew Brown was a suspect in the robbery. When he called in and heard the suspect\u2019s description, he realized he had just seen the alleged thief and drove back to Brown and his friend. Wilson claimed the 18-year-old tried to grab his gun. He fired after the brief struggle, and hit Brown once, sending the teen running. Wilson said he called in after firing and said, \u2018Shots fired, send all cars,\u2019 but the channel changed on his radio during the clash and the call may not have been recorded. At 12:03 p.m. \u00a0\u2015 a minute after Wilson assigned himself to the case at 12:02 p.m. \u2015 a witness tweeted \u201cI JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE.\u201d A minute and thirty seconds after Wilson\u2019s original call, one of the police officers at the scene asked dispatch to send a supervisor to the scene.

Minutes later, at 12:07 p.m., one of the officers said, \u201cGet us several more units over here. There\u2019s gonna be a problem.\u201d Along with the calls, the newspaper obtained two videos from the day of the shooting: One showed Wilson leaving a local hospital after the attack and a second showed him arriving at a police station two hours later."]

Donald McVinney, 66, who wrote a book about dependency and worked at Columbia's School of Social Work, was discovered sitting upright on his couch Tuesday, sources said. A 67-year-old male friend who went to check on him found him Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. McVinney lived alone in his W. 23rd St. apartment in Chelsea, cops said. The professor had dedicated his life to helping others overcome addiction and substance abuse and also teaching others about chemical dependency. Barry McVinney said his brother moved to the city from Westchester after he graduated high school and never left. \"He was a lifelong New Yorker,\" the brother said. \"Although he did travel extensively giving lectures and helping different social services all around the country and the world.\" Donald McVinney's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included stints as a director of training at Harlem United, a nonprofit. He was named \"Outstanding Professor of the Year\" at Columbia University School of Social Work in 1999. His research interests focused on chemical dependency, HIV/AIDS and gay and lesbian health. McVinney wrote the book \"Chemical Dependency Treatment: Innovative Group Approaches\" and received numerous accolades over the years for his work on treating alcoholism and substance abuse.

Salvador Dal\u00ed also worked with him, Barry McVinney said. \"I'm not sure if it was a painting or a photograph, but Dal\u00ed made him a subject,\" McVinney said.

He said he would be shocked if it turned out that alcohol was a factor in his brother's unexpected death. \"I hardly ever saw him have a social drink,\" McVinney said. \"I talked to him in the summer and he seemed to be in decent health.\" He said his brother's switch from art to social work was driven by a need for a paycheck \u2014 not a personal struggle to deal with addiction. \"My brother Don was never a drinker as far as I knew his whole life,\" said McVinney. \"If I were going to summarize his move to social work, I'd say he saw beauty in the works of people, and then that moved to see people as beautiful works.\""]

He destroyed all 9,000 younger candidates who ran against him \u2014 without getting out of breath. If you've ever been on a presidential campaign, you know it's months of 20-hour non-stop days and nights in every kind of weather, endless grueling speeches and appearances, no rest, and sleep just a memory of something you once did. It's enough to destroy a 25-year-old, let alone people in their 70s like Trump, Sanders and almost-there Hillary. Except for a brief bout with pneumonia \u2014 which probably would have killed a younger person \u2014 Hillary was always refreshed and on top of her game. Remember how Trump reduced 45-year-old Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who looked like they'd gone 12 rounds with the Klitschko brothers when he was done with them.

The Knicks (28-47) fell to the Heat (37-38), 105-88, officially eliminating them from the playoffs and improving their chances in the draft lottery by keeping pace with the Sixers for the fifth-worst record in the NBA. But after the defeat, which also officially eliminated the Knicks from the playoffs,\u00a0Anthony gave a puzzling answer when he was asked to define his role with the team. \"I don't know my role to be honest,\" Anthony, who scored nine points in 29 minutes, said. \"I'm just here to help those guys and keep those guys kind of positive and motivated.\" When asked to elaborate, Anthony said, \"At this point I think my role is to be there for those guys during this time. Help them along the way. In a game or in practice and in a lot of other ways just to be there for them.\" \"I don't think me going out there trying to score 30 or 40 every night, playing that way, is going to help them out,\" he continued. \"For them, I think at this point it's just getting the experience and letting them go out there and play and do that right now.\""]

Anthony was on the floor for the second straight night after sitting out two games on the Knicks' west coast trip. Before the game, head coach Jeff Hornacek said he was encouraged by the defensive effort of late, but the Knicks still allowed the Heat to score 105 points. \"The last three or four games we've played really good on defense,\" Hornacek said. before the game. \"We've had good stretches we just need to figure out a way to do it for 48 minutes.\""]

I think independent of what medium you're channeling that into, that's an incredibly important attribute. And Derek has that huge.\" During an appearance at Joe Torre's Safe at Home Foundation event last fall, Jeter said the Players' Tribune -- launched in October, 2014 -- was the venture among his many post-baseball pursuits that was taking up the majority of his retirement days.

["sports/baseball/yankees", "\"What is keeping me most busy? The Tribune, mostly. Trying to build that. It's been a learning experience.

We're gaining a little momentum.\" One of the most recent contributions to the site is a first-person account by CC Sabathia of his battle with alcoholism. Tull said another Players' Tribune essay that garnered praise was one by Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen detailing his experience with youth baseball. \"A lot of times people think athletes are one-dimensional. Guys have different interests and things that they like to talk about,\" Jeter said in November. \"I've always told (reporters) time and time again, I give you the same answers because you ask me the same questions. Here, we're giving athletes (a chance) to set their own agenda.\" FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE. As for the future of the site, Tull said his full trust lies with Jeter. \"This was a new medium, a new way for players to have a forum and that was really Derek's vision, to have a place and a platform where sports stars and personalities could directly communicate with their fans and the public,\" said Tull, who was a presenter at the Jackie Robinson Foundation awards dinner Monday, where he announced a $1 million donation to the Jackie Robinson Museum. \"Where that goes, morphs, sometimes it's hard to predict.

["sports/baseball/yankees", "Aaron Judge drawing Derek Jeter comparisons for on-field, off-field presence\u00a0 He has played in 50 games in the majors during his nascent baseball career, but Aaron Judge is already drawing the kind of praise reserved for people like retired Yankee captain Derek Jeter. In fact, Joe Girardi dropped a Jeter comparison Monday when asked who Judge reminds him of with the way the mammoth right-fielder carries himself. \"You know, he's a little bit like Derek to me. (Judge) has got a smile all the time. He loves to play the game. You always think that he's gonna do the right thing on the field and off the field. When you look at him, he's got a presence about him. He plays the game to win all the time and that's the most important thing. It's not about what you did that day,\" said Girardi, before the Bombers opened a three-game series with the Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. \"I understand that's a big comparison, but I remember Derek when he was young. He grew into that leadership role.\" But Judge downplayed the manager's praise after the Yankees lost, 7-1. \"There's only one Derek Jeter,\" said Judge, who was 1-for-4 with an RBI Monday, and is now batting .300. \"It's a great compliment. Honored to be in the same sentence, but I'm just trying to go out there and be the best Aaron Judge I can be.\""]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "Girardi was on the 1996 Yankees team that featured the rookie Jeter as the starting shortstop who helped lead the team to a World Series title. Jeter went on to win four more rings, collect 3,465 hits in his 20-year career in pinstripes, and be named the team captain by George Steinbrenner in 2003, among the scores of accolades and milestones that define the future Hall of Famer's legacy. Throughout that baseball stretch, Jeter comported himself well and managed to stay out of the tabloid headlines when it came to anything negative or scandalous. Even though Judge is just beginning his career, his quiet personality and humble nature are similar to Jeter's. He puts the team first. Of course, hitting the ball a mile doesn't hurt, either. John Flaherty, the former Yankees catcher who played three seasons with Jeter and who is now a YES analyst, said Girardi is dead-on with his Jeter-Judge comparison. \"Anytime I listen to (Judge) do an interview, he reminds me of Derek,\" said Flaherty. \"The kid seems to have his head on his shoulders the right way. He seems to say the right thing. It's about team first, it's not about him.\" But Flaherty said the real test will be how Judge handles the course of a grinding, 162-game season, when there are many \"peaks and valleys.\""]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "\"Everybody loves the long ball, right? And (Judge) hits 'em longer than anybody else, and harder. But I'm more impressed with the total package,\" said Flaherty. \"He plays great right field. He's got a strong, accurate throwing arm. It seems like he's a smart baserunner. The way he handles the media, handles himself in the clubhouse, it's the total package.\" The Judge praise took off Friday night, when veteran Matt Holliday, who had just beaten the Orioles with a walk-off home run in the 10th inning, called Judge \"probably the most gifted baseball player I've ever been around.\" Judge had socked two homers in that same game against Baltimore, and hit another over the weekend to increase his season total to 10. Flaherty said that when a player gets into a hitting groove, that goes a long way \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 toward boosting confidence. \"The bottom line is when you get off to a good start \u2013 I don't care if you're a veteran or a rookie \u2014 your confidence level goes through the roof. That's what we're seeing now,\" said Flaherty. \"It's a good stretch for him. It's an important stretch because he knows he can be this type of a player. Now the key is maintaining it when you hit some tough times.\"Jeter had his regular-season slumps, but shined brightest and was clutch when it counted the most \u2013 in October. The Yankees have to get to the postseason first, but the 2017 team has a budding rookie who seems to be able to carry it on his shoulders for the long haul."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "\"Derek loved to have fun, and loved to laugh, and loved to play the game, and always had a smile on his face, and was energetic,\" said Girardi. \"That's what I see from this kid.

The case involved alleged inappropriate touching of two victims by Sandusky as they were showering.

Gricar, twice divorced, had served as district attorney for 20 years before his disappearance in 2005. With the Sandusky matter continuing to unfold, Weaver said he was not surprised that connections between the Sandusky matter and Gricar\u2019s disappearance had hatched. Gricar\u2019s older brother, Roy, drowned in Ohio nearly a decade before Ray Gricar\u2019s disappearance. Roy Gricar\u2019s body was recovered and his death was ruled a suicide. The attorney who represented the Gricar family during the legal process told The News there were no signs that Ray Gricar was suicidal. \u201cHe was a very well-respected attorney at the peak of his career,\u201d said Amos Goodall. \u201cI knew Ray for 25 years. He was planning on retiring. He was happy, healthy, in a good relationship.

Just 42% of U.S. voters said they approve of Trump's job as President, while 50% say they disapprove, the latest Politico/Morning Consult Poll found. That approval rating is the lowest mark yet in any Politico/Morning Consult poll since Trump took office. The poll, administered May 12-14 among 2,001 registered voters, is one of the first major surveys since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week \u2014 and it found that the controversial termination was deeply unpopular. Only 35% of voters said they found Trump's abrupt termination of Comey \"appropriate,\" while 42% said they felt it was \"inappropriate.\" Meanwhile, another poll out Tuesday night found that more voters want Trump impeached than do not. The latest Public Policy Polling survey found that nearly half (48%) of Americans supported impeachment proceedings for Trump, while just 41% said they would not support them. That poll, like the first, was taken May 12-14, among 692 registered voters, before news emerged that Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russian diplomats and before news broke that Trump explicitly asked Comey to end the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn before firing the now ex-FBI chief. Those developments have led to lawmakers openly discussing impeachment proceedings, and are all but certain to increase even further the number of voters who support the option."]

["news/politics", "President-elect Donald Trump intends to pare back top U.S. spy agencies: report\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump, a fierce critic of the U.S. intelligence community, is reportedly working on scaling back two of the country's largest spy agencies because he believes they have become \"completely politicized,\" people familiar with the plan have revealed. Multiple sources close to the Trump transition team told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday that the President-elect is of the opinion that both the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency have become too politically vested. \"The view from the Trump team is the intelligence world has become completely politicized. They all need to be slimmed down,\" one source who spoke on condition of anonymity told the paper. The DNI, which oversees the entire intelligence community, would face \"restructuring\" under the plan while the CIA would see staff cuts at its Virginia headquarters, the source added. A spokeswoman for Trump would not return a request for comment from the Daily News Wednesday evening on how the supposed restructuring would play out. News of the plan comes as the President-elect is doubling down on his distrust of the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia stole emails from Democratic groups and individuals and handed them over to WikiLeaks in a direct effort to help Trump win the White House. Trump signaled in a tweet earlier Wednesday that he took WikiLeaks editor in chief Julian Assange by his word when he told Fox News the day before that Russia was not the source of the anti-secrecy site's massive email leak, which caused repeated embarrassments for Hillary Clinton during the campaign season."]
["news/politics", "Julian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! \"Julian Assange said a '14-year-old could have hacked Podesta' \u2014 why was DNC so careless?\" Trump tweeted, referring to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, who had thousands of email stolen by hackers. \"Also said Russians did not give him the info!\" the President-elect added in an apparent embrace of the Kremlin's repeated denials of the hacking allegations. Trump has been rebuked by both Democrats and Republicans for repeatedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, refusing to accept the intelligence community's conclusion on the election hacks, and now for embracing Assange. \"I don't believe any American should give a whole lot of credibility to anything Julian Assange says,\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted Wednesday. \"Assange has a record of undermining the United States. He's no friend to America or democracy.\" In an ironic twist, Trump in 2010 said the people behind WikiLeaks should be punished with \"the death penalty or something\" after the anti-secrecy site published hundreds of thousands of classified military documents leaked by U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning, who is currently in prison for violating the Espionage Act. Republicans have previously tried to pare back the DNI, which was founded in the wake of 9/11 to boost counterterrorism, nuclear proliferation and counterintelligence efforts. But such attempts have proven difficult as the office is responsible for overseeing core national security operations."]
["news/politics", "California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence panel, said Wednesday that he believes dismantling the DNI could lead to dire national security consequences. \"When Trump belittles the Intelligence Community, he impairs our national security and prospects for the success of his own Administration,\" Schiff tweeted. \"That Trump would accept self-serving denials of Kremlin is alarming enough. Citing Assange takes him into new & more treacherous territory.\""]
["news/politics", "Over 20 people call for criminal investigation into Attorney General Jeff Sessions over Russia remarks\u00a0 Almost two dozen people from across the country claim Attorney General Jeff Sessions should be criminally investigated for lying under oath about his communications with Russian officials, according to a lawsuit filed with the Department of Justice on Monday. The suit, which lists 23 residents from California, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont, argue that Sessions got off easy after it became clear earlier this month that he gave misleading testimony during his confirmation hearing. \"I want to see them treat him the same way that any other American would be treated,\" J. Whitefield Larrabee, a Massachusetts attorney representing the plaintiffs, told the Daily News on Monday night. \"I don't think he should be given the benefit of the doubt anymore and if he wants to present his defenses, he can present them to a jury.\" The plaintiffs, who are of various ages, genders and ethnicities, are described in the suit as citizens \"dedicated to upholding the principles of liberal democracy, equality, and justice.\" Sessions was embroiled in controversy after the Washington Post reported earlier this month that he had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on at least two occasions during the campaign. That revelation directly contradicted what Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 10. \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians,\" Sessions responded when Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked what he would do as attorney general if \"anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign\" communicated extensively with the Russians."]
["news/politics", "The Monday suit, which was filed with three divisions of the Justice Department, claims Sessions' misleading testimony \u2014 and his subsequent denials \u2014 amount to perjury, making false statements and obstruction of justice. \"At a period where there was such high focus on the Russia connections, Sessions must have known what he said was false,\" Larrabee told The News. Speaking on behalf of his clients, Larrabee added that an independent prosecutor should investigate Sessions' \"demonstrably false\" comments. Spokespeople with the Justice Department could not be immediately reached for comment. Sessions acknowledged he spoke with Kislyak at the Republican National Convention in July, and met with him again at his Senate office in September, but claim they never discussed President Trump's campaign. Sessions has since recused himself from any Justice Department investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and perceived communications between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The embattled attorney general is but one of many Trump associates and officials accused of improper communications with the Kremlin. Michael Flynn resigned as Trump's national security adviser last month after it became clear he had mislead senior officials about potentially illegal conversations held with Kislyak before Inauguration Day. Meanwhile, three Trump associates \u2014 including former campaign manager Paul Manafort \u2014 remain under FBI investigation over alleged ties to Russia. The FBI is also actively probing any broader patterns of collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Kremlin, director James Comey revealed last week. Larrabee speculated there will be more lawsuits against Trump officials in the near future."]

["new-york", "Union workers win $76M from firm that skirted deal with alter-ego - NY Daily News A Midtown construction company accused of creating a bogus business to avoid union wages and union benefit payments has to cough up $76 million to the workers it cheated. In a decision with potentially far-reaching consequences for city developers, Manhattan Federal Court Judge Colleen McMahon found that Navillus Tile fraudulently invented an alter-ego company to try and get around collectively bargained agreements it had with several major city construction unions. The company also had one of its legitimate offshoot businesses act as a Navillus stand-in on a job it wanted to do non-union, the ruling found. The collusion also involved real estate giant Related, one of the city's most prolific developers. It knowingly engaged with one of the alter-ego companies on its Upper East Side luxury development on 92nd St., Judge McMahon's ruling said. In her scathing, 95-page ruling delivered late Thursday after a three-year court battle, McMahon said that Navillus' founder, Donal O'Sullivan had \"perjured himself\" more than once and noted that another company principal was \"obviously lying\" in some testimony. Her feelings were clear in the $76 million award \u2014 a massive hit for Navillus Tile. It's also a strong warning to other New York companies looking to cheat their way out of union contracts, said attorney Tom Kennedy, who represented the coalition of unions that sued Navillus in 2014."]
["new-york", "\"The scale of the verdict is, we think, the largest of its type in the U.S. and it will grow at 9% interest until it's paid off,\" said Kennedy. \"People will now recognize that they are betting their entire company and can lose it if they are caught cheating with one of these double-breasted alter-ego operations,\" he said. The financial pain has to be carried by Navillus, which was the main generator of the alter-ego scam, but developer Related - which is currently doing the city's Hudson Yards project \u2014 also played a role, the attorney noted. \"It looks they were involved up to their eyeballs in this,\" he said. In a statement Navillus said it was a \"staunch\" labor backer and supporter of union pension funds. \"We are very disappointed by the court's verdict, a decision that is inconsistent with long-standing legal principles applicable to alleged alter ego cases such as this,\" the statement said. \"We are currently reviewing all of our options including appealing to a higher court to reverse this erroneous decision,\" it concluded.\u00a0 The $76 million in back wages and contributions to health, pension and general welfare funds will be split between the Metal Lathers Local 46, Cement and Concrete Workers District Council, Cement Masons Local 780, the District Council of Carpenters and Teamsters Local 282. They came together in 2014 to launch the complicated lawsuit against Navillus Tile, which had signed collective-bargaining agreements with all of them for a variety of jobs on construction sites."]
["new-york", "\"An alter-ego case is one of the most difficult to prove, you need a whole set of criteria and it can be very hard to find the documentation to back up the claims,\" said Terry Moore, business manager of Local 46. \"We were lucky that we were able to get a lot of things through discovery,\" he added. What the unions were able to show Judge McMahon was a clear money trail linking Navillus Tile to the creation of a company known as ACS. ACS was created to allow Navillus to tap non-union labor for its bids on projects \u2014 like the 92nd St. one done by Related. But such a move was in violation of Navillus' collectively bargained contracts with Local 46 and the other unions. Those contracts stipulate that the company can't fill their jobs with non-union workers. ACS existed on paper - but in reality it was just a sham for Navillus, Judge McMahon's ruling found. Navillus also got smacked for using one of its separate entities \u2014 a development company called Times Sq. \u2014 as an illegal stand in on a project known as the Sugar Hill job. For that deal, Times Sq. acted as the principal contractor \u2014 but it was merely a facade for Navillus, McMahon said. In arriving at her $76 million award, McMahon calculated the wages that the union workers would have gotten if they had been deployed on Navillus' jobs per their contract."]
["new-york", "She also calculated what the company would have paid in to the unions' health and benefit funds over the same time frame. In a peculiar twist of logic, the attorneys for Navillus had argued in court that McMahon's calculations were off. They claimed the judge should reduce the hours spent with non-union workers \u2014 because if the company had used union labor, the jobs would have been done faster. \"They produced expert testimony saying union companies were 17 to 22% more efficient ... and so the hours should be reduced based on that,\" said Kennedy. \"That's a lot of chutzpah.\""]

["news/politics", "N.Y. senator leader of breakaway dems got $34G stipend \u2014 up 24% - NY Daily News ALBANY \u2014 The head of a group of eight breakaway Senate Democrats this year took home a leadership stipend nearly 24% higher than the one he was paid in 2016, the Daily News has learned. Sen. Jeffrey Klein, the Bronx Dem who heads the Senate Independent Democratic Conference that\u2019s aligned with the GOP, received a $34,000 stipend this year \u2014 tied for the third highest in the chamber. That was up from $27,500 he received in 2016. Klein got the extra money after Senate GOP Leader John Flanagan formally named him the chamber\u2019s vice president pro tempore. He replaced longtime Sen. Hugh Farley, a Schenectady Republican who retired. The previous four years, Klein\u2019s title was Senate senior assistant majority leader, which carried the smaller stipend, or lulu. The $34,000 lulu is on top of Klein\u2019s base $79,500 legislative salary, meaning his total pay this year grew by 6.1% over 2016. \u201cSince the IDC was recognized in the Senate rules as a third conference, Senator Klein receives a leadership stipend, as do the other legislative leaders of the New York State Senate filed with the Secretary of the Senate in accordance with state law,\u201d his spokeswoman Candice Giove said. Another breakaway Democrat, Sen. David Valesky, of Syracuse, saw an even larger increase in his annual stipend. Valesky, who is deputy leader of the Independent Democratic Conference, this year was paid a $27,500 lulu to take over Klein\u2019s old title as senior assistant Senate majority leader."]
["news/politics", "The $27,500 nearly doubles the $15,000 he received in each of the past two years as vice chairman of the Senate Health Committee. Valesky\u2019s total pay this year grew by nearly 13%. Giove said Valesky for the first time is receiving a leadership stipend like deputy leaders in the chamber do, \u201cbringing parity to the conference.\u201d The new titles for Klein and Valesky were made official in a letter sent by Flanagan to Secretary of the Senate Francis Patience on March 6. The letter outlined all the leadership and committee chairmen appointments made by Flanagan. But unlike the dozens of other leadership and committee appointments, those of Klein and Valesky were not handed up in public on the floor to the clerk of the Senate. While doing it only by letter to the secretary of the Senate is legal under legislative law, critics say it\u2019s less transparent. While no one is questioning the legality of Klein or Valesky\u2019s specific lulus, the Senate stipend process has come under fire the past week after it was revealed that at least seven senators \u2014 including Valesky \u2014 in recent years received committee chairmen stipends even though they did not lead the panels that records submitted by the Senate to the state Controller\u2019s Office said they did. Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins Tuesday joined the chorus of those calling for a criminal investigation. \u201cIt seems every day troubling new questions arise and new details are learned about the apparent abuse of the Senate stipend system,\u201d Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cThe time has come for someone in authority to properly look into these obvious violations.\u201d"]
["news/politics", "Senate sources recently told The News that a lack of agreement in December on the first legislative pay raise since 1999, an attempt to keep Klein and his members happy, and Flanagan\u2019s desire to appease a number of his own upstate Republican members all played a part in the unusual pay outs. Klein and Senate Republicans said the payment of stipends to non-committee chairs was perfectly legal. They say the committee chairman title in the paperwork submitted with the controller\u2019s office was used as a type of accounting code rather than to identify the title of specific senators receiving the stipends. \u201cIf the Senate Democrats want to play politics, that's their choice,\u201d said Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif. \u201cWe have a lot of important work to do before the session concludes next month and that is what we are going to continue to focus on.\u201d Klein dubbed the controversy \u201cAlbany\u2019s version of lululand\u201d and dismissed as \"ridiculous and ludicrous\" criticism that his members are being bought off with committee stipends by the Republicans with whom they are aligned. \u201cI stand by the hard work of my members and we\u2019ll continue to accept a stipend for the hard work they do in connection with their committees,\u201d he said.

["sports/baseball/yankees", "Clippard even got his first major-league hit, a double to right-center off Scott Schoeneweis in the sixth that had fans chanting \"Ty-ler Clip-pard.\" \"He didn't look like he was intimidated,\" Jeter said. \"He was coming after guys, throwing strikes. He swung the bat well. He did pretty much everything.\" The victory gave the Yankees something to cling to with Boston coming to town for three games starting tonight, though they will start the series 10-1/2 games behind the Red Sox. Boston's victory over Atlanta yesterday was already glowing in orange on the Shea scoreboard while the Yanks and Mets played. Despite the loss, the Mets still won the series, two games to one, meaning the Empire State Building will be lit in their colors tonight. The Mets, who have won five consecutive series and were 7-3 on their 10-game home stand, also retained their season-high 2-1/2-game lead over the Braves in the NL East with a series in Atlanta starting tomorrow. Clippard, who was 3-2 with a 2.72 ERA at Triple-A Scranton before his callup, is the seventh rookie to make a start for the Yankees this season and the fifth different starter to make his major-league debut. No team in the last 50 years has had as many different rookies start so early in the season. No team this season has used more than two rookie starters. The Mets had no video of Clippard to study, according to David Wright, who nonetheless homered off Clippard for the only run the youngster allowed. The sole scouting report the Mets had was from the Double-A opener last year, Wright said."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "The lack of preparation showed and Clippard demonstrated he is much more polished than some mid-minors chucker, allowing only three hits and one run. He struck out six and walked three, one intentionally. He wriggled out of a bases-loaded jam in the second after Wright's homer had given the Mets a 1-0 lead and was never in trouble again. He retired the last seven batters he faced and 11 of the final 12. \"He had a little funkiness to him,\" said the Mets' Damion Easley, who homered in the ninth off Mariano Rivera. \"He threw everything at you. He leaned back and threw his elbow and everything else at you, and then came the ball.\" Early on, the night looked like it was going to be just another dreary one for the Yankees. In the third inning, they had consecutive doubles by Jeter and Hideki Matsui, but didn't score. The anomaly was made possible because Jeter had to hold up when center fielder Carlos Beltran dived for - but missed - Matsui's hit. They also squandered several chances against struggling Met starter John Maine (5-2), leaving a runner on second in the first inning, and runners on first and third in the second and second and third in the third. Maine, who started the season 5-0 but has been plagued by walks since, imploded in the fourth. He walked Bobby Abreu on four pitches to begin the inning and one out later he walked No.8 hitter Doug Mientkiewicz on four pitches, allowing Clippard to come to the plate and bunt the runners over."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "Damon followed with a flare into short right field that Shawn Green lunged for but couldn't reach. The hit went for a two-run double, giving the Yankees a jolt of life and the lead. Jeter followed with his third homer, a sharp line drive over the left-field wall. In the fifth inning, Posada slammed a 82 mile-per-hour changeup from Maine into the mezzanine down the right-field line. Rodriguez, who like Posada had also homered Saturday, swatted his 17th in the seventh inning to give the Yanks a 6-1 lead. Clippard, whose parents were at the game along with about a dozen other family members and friends, was the first Yankee to arrive. He got to the clubhouse at 3:15, nearly five hours before game time, and walked in to see only clubhouse workers there. He took a walk to see the dugout, how big the stadium was. He put on his favorite T-shirt, from the tournament his team won when he was 16. Clippard wears the shirt before every start. It reminds him of how much fun baseball can be, and was again last night. \"This is the best night of my life, for sure,\" Clippard said. \"No doubt about it.\""]

For the price of a cheap purple suitcase and a few $90 bus tickets, a Brooklyn woman had a crew of gun runners transport dozens of illegal firearms from Florida to New York, authorities said Wednesday. With her grandmother and two kids in tow, Natasha Harris, 33, routinely purchased pistols at gun shows in Florida, then secured the firearms in the cargo holds of inexpensive overnight commuter buses bound for New York. The buses were destined for Chinatown, where co-ringleader Quincy Adams, 35, unloaded the weapons and sold them for four times the original purchasing price in East New York, Brooklyn, state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. \u201cThese guns were not going to legitimate sportsmen or people concerned with public safety,\u201d Schneiderman said of the six-month investigation dubbed \u201cOperation Midnight Run.\u201d \u201cThese illegal guns were going to be used to rob and murder New Yorkers,\u201d Schneiderman said.

["sports/football/giants", "Giants GM Jerry Reese\u2019s comment raises idea Marshall Newhouse is\u00a0fighting for job\u00a0 Giants GM Jerry Reese gave a confusing review of presumed starting right tackle Marshall Newhouse on Sunday, expressing \"confidence in our offensive line\" while noting Newhouse is \"in a battle over there with Bobby Hart and some more guys out there\" and urging Newhouse's doubters not to \"count him out.\" Newhouse, 27, a six-year veteran who started 14 games for Big Blue last season, had started just seven games combined the previous two seasons for the Green Bay Packers and Cincinnati Bengals, respectively. Reese was thought to be interested in upgrading the right side of his line of Newhouse and right guard John Jerry, but he did not draft an offensive lineman nor did he sign meaningful free-agent competition this offseason. The potential silver lining to that strategy is returning a full, five-man unit with improved chemistry, including left tackle Ereck Flowers, left guard Justin Pugh and center Weston Richburg. But Reese's mention of the second-year backup Hart, 21, who committed an obvious false start penalty on Saturday, calls into question whether the full starting five will stay intact. Reese also insisted that the Giants' offensive line was not far off, in his opinion, from those of the two teams in last season's Super Bowl, the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers. \"Newhouse has played a lot of football, he's a seventh-year guy,\" Reese said. \"We'll always try to upgrade every position as we move along, but we think we have a very competent offensive line that can get the job done.\""]
["sports/football/giants", "On the business end, Reese said the Giants have \"had some discussion\" about locking up Pugh, 25, and Richburg, 25, to more lucrative long-term contracts, but he refused to elaborate. \"Yeah I mean that's part of the process of what we do,\" Reese said. \"We've had some discussion, but right now's not the time to talk about that.\" DEEP DROPS AND GRABS Janoris Jenkins, 27, whom Reese signed to a five-year, $62.5 million deal as the marquee cornerback on the free agent market this offseason, had a tough practice Sunday. He knocked Beckham out of practice after colliding with the receiver on a deep pass, and he was burnt deep by second-string wideout Myles White. Jenkins couldn't claim the worst mistake of practice, though. Running back Bobby Rainey, who needs an exceptional camp to crack the final roster, dropped a wide-open wheel route from backup QB Ryan Nassib that would have gone for a touchdown and hit Rainey square in the hands. Practice was moved indoors for the second time in the Giants' first three days of camp due to inclement weather. LESSON LEARNED Class was in session Sunday for rookie safety Darian Thompson, who continues to run with the first team alongside returning starter Landon Collins, when Beckham snagged a deep pass down the left sideline that Thompson should have made a play on."]
["sports/football/giants", "\"He learned a great lesson today out there against a deep ball,\" Reese said of Thompson. \"You have to go get the ball in this league. You can't sit back there and catch it like a punt. He was kind of waiting on that ball, and Odell took the ball right from his hands. Great teaching tape for him today, that's the way the big boys do it in this league. (Thompson) is doing a nice job, but there's some more safeties doing a nice job there, as well. There's gonna be a good battle for the other safety position on the other side of Collins.\" Nat Berhe, 25, and Mykkele Thompson, 23, are others in contention for the second starting safety spot."]

I've always believed that whatever leaders do in moderation, followers will often do in excess. EXCLUSIVE: MAN BLASTS MUSLIMS, HITS WORKER AT NYC EATERY So as Donald Trump speaks from the microphone on closing down mosques and banning Muslims from entering the country, what regular men and women do with such thoughts can go south very quickly. Such is the case right outside my hometown of Atlanta. In Gwinnett County, Georgia, which is just about 15 minutes north of downtown Atlanta, a young Muslim girl from Somalia was subjected to a horrific moment by a teacher at Shiloh Middle School. Walking down the hall, the young daughter of Abdirazik Aden, a Somalian grocery store owner, was randomly confronted by a teacher who asked her what she had in her backpack. When his daughter, surprised by the question, told the teacher she had books in it, the teacher stopped her and asked her if she had a bomb. Understandably, the student was disturbed and immediately called her father to tell him of the incident. School officials, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, have confirmed the unnamed female teacher did indeed ask her if she had a bomb. But they have been relatively flippant in how they've handled the fallout, saying it was a \"mistake.\""]

It's preposterous. What the Gwinnett County school system is failing to understand in this situation is that words come from somewhere. Why was this student, a young Somali Muslim girl, asked if she had a bomb? Did the teacher regularly ask other kids if they had bombs? Were they Muslims, too? In addition to disciplining this teacher for her horrific question, Gwinnett County Schools should immediately consider district-wide training on cultural and religious sensitivity for its teachers. If they don't see how big a problem this is, though, we're doomed."]
["news/national", "Thousands forced to flee homes near California's Oroville Dam - NY Daily News Authorities ordered more than 188,000 people to abandon their homes downriver of the nation\u2019s tallest dam in California, fearing the dam\u2019s compromised spillway could unleash uncontrollable flood waters. Butte County Sheriff's Office cited \"severe erosion\" \u2014 a hulking 200-foot-long and 30-foot-deep sinkhole \u2014 along the Oroville Dam's emergency spillway for setting off a mass evacuation following days of torrential rainfall in the Sierra Nevada foothills. The dam itself is structurally sound, authorities noted. The mandatory evacuations issued around 4 p.m. resulted in gridlock as drivers in Oroville, and nearly a dozen other cities within 13 miles downstream of the massive structure, packed up their belongings and attempted to leave.

At the peak of its flood threat, the man-made Lake Oroville was at 101% capacity with at least two inches of water careening over the spillway, according to California's Department of Water Resources. The water has since reduced and is no longer spilling over the spillway, according to the agency's director, William Croyle. At another press briefing on Sunday night, he said engineers hope to lower the lake\u2019s level by at least 50 feet. Croyle described a chaotic week for the dam's infrastructure and said the damaged spillway that panicked authorities had never been used in its 50 year history. Another hole was discovered in the dam\u2019s primary spillway on Thursday. \"The events starting last Tuesday has thrown a lot of curves,\" Croyle said. Additionally, engineers did not anticipate a flood threat on Saturday despite the higher than normal water capacity in Lake Oroville.

["opinion", " Devin Nunes pro-Trump moves come amid tightened reelection bid  It may claim the FBI withheld information from a federal judge who may have authorized a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to conduct electronic surveillance of a U.S. person. As one who has participated in countless FISA applications, as a writer, editor, and approver, I highly doubt that occurred. The approval process for a FISA warrant of this nature is extensive and involves two branches of government. In a matter such as the Russia investigation, possibly involving high-level government officials, the scrutiny is amplified. Sure, the occasional mistake does happen. But when it does, it is quickly, even ruthlessly, corrected. Willful misconduct is, at a minimum, a firing offense. That's why it is rare, even on cases of much lesser profile, that mistakes happen. The strenuous oversight, and the penalties for violating it, makes it so. Still, that rigorous adherence to the law and Constitutional responsibility to our fellow Americans has not prevented Nunes and company from accusing otherwise. Truth be told, I'd welcome it wholeheartedly if it were valid, or had a legal basis. But it doesn't. On Wednesday of this week, the FBI issued a public statement about the memo. The statement noted \"material omissions\" that \"fundamentally impact\" the document's accuracy.

["sports/football", "Gola: Give Patriots credit for Super game plan  - NY Daily News GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Not many Super Bowls were as well-played or as well-coached as this one, even though it ended on a bizarre play call. The chess match that preceded it, and how the players on both teams executed their moves, made for fascinating football. Here\u2019s a look at some of those aspects: THE CALL\r\n\tWith all the X\u2019s and O\u2019s, it came down to one bad play call, the goal-line pass that Malcolm Butler picked off with Marshawn Lynch watching. According to Pete Carroll, Seattle didn\u2019t want to run against the Pats\u2019 goal-line defense. But defensive coordinator Matt Patricia threw in a wrinkle, putting three cornerbacks on the field. Russell Wilson thought it was going to be a TD, that Butler just made a great play. \u201cWe had a formation where we could throw it,\u201d he said. \u201cLockette was coming underneath and the guy made a great play. We had a chance, he was open and the guy cut in front of it and made a play.\u201d But really, the Pats defense was looking for the play. \u201cWe knew it was going to be a man beater because they\u2019re a man team and we knew because of their alignment,\u201d said Bradon Browner. \u201cIt was a stack look by their receivers and it forces us to be tight on those guys.\u201d Browner couldn\u2019t believe the call by his old team."]
["sports/football", "\u201cMan, what were they thinking?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the best back in the game. Sometimes teams out-strategize themselves. That\u2019s what happened tonight.\u201d BUTLER DOING IT\r\n\tWilson just didn\u2019t stay away from Darrelle Revis. He did a pretty good job of avoiding Browner, too. Instead, the Seahawks attacked Kyle Arrington and Logan Ryan, finding a mismatch with unknown Chris Matthews at 6-5. Wilson was stymied early but, as he often does, he came up with a big play out of the blue when he saw Matthews isolated on Arrington up the right sideline. Wilson\u2019s arm is underrated. He has the ability to get the ball up in the air and Matthews made a great adjustment on the ball to set up Seattle\u2019s first TD. His second catch went for a TD after the Seahawks had 31 seconds left to work with at the end of the first half. It was Ryan playing too far off in the red zone and Matthews setting up on the goal line for a textbook back shoulder throw. Arrington didn\u2019t survive his mistakes. He was pulled by Bill Belichick with Butler taking his place in the nickel. It turned out to be a stroke of genius. LEGION OF ROOM\r\n\tThe Seahawks\u2019 defense works downhill, in other words, north-south. The Patriots made them work east-west with crosses, drags and pick/screens, using every receiver. You didn\u2019t see Kam Chancellor laying the wood on anyone as he did in last year\u2019s game against those shallow crossing routes the Broncos run."]
["sports/football", "Instead, the Pats took away the Seahawks\u2019 aggressiveness by formation and with a general concept of running the corners off, clearing out zones and coming underneath the linebackers. Early in the game, it was a matter of taking little chunks but by the end of the first half, those zones were breaking open even more, allowing the backs and receivers to get the ball in space. They were forcing defenders to run crossfield with motion while sending LB Bobby Wagner to the flat to cover those screens and swing passes. Brady used the check-down often. It took patience. \u201cA lot. That was a big word for us this week. We talked about having patience and poise,\u201d offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said. \u201cWe knew we weren\u2019t going to drive the ball in four plays. This is a great defense and they don\u2019t give up many plays. It was an execution game. We needed to execute consecutive plays and just continue to do that as many plays as we could.\u201d The strategy wasn\u2019t novel. The Broncos, after learning their lesson in last year's Super Bowl, did a lot of it in their regular season game. So did the Chargers when they beat the Seahawks early in the year. WHERE\u2019S GRONK?\r\n\tThe Patriots lined tight end Rob Gronkowski up everywhere, even the backfield. He was outside the numbers on the first play of the game, where Richard Sherman went out to pick him up. The Seahawks didn\u2019t double him but he was up against different defenders \u2014 Chancellor, Richard Sherman and K.J. Wright."]
["sports/football", "Brady went to him early on a pick play and tried to take a shot against Chancellor up the seam in the end zone. Chancellor got inside him. No chance. But after opening up all those underneath routes, the Pats eventually removed Gronk from the formation again and this time Wright walked out to the sideline with him. Brady recognized the mismatch immediately. Gronkowski is too fast for any linebacker to stay with him. It was an easy 22-yard TD pass. They went to him again against Wright for a big first down on the go-ahead TD drive in the fourth quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s a zone team and a lot of times there\u2019s not a lot of space,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cThey were conscious of Gronk. We didn\u2019t expect this to be a game where Gronk came in and dominated the whole game because they don\u2019t play much man-to-man coverage. He made his plays when he had his opportunities.\u201d The strategy allowed the Patriots to keep throwing it. How confident were they that they could against this D? \u201cWith Tommy, as confident as you could possibly be,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to do this numerous times, the first playoff game against Baltimore. If it wasn\u2019t him, I\u2019m not sure we would have had that to say let\u2019s use that to be our version of the running game. But he allows us to do so many things and we never consider that deviation from the game plan.

Unfortunately for parents as well as teens around the country, the dominant drug education curriculum centers around one message: Just Say No. Abstain not only from alcohol, but from marijuana and harder drugs. While we agree this is the ideal scenario, it is simply not reality. More than half of high school seniors say they have tried illegal drugs (including prescription drugs not under doctor\u2019s orders) at some point in their lifetime, and 68% say they have tried alcohol (itself a potent drug) at some point in their lives. This is despite more than $1 billion in our tax dollars the federal government allocates for drug prevention each year.

Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones confirmed Wednesday that DeAngelo was a police officer in Exeter, near Visalia, from 1973 to 1976. That tenure overlapped with the notorious Visalia Ransacker case involving an assailant who burglarized homes and murdered College of the Sequoias journalism professor Claude Snelling.

The statement said three U.N. staffers and seven aid workers, all of them South Sudanese, went missing early Wednesday when their convoy driving from Yei town to Tore in Central Equatoria disappeared. The aid workers are with South Sudanese Development Organization, ACROSS, Plan International and Action Africa Help.

This is the third time aid workers have been held by armed groups in the last six months alone, the statement said. Seven local aid workers seized by opposition forces earlier this month in the same area were later freed. Two other local aid workers were killed in a separate incident this month in Unity state. \"We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being,\" Noudehou said. South Sudan is one of the world's most dangerous places for humanitarians. At least 98 have been killed since the civil war began in December 2013, most of them local workers.

A decades-old regulation, put in place to protect customers, bars New York City eateries from such charges. But restaurateurs say the fee is needed to counterbalance significant increases in tipped and minimum wages, as well as minimum pay requirements for salaried workers. \"We are getting killed,\" said John Bloostein, who owns four Heartland Brewery restaurants in Manhattan. \"There's a huge amount of pressure on us.\" On Wednesday, Bloostein brought an oversized sign highlighting his industry's plight to the steps of City Hall. The massive poster \u2014 begging de Blasio to approve the surcharge proposal \u2014 was signed by a host of big restaurant owners in the city. The effort renews a sputtered attempt in 2015 to secure the surcharge. \"Only New York City prohibits this practice, which is the most competitive and challenging restaurant industry,\" said Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. \"The industry has been waiting patiently for two years, they desperately want this option,\" he said. \"Hopefully the mayor will support local restaurants.\" Restaurant owners say raising prices on menu items would cost them customers.

Dr. Tim R. Thayne Raising a teenager can be a challenge under the best circumstances. But when a teenager's addictions, learning disabilities or emotional and behavioral issues become more than parents can bear, the young people often are placed in residential or wilderness treatment programs where professionals help them work through their issues. Success can quickly unravel when the child returns home, though, if parents aren't ready with a game plan to help with the transition. Parents often fear that their son or daughter is going to relapse into old, unhealthy or dangerous patterns. They have fears about how their child will connect socially with other people and whether they will find the right friends. They fear their teen will fall further behind in academics. One way parents can ease the transition is by identifying natural mentors for their teen. A natural mentor \u2014 such as a neighbor, teacher, relative or coach \u2014 is typically more effective than an officially assigned mentor. Studies suggest that most formal mentoring relationships last less than a year. In contrast, natural mentoring relationships, which come from the church, school, family and neighborhood, are far more durable, with the average lasting nine years."]
["life-style", "Parents should know when and how to grant back privileges and freedoms to their teenager. Don't let your teen pressure you into promising the return of certain privileges. Long before they come home, teens in treatment often begin asking what they are going to be able to do and how soon. They want back the freedoms they once had, such as cell phone and car use, sleepovers, computer time, dating, time with friends and so forth. If there is ever a time not to buckle under pressure from your teen, it's now while they are still in the program. If your teen is going to be angry, let the program deal with the fallout. When they do come home, don't make a rule you aren't willing to back up. Consistency is key. Over time, as your trust grows, be ready to hand out rewards before being asked, but this doesn't have to be done all at once. Things can be handed out for a weekend trial, or at a level of 50% of what your child initially pushed for. It's helpful to parents to find someone they can speak with about their own emotions. They can seek counsel from a therapist or a coach who has experience working with parents in this situation. That counselor will be better equipped to help you through this transition. Nothing will surprise them; not your fears, not your questions, not your situation. In addition to an expert coach, it also helps to have a trusted friend you can vent to as well."]

["sports/football/giants", "Previewing what Giants, Gettleman may do with No. 2 pick in draft - NY Daily News If only the NFL Draft were still held at Radio City Music Hall. That\u2019s the only way Thursday night\u2019s first round would feel any bigger for New York, and for the Giants. They hold the No. 2 overall pick for the first time since 1981, when then-GM George Young selected Lawrence Taylor out of North Carolina. \u201cLT\u201d became the greatest Giant ever and is in the Hall of Fame. This time, Dave Gettleman will sit in the GM\u2019s chair, and he will watch the Cleveland Browns make their No. 1 overall pick, and then he will have 10 minutes to work the phones, trade back, draft a quarterback or take the best available position player before putting the Jets on the clock at No. 3. It\u2019s only the biggest decision any Giants GM has had to make since they last picked in the top five in 2004, when Gettleman\u2019s good friend and mentor, Ernie Accorsi, drafted Philip Rivers at No. 4 and traded him in a package to the San Diego Chargers for No. 1 overall pick Eli Manning. \u201cWhen you\u2019re picking this high, if you make a mistake, you\u2019re done,\u201d Gettleman said last week. At least he\u2019s aware. So here is where Gettleman and the Giants stand on the pick: Saquon Barkley, the dynamic Penn State running back, is the favorite to be the Giants\u2019 choice at No. 2."]
["sports/football/giants", "Ownership, Gettleman and new head coach Pat Shurmur all have placed a heavy emphasis on playing at least two more years with Eli Manning at quarterback, and all of their actions this offseason have pointed to arming this Giants team to turn around from its 3-13 season and try to win a third Super Bowl with Manning. N.C. State defensive end Bradley Chubb could be Gettleman\u2019s choice, too. Gettleman in five drafts as the Carolina Panthers GM (2013-17) selected a defensive lineman twice in the first round: Star Lotulelei 14th overall out of Utah in 2013 and Vernon Butler 30th overall out of Louisiana Tech in 2016. And the Giants love Chubb. But they also love Barkley. Gettleman just drafted Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey eighth overall last spring for the Panthers, and neither he nor Shurmur thinks No. 2 is too high to take a back, despite the economics of the draft dictating that a high pick means a high price for that cheaper RB position. \u201cIf you have a great running back, he immediately makes your quarterback better, your offensive line better and your passing game,\u201d Gettleman said. USC quarterback Sam Darnold, believed by many to be the Giants\u2019 preferred quarterback in this draft class, is likely to go to the Browns first overall, though Cleveland has kept its pick close to the vest. Assuming that happens, it\u2019s not out of the question Gettleman would consider a quarterback such as Wyoming\u2019s Josh Allen (Shurmur likes tall QBs) or Josh Rosen."]
["sports/football/giants", "There is more expectation around the league that instead of going QB, Gettleman will continue to seriously consider trading back if he gets legitimate offers from teams hoping to charge up for a quarterback. The Giants need to add depth, not just talent. Gettleman has been speaking to teams for weeks, however, and hasn\u2019t yet swung a deal. Part of the reason is that the Giants likely do not want to move as far back as No. 12, where the Buffalo Bills sit, because their only reward for a terrible 2017 season is this No. 2 pick and a chance to take a great player. The other is that Gettleman never has traded down, and many believe he won\u2019t start now, especially if he has a dynamic player in mind. Barkley appears to be that player. And if the Giants are going to draft a non-QB, frankly, he should be the one. Because this offense needs talent more than this defense. Even when the Giants went 11-5 in 2016 under Ben McAdoo, the offense was Odell Beckham Jr. and that\u2019s it. They won on the back of a talented defense that still has the players and just battled a lot of other issues last year. Drafting a running back high is risky. Only two RBs have gone No. 1 overall from 1982 on: Auburn\u2019s Bo Jackson to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1986 and Penn State\u2019s Ki-Jana Carter to the Cincinnati Bengals in 1995. Before that, backs such as Earl Campbell (Houston Oilers, 1978) and O.J. Simpson (Buffalo Bills, 1969) topped their drafts."]
["sports/football/giants", "The No. 2 slot has been hit or miss for RBs, as well: Reggie Bush (New Orleans Saints, 2006), Ronnie Brown (Miami Dolphins, 2005), Marshall Faulk (Indianapolis Colts, 1994), Blair Thomas (Jets, 1990), Eric Dickerson (LA Rams, 1983) and Tony Dorsett (Dallas Cowboys, 1977). Campbell, Simpson, Faulk, Dickerson and Dorsett are Hall of Famers. Carter and Thomas, on the other hand, are two examples of Penn State running backs who have fizzled due to injury. The Giants will be gambling big-time by passing on the opportunity to take a quarterback with Manning 37 years old. If they love one of these quarterbacks and he\u2019s available at two, they have to take him. But if they\u2019re not enamored with a passer, Barkley \u2014 or a trade a few picks down to acquire assets and still get a top player like Chubb or even Notre Dame offensive guard Quenton Nelson \u2014 looks like their best bet.\u00a0"]

The offer to help came Wednesday from Trump attorney Joanna Hendon, who wrote to Judge Kimba Wood one day before Michael Cohen is due back in court regarding the FBI raid on his law office and other locations. \"Our client will make himself available, as needed, to aid in our privilege review on his behalf,\" Hendon wrote. Cohen, Trump and the Trump organization argue that many of Cohen's documents and other materials are subject to attorney-client privilege. The feds are reportedly investigating Cohen for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. In a separate letter, Cohen's legal team said it expected to begin reviewing the evidence seized by the government on Wednesday. Cohen's lawyer Todd Harrison wrote that prosecutors had sent his firm, McDermott, Will & Emery, a hard drive of evidence seized by the FBI via FedEx. They expected to immediately begin reviewing the material upon receipt. Prosecutors are expected to continue sharing the material on a rolling basis. The firm had assembled a veritable war room of attorneys and other legal experts, Harrison said. \"The Discovery Center team is comprised of 27 attorneys and technology professionals who have decades of experience managing complex, large-scale document review and production under tight deadlines,\" Harrison said. \"The systems have been tested and vetted.\""]

Cohen has proposed appointing a so-called Special Master who would determine what documents were privileged, should disputes arise between prosecutors and defense attorneys. Wood has appeared open to the suggestion, especially when it comes to documents involving Trump. \"Counsel should be prepared to address the process to be undertaken by a Special Master, should one be appointed, to review claims of privilege. In advance of the conference, the Court seeks a clearer understanding of the resources counsel for Mr. Cohen (Trump and the Trump Organization) have available to review materials for privilege and to produce such materials to a Special Master,\" Wood wrote in an order detailing the agenda for Thursday's hearing. The government has countered that the standard protocol for document review is sufficient. Under the government's proposal, a separate team of prosecutors would review the materials for attorney-client privilege before turning them over to the team actually investigating Cohen. Trump's loudmouth lawyer has actually has done little legal work, prosecutors have argued.

["life-style", "We should be arming students with coping skills, not guns - NY Daily News There have been more than 60 school shootings since the Sandy Hook attack in 2012, according to a recent analysis. Since the Feb. 14 Parkland, Fla., shooting, the Educators School Safety Network has recorded an increase in school-based violent threats across the nation: 50 threats per day on average. In the 2017-18 school year, there have been violent incidents or threats in 48 states to date. As we reflect on these devastating statistics, the obvious question on our minds is: What could have been done to prevent these tragedies, and what should be done going forward? Over the past few months, it\u2019s been impossible to try to navigate the news and social media without a bombardment of finger-pointing on all sides, and speculation as to what to do next. The gun control vs. mental health debate is wide open yet again, and once more we all have questions that remainunanswered. Is this what mental illness looks like? What if we flagged certain individuals from ever being able to get their hands on a gun? Could the school have done anything else to prevent this tragedy? What is the best way support the grieving and traumatized survivors after the helicopters and media leave town? In my experience, both on a personal level (I lost my brother to suicide) and as a mental health professional, I\u2019ve witnessed time and time again that the right amount of insight and education, combined with the right amount of consistent action, can begin a remarkable transformation process that helps individuals live up to their potential."]
["life-style", "Not only is the process attainable, but it should be easily accessible for every individual, especially our youth. These individuals were not given the tools to live up to their potential. The individuals that reach this extreme level on the mental illness spectrum tend to share a feeling of isolation, extreme frustration and anger, an overpowering sense of hopelessness, and the belief that they are unable to have control in the outcome of their future. Isolation comes from the lack of \u201cfeeling\u201d connected. Many of these individuals had friends, parents that cared for them, and access to support. However, they tend to lack a shared language of how to connect \u2014 how to share what one is experiencing and on the other side, how to listen with a tuned ear the sense of pain that the individual is living with. This pain can be real or it can be perceived; either way the pain is real for the individual and coping with that pain ultimately will transfer into behaviors that will affect their relationships with the outside world. My fear is that people see an individual that has gone to an extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to mental illness and they point a finger and say, \u201cthat\u2019s what mental illness looks like.\u201d That is wrong. This is not the face of mental illness, and putting this face on a much larger issue will ultimately lead to more people dying."]

What if we started to implement social and emotional learning programs into every school immediately? It\u2019s been scientifically proven that it would look something like this: \u00a0 Better SAT Scores.\n\r\n\t\tImproved pro-social behaviors\n\r\n\t\tReduction in conduct problems\n\r\n\t\tDecrease in emotional distress\n\r\n\t\tBetter ability to make decisions\n\r\n\t\tGreater understanding of conflict resolution\n\r\n\t\tAnd countless other positive outcomes that we all desperately want for our youth \u00a0 Unfortunately, many schools administrators have opposed the idea of social emotional learning, believing them to take up too much time.

Would a ban on guns have stopped the shooter in Parkland from taking his anger and isolation out on innocent people? Probably not. Could more be done in regard to gun control? Of course."]

Markets are waiting to hear bank President Mario Draghi's assessment at a news conference following the stand-pat decision by the bank's 25-member governing council. The eurozone economy turned in strong growth of 2.5 percent last year, the best in a decade. But recent economic data has been mixed. If growth shows signs of slowing that could be a reason to extend the bank's 30 billion euros ($36 billion) in bond purchases. Currently they are set to run at least through September. Recent economic data has been conflicting, with business managers' surveys indicating continued robust activity, contrasted with dips in industrial production in the first two months of the year. The key question is whether the economy is really running out of steam or just going through a period of slightly slower growth. Fears about a trade conflict between the U.S. and China involving higher import taxes have weighed on some gauges of business confidence. Analysts think Draghi will be in no hurry to signal whether the bond purchases, which began in March 2015, will continue past September or not. One reason for that is markets could anticipate any decision to end the program by prematurely sending up interest rates, which would blunt the remaining impact of the stimulus.  Many expect a clearer sign on what will happen after September at the bank's June 14 or July 26 meeting."]

Any slowing of growth could mean it could take even longer for the ECB to reach its goal.

["life-style", "Why it's urgent to understand the cost of growing old  - NY Daily News Many young, healthy Americans may not realize that they share something troubling in common with each other. There's a good chance they could spend the later years of their lives in long-term care, a situation that might drain their finances and leave them dependent on the government to survive. Families go broke quickly trying to provide long-term care for a loved one. Unfortunately, too many people wait until they are in the middle of a crisis before they start trying to figure out how the world of long-term care works. If you're convinced that long-term care is something that happens to others, but not to you, you could be right. But the odds aren't reassuring. Roughly half of Americans who live beyond 65 (46.7% of men and 57.5% of women) at some point will require at least some form of long-term care, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. And that could prove financially problematic. The average monthly nursing-home cost is $7,148 for a semi-private room and $8,121 for a private room, according to the Genworth 2017 Cost of Care Survey. The average monthly cost for an assisted-living facility is $3,750. But don't despair just yet. Like so many things in life, tackling the problem of paying for long-term care begins with educating yourself. A few factors related to the cost of growing old that are important to know include:"]
["life-style", "- Medicare and Medicaid aren't the same. These two similarly named programs confuse lots of people. Medicare is a federal program that provides health care for people 65 and older. It does not cover long-term care. Medicaid provides health care for people with very low income. It does cover long-term care, but with caveats. The person must qualify financially and also meet the definition of medical necessity. Older people who need to go into a nursing home sometimes deplete their savings so they can qualify for Medicaid. The cost of some care is all on you. Most forms of home care and assisted living are private pay, which means you need resources other than Medicaid to cover the monthly out-of-pocket expenses. Long-term care insurance can help. Many people buy long-term care insurance, which can pay for nursing home, assisted living and at-home care. A big concern here is that someone might fail to make their premium payments and let the policy lapse before they can use it. Life insurance can be a lifeline. One untapped resource for many seniors is the life insurance policy that they thought wouldn't pay anything until they died. The owner of a life policy can exchange it for long-term care benefits to cover any form of care they choose. Many people don't really grasp how much it can cost to grow old, partly because it's hard for them to think of themselves in a nursing home some day. But if you take the time to understand what it all means - and the options you have for paying for long-term care - then you can avoid putting your older self in a precarious financial position."]

["newswires/news/national", "Senate committee poised for vote on bill to protect Mueller - NY Daily News WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to vote Thursday on a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's job \u2014 legislation that has split Republicans as President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Mueller's Russia investigation. Two Republicans and two Democrats introduced the bill earlier this month as Trump ramped up criticism of the special counsel. Mueller is investigating potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign as well as possible obstruction of justice by the president. The measure under consideration would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of a firing and would put into law existing Justice Department regulations that a special counsel must be fired for good cause. A handful of Republicans have supported it, but most have opposed it, arguing that it is unconstitutional or unnecessary. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has argued that Trump won't move to fire Mueller and has insisted he will not hold a full Senate vote on the legislation. Republicans who support the bill could be at risk of angering Trump and some of his supporters they represent. But the four lawmakers who wrote the legislation \u2014 GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrats Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 are hoping to win enough bipartisan support to move it out of committee. Then, they say, they could try and find enough support in the full Senate to persuade McConnell to change his mind."]
["newswires/news/national", "With most Democrats on board, the bipartisan group has been working in recent days to gather additional Republican votes. They have been negotiating with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who had floated an amendment that included increased reporting to Congress by the special counsel. Democrats had initially opposed Grassley's amendment, saying it could undermine the investigation if the special counsel had to reveal too much to Congress during the investigation. But a revised Grassley amendment released Wednesday evening appeared to be a potential compromise, dropping a section that would have required the special counsel's office to report to Congress if the scope of the investigation changed while it was ongoing. The revised amendment would require that notification after the investigation was done, along with a report detailing the investigation's findings and explanations of any charges. The Grassley amendment would also require notification if a special counsel were removed. Republicans opposing the bipartisan bill are expected to vote for an alternative resolution that would express a nonbinding \"sense of the Senate\" that Mueller should be left alone to do his job. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate and a member of the Judiciary panel, endorsed that idea Wednesday, saying it had a more realistic chance of passing than the bipartisan bill. He is expected to propose the resolution at Thursday's vote. The resolution \"may be a way forward because it avoids the unconstitutionality issue on a bill that the president won't sign and the House won't pass,\" Cornyn said. \"So that may be a place for us to land.\""]

["sports/baseball/yankees", "If it helps Sonny Gray, Aaron Boone needs to use Austin Romine - NY Daily News Aaron Boone can fight the idea of a personal catcher all he wants, but Sonny Gray has been much more effective pitching to Austin Romine than Gary Sanchez, and soon enough the manager may have no choice but to give in to whatever works best. At the very least, Boone needs to find out one way or the other, which is why Romine was behind the plate on Wednesday night for Gray's home start against the Twins. Gray had been a disappointment through his first four starts, posting an 8.29 ERA, but much more so in the last two with Sanchez catching him. In those games, he pitched a total of only 6 1/3 innings, giving up 11 runs while walking more hitters than he struck out, by a count of 6-3. Meanwhile, in his first two starts of the season, with Romine catching him, Gray was far from great but he was significantly better, allowing a total of four runs over 10 innings, while getting 12 strikeouts to five walks. In addition, since the Yankees acquired Gray from the A's at the trade deadline last summer, the righthander has a 5.94 ERA in 10 games with Sanchez catching him, compared to 2.20 in five games with Romine. So no one was surprised that Boone found a way to catch Romine in this start, even if he indicated he wouldn't have done if not for the day game to follow, necessitating that Sanchez be the DH either Wednesday or Thursday."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "Boone did acknowledge the numbers could be more than a coincidence. \"There's probably that comfort level (with Romine),\" Boone said. \"Sonny came over here and the connection, the catcher-pitcher relationship does matter. \"But it is something that we want to continue to build with both Austin and Gary so that we're getting to a point where we feel good about both guys being in there when Sonny is hopefully off and rolling.\" The question is why the disparity with the two catchers, and considering how much Gray tries to get hitters to chase pitches in the dirt, it seems reasonable to believe he's not as confident with Sanchez, whose problems with blocking balls are well-documented. In fact, Gray has thrown five wild pitches in his two starts with Sanchez, compared to zero in the two starts with Romine, mostly because the backup catcher is better at softening his body while blocking balls to keep them from rolling far enough away to allow runners to advance. Boone disputed that notion, perhaps because he simply wants to support his starting catcher. \"No, I don't think it's that,\" the manager said. \"I just think when he came over here they just kind of connected and got on the same page. So I just think it's a comfort level and hopefully this will be something that will be the start of Sonny starting to turn the corner, because obviously he's important to us.\""]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "If Gray's problems aren't related to the catcher, the Yankees privately will be even more mystified as to why he has pitched so tentatively, as if afraid to throw strikes. As it is, Boone tried to explain what he believes is the issue. \"I think a lot of it has to do with his talent in that he's capable of doing a lot of things,\" the manager said. \"He gets great movement on his pitches, he's got really good stuff, so I sometimes feel it's a case of he feels like he can always make the perfect pitch. \"I think if he just pounds the zone with that and trusts it a little more, the success is right there to follow.\" Whatever the issue, the Yankees gave up three top prospects to get Gray, thinking he'd be at worst a No. 2-type starter, and though he pitched well at times last year after the trade, he wasn't nearly as consistent as the team expected. Gray, who can be a free agent after next season, has plenty of time to make this look like a good trade, but the way things are going that could depend more on what the A's get out of James Kaprielian, Dustin Fowler and Jorge Mateo. Kaprielian was the player the A's had to have in the trade, so it could be awhile before any conclusions can be drawn, as the former first-round pick out of UCLA is still rehabbing from Tommy John surgery that he underwent last spring while still in the Yankees' system."]
["sports/baseball/yankees", "Meanwhile, as of Wednesday, Fowler and Mateo were off to slow starts in Triple-A with the A's. Fowler, the outfielder who missed the last two months of the season after injuring his knee in that crash into the stands in Chicago just one inning into his major-league debut, was hitting .275 with a .615 OPS, two doubles and no home runs through 17 games. Mateo, the speedy shortstop, was hitting .182 with a .225 on-base percentage and a .437 OPS. Mostly alarmingly, he already had 22 strikeouts to just four walks. So far, then, there's no reason for the Yankees to regret the trade. But that could change if Gray doesn't start pitching with dominance. If that requires having Romine behind the plate, so be it."]
["newswires/news/national", "Sessions defends Trump pardons of Joe Arpaio, Scooter Libby - NY Daily News WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday defended President Donald Trump's right to pardon former Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Bush administration official I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. Both of those pardons were issued by Trump and bypassed the involvement of the Justice Department and its pardon attorney, which historically reviews petitions for clemency and makes recommendations. Sessions made the comments at a Senate subcommittee hearing where Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, reminded him that as a Republican senator from Alabama, Sessions had once defended the role of the Justice Department's pardon attorney. Sessions said he stood by that assessment. But he also said that there was no question that the president had the constitutional authority to issue pardons without the Justice Department's involvement and that there was no requirement that a president seek the opinion of the pardon attorney. \"It's clearly within the power of the president to execute pardons without the pardon attorney,\" Sessions said. He acknowledged under questioning that he could not recall any pardon during President Barack Obama's administration that did not go through the Justice Department, but he complained about pardons from President Bill Clinton that he considered objectionable. \"I would just say that pardons that President Clinton were made were stunning, shocking and unacceptable on the merits,\" he said in a raised voice. That was likely a reference to the 2001 pardon of fugitive businessman Marc Rich, an act that later came under federal investigation."]
["newswires/news/national", "He defended Arpaio as a legitimate pardon candidate because of the former Arizona sheriff's advanced age of 85 and misdemeanor contempt-of-court conviction. He also said Libby had \"contributed greatly to America.\" Libby, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted in 2007 of lying to investigators and obstruction of justice following the 2003 leak of the covert identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame, though no one was ever charged for the leak. At another point in the hearing, Sessions declined to answer whether he had recused himself from an ongoing Justice Department investigation into Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer. Sessions said he continued to honor his decision from last year to step aside from the investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he said it would be inappropriate beyond that to discuss particular matters he was recused from. \"It is the policy of the Department of Justice that those who recuse themselves not state the details of it, or confirm the existence of an investigation or the scope or nature of that investigation,\" Sessions said. He also said he supported his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel in the Russia investigation and who, like Sessions, has been under steady public attack from the president. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

In the hunt for Odom\u2019s killer, cops hope to also find the answer to the most haunting question about her grotesque death: Why?  Family, friends attend vigil of woman found dismembered in NYC  Brandy Odom was never one to share much about herself. Born Jan. 8, 1992, she grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, as a child of few words, spending afternoons playing with dolls or watching cartoons. \u201cIf it was really serious, then she would express herself,\u201d Odom\u2019s older sister, Aisha, 27, said. \u201cBut otherwise she was quiet. She was really, really quiet.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that Odom was a timid girl. She just preferred to handle things on her own. Perhaps she was taking a cue from her mother, who raised three daughters alone after Odom\u2019s father, James Rodney Newman, passed away from a brain aneurysm when the girls were very young. \u201cI prayed every day to stay strong and raise them the best way that a mother could,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cI always have the memory of when they were children and I would catch them in their rooms playing with their little tea sets,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI was very proud of them.\u201d"]

She was a really bright kid,\u201d Guillen, 32, said. In 2015, Odom enrolled in a six-month program at the Iroquois Job Corps Center in upstate Medina to become a medical administrative assistant.

But there was no one around, so she sprinted home and called 911. When the police arrived, Smith led them to her grisly discovery. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Am I right?

The missile is capable of lofting both conventional and nuclear warheads, the latter to carry out a rapid retaliatory strike, ministry spokesman Wu Qian told reporters at a monthly news briefing. The missile is believed to have a range of up to 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), leaving vulnerable the crucial U.S. military installations on the island of Guam, along with other bases in the region. Despite that, Wu said China remained firm in its defensive military posture, including a policy of never launching a nuclear first strike against an opponent. China's missile force is largely designed to degrade Taiwan's defenses in a move to conquer the self-governing island, while holding off U.S. military support. Included in the arsenal is the DF-21D, which is built to take out an aircraft carrier, and a new air-to-air missile with a range of some 400 kilometers (249 miles) that could attack assets such as early warning aircraft and refueling tankers crucial to U.S. Air Force operations.

The economy in the 19 countries that use the euro currency turned in strong growth of 2.5 percent last year, the best in a decade. But recent economic data has been mixed. If growth shows signs of slowing that could be a reason to extend the bank's 30 billion euros ($36 billion) in bond purchases. The stimulus is set to run at least through September.

Attention will focus instead on Draghi's assessment of recently weaker indicators such as industrial production and more resilient ones such as surveys of business managers.

Cohen, who's concurrently facing a criminal investigation in New York, said in a California court filing that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if he's asked to testify about a $130,000 payment he made to Daniels 11 days before the 2016 election. Daniels says she took the money in exchange for signing a \"hush agreement\" barring her from speaking publicly about having sex with now-President Trump in 2006. \"I first realized that my Fifth Amendment rights would be implicated in this case after I considered the events of April 9,\" Cohen said in the filing, referencing the high-profile FBI raids at his Manhattan office and hotel room, during which a cache of records relating to the Daniels payment were confiscated, including communications with Trump.

According to Piatek's suit filed two months later, the group was denied service \u2014 and ultimately kicked out \u2014 because he wore a MAGA cap. Lawyers for Piatek, 31, argued the Greenwich Village eatery flouted city and state laws barring denial of service based on creed. Paul Liggieri, who repped Piatek in court, contended his client's hat reflected a \"spiritual tribute\" to 9/11 victims \u2014 and he was therefore protected by an anti-discrimination statute. \"Rather than remove his hat, instead he held true to his spiritual belief and was forced from the bar,\" Liggieri claimed. The bar's lawyers said even if Piatek were ejected because of his MAGA hat, the slogan refers to support for Trump and political affiliations aren't protected under the law. Creed, they also argued, alludes to religious belief \u2014 not spiritual feelings about politics."]

["newswires/sports", "Bayern faces future coach as Niko Kovac's Frankfurt visits - NY Daily News MUNICH (AP) \u2014 Bayern Munich will get a good look at its next coach when Eintracht Frankfurt visits for a rehearsal of the German Cup final on Saturday. But Niko Kovac would rather not be the center of attention. Kovac's switch has soured relations between the clubs - even if both now insist that bygones are bygones. \"It's not an issue,\" Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic said after meeting Frankfurt counterpart Fredi Bobic for clear-the-air talks in Frankfurt. Kovac is taking over on a three-year deal from the retiring Jupp Heynckes at the end of the season. He and Salihamidzic are friends after playing two seasons together at Bayern from 2001. In comments that Bayern president Uli Hoeness had labeled as \"outrageous,\" Bobic had been scathing in his criticism after Bayern announced Kovac's signing on April 13, saying it was \"unprofessional and lacking in respect,\" and that the timing was detrimental at the decisive stage of the season. Frankfurt has lost both league games since. Another loss in Munich on Saturday will likely end any lingering Champions League qualification hopes. Kovac has faced criticism for leaving Frankfurt after previously saying he had a contract through 2019 with the club, and he denied having been in contact for weeks with his future club. \"You can believe me or not,\" Kovac told Kicker magazine. The Frankfurt coach said he had a clause inserted into his contract that allowed him leave for a team playing in the Champions League."]
["newswires/sports", "\"I have high expectations of myself. I was convinced that together with the team, I could be interesting for teams in this area. That's why I had the clause put in at the time,\" Kovac said of his contract extension in December 2016. Kovac will face Bayern again for the German Cup final on May 19, when he will hope to go one better after losing to Borussia Dortmund in last year's decider. \"Dreams are the beginning of reality. Everything starts in the head,\" Kovac said, acknowledging Frankfurt will need a major upset - \"the desire and belief in the impossible\" - to deny Bayern another double. Bayern, which wrapped up the league with five games to go, needs to overturn a 2-1 home loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals to maintain its hopes of a treble. Kovac will face a tough challenge to succeed at Bayern, where he will be in charge of established superstars for the first time. At Frankfurt, the 46-year-old Croat was mostly dealing with young and inexperienced players, eager to learn and enthusiastic about working for the team. Kovac, who formerly coached Croatia, was relatively inexperienced when he took over in Frankfurt in March 2016, but he saved the team from relegation and then led it to mid-table and the German Cup final in his second season. This season is his best yet. Bayern no doubt noted how Kovac forged a strong unit from a panel of 17 nationalities based on defensive stability and team commitment - qualities lacking in Bayern's loss to Madrid on Wednesday."]

His dream was put on hold, though, when at the age of five he moved to his mother's home country of Belize. He would return to Brooklyn eight years later and that is when he found his way into to a nearby kickboxing gym. He took a liking to the sport and even compiled a record of 21-1 with 10 KO's before venturing into the famous Gleason's gym. Under the watchful eye of boxing trainer Harry Keitt in 2005, Miller would settle into the sport he craved as a young kid. Now eight years in as a professional boxer, Miller is knocking on the door of stardom and a World title shot. He has a record of 19-0-1 (17 KO's) and he strongly feels his time is now. How much attention is Miller getting? His next bout this Saturday at 10 p.m. on HBO Boxing vs. tough Frenchman, Johann Duhaupas should have the Prime Minister of Belize on hand.

If all goes well Saturday night, Miller sees himself fighting either WBO, IBK and WBA champ Anthony Joshua or WBC champ Wilder in his next. He has his own promotional company, Big Baby Promotions and he is co-promoted by Salita Promotions so he is able to keep an eye on all business moves. Miller feels that his relationship with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport promotions should make it easier to get a fight with Joshua, who works with Matchroom, than with Wilder. In either case, Miller believes neither guy stands a chance against him. \"Big Baby is the total package,\" he said of himself. \"I throw about 80 punches a round and I work the body. Who can stand up to that in the heavyweight division?\" Miller doesn't want to chase any of those guys, but is confident that as long as he continues to win, they will eventually be forced to fight him.

The recalled products, which include Budget $aver Cherry Pineapple Monster Pops and Sugar Free Twin Pops, have the potential of contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria known to cause food poisoning. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1,600 people are infected with listeria each year. Around 260 die from the infection. For otherwise healthy individuals, listeria can cause short-term symptoms such as fever, headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea according to the FDA. For young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, however, infection with listeria can be serious and even fatal. A routine inspection of Ziegenfelder\u2019s Denver production plant discovered listeria on the premises. As a precautionary response, the company has closed the facility to investigate. The ice pops being recalled were sold in packages of 12 and distributed in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

With the average app-based driver working 11.5-hour shifts already, longer shifts will make our streets less safe for everyone. It also takes away the rights of taxi, livery and traditional black-car drivers to work for apps between clients. Ride-hail apps are famous for treating drivers as expendable. Notoriously, they slash our pay with no notice and kick us off their apps for petty reasons, like a rating of 4.4 instead of 4.5.

["newswires/new-york", "Trump lawyer says he'll plead the Fifth in porn actress case - NY Daily News LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's personal attorney said Wednesday he will assert his constitutional right against self-incrimination in a civil case brought by a porn actress who said she had an affair with Trump. Michael Cohen has been asking a federal judge in Los Angeles to delay Stormy Daniels' case after FBI agents raided his home and office earlier this month, seeking records about a nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed days before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and has sued to invalidate the confidentiality agreement that prevents her discussing it. She's also suing Cohen, alleging defamation. Cohen sought to delay the civil case 90 days after the raid, arguing that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination may be jeopardized if legal proceedings aren't stayed. But last week, U.S. District Judge S. James Otero said there were \"gaping holes\" in Cohen's request for a delay. Cohen's lawyer argued in court last week that because the criminal investigation overlaps with issues in the lawsuit, his client's right against self-incrimination could be adversely impacted because he won't be able to respond and defend himself. In a court filing on Wednesday, Cohen said that FBI agents had seized \"various electronic devices and documents in my possession\" which contain information about the $130,000 Daniels was paid as part of the agreement. Agents also seized communications with his lawyer, Brent Blakely, about the civil case, Cohen said."]

Kawhi Leonard is expected to meet with the San Antonio Spurs in the not-so-distant future, assuming that he is medically cleared by his team of doctors. The Knicks should be paying close attention. The most bizarre and unreported story of the NBA season involved Leonard, who four years ago outplayed LeBron James in the NBA Finals and was named Most Valuable Player of the series. The Spurs had their heir apparent to Tim Duncan. Or at least they thought they did. This year, Leonard played in nine games and seemed to spend more quality time with his \u201cgroup\u201d rehabbing his quadriceps injury in Manhattan than he did with his teammates in San Antonio. Although the Spurs doctors had cleared Leonard to resume playing, Leonard\u2019s group, including his own medical staff, advised him to continue rehabbing.  Gregg Popovich to miss Spurs-Warriors Game 3 after wife's death  Not really sure why anyone would think it would be in the best interest of the Spurs to give their franchise player, who turns 27 in June, bad medical advice but if you want to believe that, have at it. For years, the Spurs have been hailed as the gold standard of NBA franchises.

Financially, it makes sense for Leonard to want to remain in San Antonio. The Spurs, though, have a difficult decision on their hands. Do you invest the richest contract in franchise history for a player who didn\u2019t exactly rush back to play this season and who has missed a ton of games over his career? In his first six seasons, Leonard missed 78 games. This year he was out 73. That\u2019s nearly two full seasons of games missed in seven years.

The Spurs may not want to change their ways, but this is Kawhi Leonard we\u2019re talking about.\u201d A meeting between Leonard, Popovich and general manager R.C.

The one major problem, of course, is that Porzingis is currently recovering from major knee surgery and his status for next season is uncertain.

Yet despite Macron's and Merkel's efforts to portray a united European front, the optics of their visits couldn't be more different. While U.S. President Donald Trump received Macron and his wife for a glitzy three-day state visit this week, Merkel gets a 20-minute private chat Friday in the Oval Office followed by a working lunch. And unlike the bonhomie on display during Macron visit, past encounters suggest Merkel and Trump won't be putting on a show of mutual affection for the White House cameras. That should be fine with Merkel, who has little to gain back home by being overly friendly with Trump, according to German political analyst Jan Techau. \"For Merkel, it's quite important domestically not to be seen to be getting too close to Trump,\" said Techau, a senior fellow at think tank The German Marshall Fund of the United States. Anti-American sentiment has been growing again in Germany since Trump's election, with mainstream media regularly portraying the U.S. president as a threat to the world. But Merkel, who responded to Trump's \"America First\" message by saying that \"we in Europe have to take our fate into our own hands,\" knows she needs to find a way to win over the U.S. president or risk a further decline in relations between Berlin and Washington, said Techau."]

Two deadlines loom large ahead of her trip: the first is Trump's demand for an overhaul by May 12 of the nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 an agreement that Germany, like France, worked hard to secure and believes should remain in place. Although Germany is unlikely to accept a wholesale rewrite of the deal, Berlin has indicated that it's prepared to consider add-ons that would crack down on Tehran's ballistic missile program and curb Iranian efforts to strengthen its strategic role in the Middle East. The second deadline concerns the extension of new U.S. tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum, which some fear could trigger a global wave of protectionism that would deeply harm a trading nation such as Germany. \"The threatened punitive taxes will be a tough test of the trans-Atlantic relationship,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of Germany's influential BDI industrial lobby group. \"In Germany, every fourth job depends on exports. In the industrial sectors, it's more than every second job.\" Merkel's aides sought to play down expectations that her U.S. visit will result in a breakthrough on the trade issue. A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with department rules, said the German government expects the exemption Trump granted the European Union from new U.S. import tariffs on steel and aluminum to expire on May 1."]

It remains to be seen whether Merkel's facts-and-figures approach will be more successful than Macron's charm offensive. The French president got plenty of warm handshakes and standing ovations during his trip to Washington, but the overall verdict back home was more sober. \"He passed the test,\" said RTL radio commentator Olivier Mazerolle. Le Parisien said ultimately \"nothing budged\" in the two president's disputes over the Middle East or on climate change. Still, Macron's attacks on Trump policies during his speech to Congress haven't yet sparked a nasty tweet from the U.S. president. After the speech, Macron insisted that their relationship \"on a personal and national level is excellent.\" Merkel, meanwhile, has subtly shifted her stance on two issues that are important to the United States.

More than 30 million Americans have this disease, tripling their chances of heart attack and stroke. In the United States, diabetes is also the leading cause of adult blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic foot amputations. Diabetes occurs when there is too much glucose, or sugar, in the bloodstream. Having prediabetes means that you have a blood sugar level that is higher than normal, but not quite high enough to be considered diabetes. About Diabetes The excess blood sugar in diabetes is caused by problems with how the body produces or uses insulin, a hormone that transfers the sugar from the bloodstream into the body's cells for nourishment. Everyone needs some sugar, but too much of it in the bloodstream damages the arteries, kidneys, eyes, and nerves over time. Diabetes is generally classified as type 1 or type 2, although our research shows that there are probably several subtypes: Type 1 diabetes. With type 1 diabetes, formerly known as juvenile diabetes, people's bodies do not make enough insulin to manage the sugar. Taking insulin is the only treatment for this class of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is thought to be an autoimmune reaction and is unrelated to obesity or prediabetes."]
["life-style", "Type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells are resistant to the effects of insulin and so need more and more of it to properly clear the bloodstream of sugar. This is known as insulin resistance. Over time, the cells that make insulin become exhausted and stop working properly. Prediabetes refers to the susceptibility of developing this type of diabetes. More than 90% of all Americans who have diabetes have type 2. There are many things that make developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes more likely, such as family history and age, but obesity is the No. 1 risk factor. A history of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) and giving birth to a baby weighing more than nine pounds are also significant risk factors. You can calculate your risk with a user-friendly online tool provided by the American Diabetes Association. Testing. Most people are unaware they have diabetes or prediabetes unless they are tested for it. The same tests are used to detect both conditions: Hemoglobin A1c test, a blood test that estimates your average blood sugar for the last three months; Fasting blood sugar test, which checks your blood sugar at a single point in time after you fast overnight; Oral glucose tolerance test, which indicates how much your blood sugar, increases a certain amount of time after you drink a sugar solution. At your next physical, ask your doctor if you should be tested, and he or she will determine which one is right for you."]
["life-style", "Preventing Diabetes Doctors might be arguing over the best blood sugar target for patients with diabetes, but they all agree on one thing: The earlier you catch elevated blood sugar, the easier it is to turn back the clock. It has been clinically proven that those with prediabetes who participate in a structured lifestyle change program can drastically reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes \u2014 by 58% or more. In fact, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recognizing and promoting such programs, and Medicare will start covering them in mid-2018. Lifestyle changes include eating healthier, getting more physical activity, and decreasing stress. The key is integrating these changes into your daily life, rather than, say, going on a crash diet or occasionally taking an intense exercise class. Some people with prediabetes can also benefit from a generic medication called metformin, which has been in use for decades. An inexpensive drug with few side effects, it is recommended in combination with lifestyle changes to help prevent diabetes. Tips for Success Changing your eating habits, activity levels and daily routine can be difficult. Here are a few tips that may help you succeed: Join a lifestyle change program. Learn to build new habits with the support of a group of people with similar goals. You can find a class near you through the CDC website. The YMCA also offers diabetes prevention programs across the country."]
["life-style", "Partner with a professional. Working with a health coach or dietitian can be very helpful in making prudent and lasting changes in your diet. Check in with them, even if it is just a phone call for 15 minutes once a week, to set goals and discuss barriers. I recommend taking photos of everything you eat and drink, and sharing them at your first meeting. In addition, people who associate comfort with food may benefit from seeing a mental health professional who can help them find healthier ways to stimulate the reward center in the brain. Focus on physical activity. Increasing your physical activity doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym. Choose an activity that you can work into everyday life, like brisk walking. For instance, if you take public transportation, get off one stop early and walk the rest of the way. If you drive, park in the farthest part of the parking lot. If you have a favorite TV show, watch it at the gym or on your treadmill, rather than on the couch while snacking. When it comes to exercise, working out with a personal trainer or exercise buddy, such as a friend or neighbor, can help motivate you and keep you on track. In addition to getting cardiovascular exercise, it is important to build muscle mass when possible, as muscle burns calories even when you are at rest. If you suffer from knee or ankle pain while walking or doing other weight-bearing exercise, try swimming instead, which is easier on the joints."]

Lamar Davenport, 33, is charged with the Aug. 16, 2015, murder of his girlfriend E'Dena Hines, outside their building on W. 162nd St. in Washington Heights. Davenport straddled Hines, 33, and stabbed her 25 times, according to trial evidence. \"He had the capacity to have a conscious objective or purpose to kill, to cause her death,\" forensic psychiatrist Jason Hershberger said in Manhattan Supreme Court. Hershberger said Davenport took the hallucinogenic even though he had bad reactions to it, including crazed behavior and blackouts. \"In the absence of intoxicants he is a normal man with a normal mental status,\" the doctor added. Defense lawyers argue that Davenport should be found not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect because of the drug-induced psychosis. Prosecutors say he is guilty and should be held accountable for the crime. Hines was the daughter of a child adopted by Freeman during his first marriage."]

Fiat Chrysler maintained its guidance for full-year earnings, saying it still expects net revenue of about 125 billion euros.

["newswires/news/national", "Ronny Jackson withdraws from consideration for VA chief - NY Daily News WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 White House doctor Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration as Veterans Affairs secretary on Thursday, saying \"false allegations\" against him have become a distraction. In a statement the White House issued from Jackson, he said he \"did not expect to have to dignify baseless and anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.\" Jackson faced a series of accusations about his workplace conduct, including that he exhibited a pattern of recklessly prescribing drugs and drunken behavior. The latest blow to his nomination to lead the government's second-largest Cabinet agency came Wednesday with a set of accusations compiled by Democratic staff on the committee considering his nomination. Based on conversations with 23 of Jackson's current and former colleagues at the White House Medical Unit, the summary said Jackson exhibited a pattern of recklessly prescribing drugs and drunken behavior, including crashing a government vehicle while intoxicated and doling out such a large supply of a prescription opioid that staffers panicked because they thought the drugs were missing. In just a matter of days, the allegations transformed Jackson's reputation as a celebrated doctor attending the president to an embattled nominee accused of drinking on the job and over-prescribing drugs. He was seen pacing back and forth on the White House grounds Wednesday. Jackson huddled late Wednesday evening with top White House press staff. They declined to comment on the situation."]
["newswires/news/national", "A former colleague who spoke to The Associated Press described Jackson as a gregarious, Type A charmer who knew how to position himself for success \u2014 attentive to bosses but also causing unnecessary grief and consternation among colleagues. He said Jackson became known as \"Candyman\" because of the way he handed out drugs. The ex-colleague spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation. The \"Candyman\" nickname was also cited in the summary released by the Democrats. In a section on Jackson's prescribing practices, the summary said that in one case, missing Percocet tabs threw members of the White House Medical Unit into a panic \u2014 but it turned out he had prescribed a \"large supply\" of the opioid to a White House Military Office staffer. The allegations also referred to multiple incidents of Jackson's intoxication while on duty, often on overseas trips. On at least one occasion he was nowhere to be found when his medical help was needed because \"he was passed out drunk in his hotel room,\" according to the summary. At a Secret Service going-away party, the summary says, Jackson got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle. Jackson has denied allegations of bad behavior. \"I never wrecked a car,\" he said. \"I have no idea where that is coming from.\" Reports of overprescribing and alcohol-related behavior problems can jeopardize a doctor's license. Many state medical boards allow doctors to keep their licenses and return to practice if they complete special treatment programs and submit to random urine screens."]
["newswires/news/national", "The allegations were publicly released on the day that Jackson's confirmation hearing was to have been held. The hearing was postponed indefinitely while the allegations against him are reviewed. \"He treated the people above him very, very well. He treated the people below him very, very poorly,\" Sen. Jon Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, told the AP. \"It's not surprising the people above him think he was doing a really, really good job.\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that Jackson had passed \"at least four independent background checks\" that found \"no areas of concern.\" \"He has received more vetting than most nominees,\" she said. Marc Short, the White House legislative director, could not say he was confident the allegations were false. He was \"not familiar\" with car wreck episode. But Short also suggested Tester was airing the allegations for political gain. \"It's quite unusual for a United States senator to take allegations that have not been fully investigated, but to flaunt them to the national public to suggest he's the 'candyman' I think is outrageous,\" Short said. Tester, speaking on MSNBC, acknowledged that not all the allegations had been verified. \"Am I 100% rock solid sure that he did this? No,\" Tester said. \"But I've seen a pattern here that continues on and on and on.\" Veterans groups are dismayed over the continuing uncertainty at the VA, already beset by infighting over improvements to veterans care."]
["newswires/news/national", "\"The American Legion is very concerned about the current lack of permanent leadership,\" said Denise Rohan, national commander of The American Legion, the nation's largest veterans organization. A watchdog report requested in 2012 and reviewed by the AP found that Jackson and a rival physician exhibited \"unprofessional behaviors\" as they engaged in a power struggle over the White House medical unit. That report by the Navy's Medical Inspector General found a lack of trust in the leadership and low morale among staff members, who described the working environment as \"being caught between parents going through a bitter divorce.\" It included no references to improper prescribing of drugs or the use of alcohol, as alleged in the summary compiled by the Senate Democratic staff members. The White House has released handwritten reports from Trump and former President Barack Obama praising Jackson's leadership and medical care and recommending him for promotion. Trump's first VA secretary, David Shulkin, was dismissed after an ethics scandal and mounting rebellion within the agency. But Jackson has faced numerous questions from lawmakers and veterans groups about whether he has the experience to manage the department of 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans. ___ Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Lisa Mascaro, Ken Thomas, Matthew Daly and Jill Colvin in Washington and AP Medical Writer Carla K.

FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE. Longtime guard Chris Snee, who retired last summer after a stellar career with the Giants, heads the list. A second-round pick in 2004, he went on to play 10 seasons, missing only 19 games and developing into the backbone of the great Giants lines of the early 2000s. Defensive end Osi Umenyiora, who signed a one-year deal with the Giants just last month to retire with the club that drafted him, is also entering the ring.

["sports/hockey", "Clemens' pal denies NHL players' allegations - NY Daily News Golf course developer Ken Jowdy, who was sued on Thursday by a group of 19 current and former NHL players seeking millions of dollars they had invested with him, says he would have preferred they had just picked up the telephone and called him to discuss the status of the projects. \"I'd love to talk to them,\" Jowdy told the Daily News. \"I'd be thrilled to pick up the phone and invite them to come there and play a round of golf.\"  A close friend of embattled pitcher Roger Clemens, Jowdy strongly denies the salacious claims in two lawsuits filed simultaneously in Los Angeles on Thursday which assert that Jowdy misused millions of dollars of the plaintiffs' money intended for golf-course developments on the Baja peninsula and Cabo San Lucas on lavish parties and private plane rides for baseball players and other athletes and friends.  \"The claims are outrageous and they aren't true,\" Jowdy said. \"We have had four promotional weekends since 2003, and all have been attended by baseball players, hockey players, wives, girlfriends and prospects. The only reason that my friends are mentioned was in order to gain the most publicity possible, and to hurt me the most.\" "]
["sports/hockey", "According to the lawsuit, Jowdy used the hockey players' money to purchase private planes to ferry notables such as Roger Clemens, Reggie Jackson, Pete Rose and Joe Morgan around the country; threw parties for the athletes and other clients, complete with \"porn stars, escorts, strippers, party girls and other women\"; and provided athletes and other friends with \"gratuitous extravagant private air travel, five-star hotel accommodations, luxury home rentals, unlimited food and beverage expenses, golf tournaments and lavish parties several times a year.\"  Jowdy denies all that. \"Roger Clemens, Reggie Jackson, Joe Morgan and Pete Rose are all friends of mine. They've taken time out of their schedules, at my request, to attend functions in Mexico to promote our projects,\" he told The News. \"They have been gracious with their time and efforts in showing support to me, and have been gracious in playing golf and socializing with prospective buyers. At no time have they ever participated in, or has there ever existed, parties with hookers, strippers or porn stars.\"  Ronald Richards, the California attorney who filed the suit on behalf of the hockey players, told the Daily News that he has photographs that support allegations that Jowdy squandered the hockey players' money on wild parties, although he acknowledged the photos did not prove anything illegal or unseemly occurred. But the main issue, he said, is that Jowdy blew his clients' money and has nothing to show for it. "]
["sports/hockey", "Jowdy claims he has barely met the plaintiffs, who he says made their investments via his business-partner-turned nemesis Phil Kenner, who he says blocked all access to the hockey players. Jowdy says Kenner, an Arizona businessman who calls himself a \"lifestyle coach\" and has served as a financial adviser to many of the athletes who are plaintiffs in the case, is behind the lawsuit.  It is Kenner, according to Jowdy, who has not looked out for his clients' interest. \"It has everything to do with Kenner,\" Jowdy says. \"I'm just a target right now.\" As The News reported in April, Kenner is himself snagged in a thicket of litigation related to his financial transactions with NHL stars, and is the target of a lawsuit filed by former NHL star Joe Juneau and an arbitration action by Minnesota Wild right wing Owen Nolan.  Jowdy's lawyers are expected to move to dismiss the case next week, but according to a source familiar with both parties, it would not be surprising if the federal government ended up investigating the matter.  According to Jowdy, the claims in the lawsuits that he has \"failed to execute even the most fundamental elements of a business or development plan\" in Cabo and Baja are erroneous and were contradicted in a deposition he gave on May 27 in a suit against Kenner filed by Nolan. Richards, the same lawyer representing the NHL players in the two lawsuits against Jowdy, attempted to show in that deposition that not only was Jowdy \"working very hard to (A) develop the property, or (B), wait until the economy turns around and try to sell it at a profit,\" he fully intended to get a return on Nolan's investment, even without charging the investment group for his work. "]
["sports/hockey", "\"In fact,\" Richards asked Jowdy in the deposition, \"you're still working - you're not charging the LLC to currently try to develop this property, are you?\" Richards asked.  \"No,\" Jowdy replied.  \"You're still trying to save Mr. Nolan's money along with Mr. Kenner and along with everybody else, correct?\" asked Richards.  \"Yes,\" Jowdy answered.  Richards said he was trying to show that Jowdy had led Kenner to believe that the project was moving forward.  Jowdy also disputes the claim in the lawsuit that he is the subject of an arrest warrant in Mexico. According to Jowdy's Mexican attorney, Fernando Garcia, authorities have confirmed in writing that there is no arrest warrant for his client.  \"That's not the information I have,\" Richards countered.  Until about two years ago, when their partnership soured, Kenner raised money for the exclusive golf developments Jowdy was trying to establish in Mexico, bringing in players who put in six-figure investments adding up to about $20 million.  Jowdy says that while the Baja project is on hold, the \"value is still there, the land is still there. This is not like a (Bernie) Madoff thing, where there is just nothing.\" He added that the Cabo course is on schedule to open in October and that he would \"love for the players to come to Cabo and play a round on it now.\" "]
["sports/hockey", "\"If these guys and Phil Kenner wanted to document what they have invested, I'm sure they could get it out in 60 days,\" Jowdy said. \"In today's real estate market, there's not a lot of deals where you can have your investment back after three years. If any of his players want their money taken out, I can have it out in 60 days.\"  Jowdy says big entertainment budgets are a necessary part of establishing an exclusive golf resort, and that his budget is well within industry standards. \"It's not fun to deal with this stuff,\" he said, \"but I don't think we did anything wrong or misappropriated any funds. For us to still be in business after two years of dealing with (Kenner), is to be commended.\"  Richards said he welcomed Jowdy's offer to refund his clients' money.  \"If Jowdy wants to return his money let's see proof of funds,\" Richards said. \"Lets see if he returns the money in 60 days. If he returns the money, great.\""]

D\u2019Amato United States Courthouse. He testified in a monotone, almost robotic voice that sounded restrained for a man who believes he has been falsely accused of stealing millions of dollars and damaging dozens of investors\u2019 lives. But his testimony may have raised doubts among the jurors. NHL star Owen Nolan had testified that he was unaware that a line of credit Kenner had established for him would be used for a real estate deal, but Kenner said he faxed Nolan a 39-page document in 2003 explaining where the money would go and then produced a fax cover page that corroborated his testimony. Still, Kenner, who returns to the witness stand on Thursday, has not explained why so many longtime friends and clients would provide false testimony in a case that could send him to prison for years. By the time prosecutors Miskiewicz and Saritha Komatireddy rested Tuesday, they had presented testimony from hockey players and other alleged victims, as well as evidence such as bank statements and other documents, that painted Kenner and his longtime wingman Tommy Constantine as relentless and rapacious financial predators. The case not only underscores the problems wealthy but na\u00efve athletes have as they struggle to manage the millions of dollars they earn, but the betrayal in this case is especially sharp. Juneau, for example, was Kenner\u2019s college teammate and roommate; they were the best man at each other\u2019s weddings.\u00a0"]

Researchers with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University have found CTE in 87 of 91 former NFL players tested, PBS\u2019 Frontline reported Friday. In total, the researchers found CTE in 131 of 165 players who played for pro, semipro, college and high school teams. \u201cPeople think that we\u2019re blowing this out of proportion, that this is a very rare disease and that we\u2019re sensationalizing it,\u201d said Ann McKee, the director of the National VA ALS Brain Bank, a collaboration between the VA and BU. \u201cMy response is that where I sit, this is a very real disease. We have no problem in identifying it in hundreds of players.\u201d FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE. CTE is believed to come from repetitive blows to the head, and football players are especially at risk because of the thousands of hits they suffer in practices and games during their careers. The repeated shots to the head damage nerve fibers, which release proteins that pool in the brain and kill cells in regions that regulate emotions and critical thinking. Forty percent of those who tested positive were offensive or defensive linemen, players who are hit on virtually every play of a game."]
["amp/sports/football", "CTE has been linked to dementia, memory loss, depression and other conditions. Frontline noted that the figures come with a caveat: Players who donated their brains for research most likely suspected that they had the disease, leaving researchers with a skewed population of subjects. \u201cWe are dedicated to making football safer and continue to take steps to protect players, including rule changes, advanced sideline technology, and expanded medical resources,\u201d an NFL spokesman said. In its 2015 Health and Safety Report, the NFL said concussions dropped 35%, from 173 in 2012 to 112 in 2014. Frontline disputed that claim, saying an analysis of information reported by teams during the preseason shows a smaller decrease of 28%. In court papers filed last year in connection to a class-action head trauma lawsuit brought by former players, the NFL acknowledged that it expects about a third of its retirees will develop long-term cognitive problems. A federal judge in April granted approval to a $1 billion settlement to that case in April, although many players have opted out. The NFL donated $1 million to McKee\u2019s lab in 2010, but the league attempted for years to refute any links between football and brain disease. The NFL\u2019s Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee concluded in a series of scientific papers released between 2003 and 2009 that pro football players \u201cdo not sustain frequent repetitive blows to the brain.\u201d"]

The film focuses on Bennet Omalu, the neurosurgeon who first linked CTE to repetitive head trauma. League doctors publicly assailed Omalu\u2019s work and demanded a retraction of an article he wrote for a medical journal.

CTE is believed to come from repetitive blows to the head, and football players are especially at risk because of the thousands of hits they suffer in practices and games during their careers. The repeated shots to the head damage nerve fibers, which release proteins that pool in the brain and kill cells in regions that regulate emotions and critical thinking. Forty percent of those who tested positive were offensive or defensive linemen, players who are hit on virtually every play of a game. CTE has been linked to dementia, memory loss, depression and other conditions. Frontline noted that the figures come with a caveat: Players who donated their brains for research most likely suspected that they had the disease, leaving researchers with a skewed population of subjects. \u201cWe are dedicated to making football safer and continue to take steps to protect players, including rule changes, advanced sideline technology, and expanded medical resources,\u201d an NFL spokesman said. In its 2015 Health and Safety Report, the NFL said concussions dropped 35%, from 173 in 2012 to 112 in 2014. Frontline disputed that claim, saying an analysis of information reported by teams during the preseason shows a smaller decrease of 28%. In court papers filed last year in connection to a class-action head trauma lawsuit brought by former players, the NFL acknowledged that it expects about a third of its retirees will develop long-term cognitive problems. A federal judge in April granted approval to a $1 billion settlement to that case in April, although many players have opted out."]

["sports/i-team", "Hockey scammer pleads not guilty to felony charges - NY Daily News One of the men charged with stealing millions of dollars from a dozen current and former National Hockey League players and several Long Island police officers appeared in U.S. District court in Central Islip Wednesday, a far different man than the one who only a month ago lived in a lavish Scottsdale compound and traveled by private jet, all the while continuing to solicit money from gullible players. Phil Kenner, who was arrested on Nov. 13 in Scottsdale along with his partner, former race car driver Tommy Constantine, was arraigned in federal court Wednesday wearing blue prison garb, stubble covering his face, his hair a bizarre mass of slicked back gray and black curls in front and platinum blonde in back. The men, who were indicted by a grand jury convened in the Eastern District of New York following a four-year investigation by the FBI, have been charged with multiple counts of wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy in a con that lasted more than a decade. They face 15 to 17 years in prison if convicted. Both are being held without bail. \"He (Kenner) was as pale as I've ever seen a human still breathing,\" said one attorney who attended the proceeding. \"He looked non-human.\" When asked how he would plead, Kenner, who was represented by a public defender, whispered, \"Not guilty.\""]
["sports/i-team", "The lawyer told U.S. District Court Judge Joseph F. Bianco that Kenner was not ready to fill out a bail application; Bianco cited an Arizona judge's ruling calling Kenner a flight risk and a danger to witnesses as the reason for holding him without bail. The arrests of the men brought to a close a long and difficult investigation that relied largely on the determination of former Ranger and Islander Bryan Berard and former New York police officer John Kaiser, along with New York-based FBI agent Matt Galioto, to indict Kenner and Constantine. Among the alleged victims was Berard, the former No. 1 NHL draft pick who later lost an eye in a gruesome on-ice accident and fought his way back to the NHL. The scam is alleged to have involved former Islander Michael Peca, former Ranger Mattias Norstrom, Jere Lehtinen of the Dallas Stars and NHL journeymen Glen Murray and Jozef Stumpel, among several other players. The prominent New York law firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady will represent one of the hockey players, who will pursue civil options against Kenner. \"The fraud here is massive and it involves financial institutions as well,\" said attorney Earl Ward, a partner with ECBA. Meanwhile, Bianco ruled last month that Constantine should remain in custody until the judge can determine if he is a flight risk. A magistrate judge in Arizona ruled on Nov. 18 that although Constantine also represented a flight risk, he could be released prior to trial on a $500,000 bond secured by the Scottsdale home where his mother and disabled brother now live. New York prosecutors asked the Central Islip federal judge to revoke the magistrate's order."]
["sports/i-team", "Constantine's attorney, Edward J.M. Little, told Bianco at a Nov. 21 hearing in Central Islip that Constantine was unlikely to flee before trial. He said Constantine remained in the country even when he knew that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had been investigating allegations that Kenner and Constantine had defrauded the NHL players. In fact, Little said, Constantine attempted to cooperate with the investigation. \"Mr. Constantine's mother and his physically disabled brother, who is epileptic, live there,\" Little said. \"And the idea that he would flee and render his own family homeless is hard to imagine. \"In addition, he supports his girlfriend-fiance, who is pregnant with their son. The baby is due in March. And he also helps her raise her 10-year-old from a previous marriage,\" Little added. Little also noted that if Constantine remains in custody, he will have to be transported to New York via a prison bus, a trip that could take up to two weeks. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Carrie Capwell told Bianco that Constantine has traveled extensively to Mexico and would not have to produce a passport if he crosses the border by car from Arizona. Constantine also has a friend in the Bahamas, Capwell said, and he told one victim that he has family in Greece and could move there if necessary. Constantine also has numerous contacts in the private aircraft industry. \"We believe it would be very easy for Mr. Constantine to flee,\" Capwell said."]

The home Constantine claims is worth $500,000 was purchased by his mother in 2012 for $170,000 and placed in a revocable trust. Constantine also told the federal Pretrial Service that he has earned $5,000 a month since 2009 with Arizona Falcon Partners, an aviation company. But Constantine testified after filing for bankruptcy that he did not have any income. \"Mr. Constantine's sworn testimony given at the detention hearing on basic income questions shows a lack of truthfulness,\" Prewitt's attorneys wrote."]

At the hearing Thursday, her lawyers said she's a remorseful first-time offender who never meant to share the photo publicly and quickly apologized. \"If anyone is deserving of (diversion) it would be someone like Ms. Mathers who inadvertently, on accident, did a bad thing,\" defense lawyer Dana Cole argued. \"There was no intent on her part. She pushed the wrong button. She's done everything possible to demonstrate remorse and take it back.

It was March 29, 2011, Peca said, and he was testifying before a federal grand jury investigating his financial adviser, Phil Kenner, a smooth-talking guru who had handled Peca\u2019s retirement savings since 1996. Over the years, Kenner had convinced more than a dozen NHL players to trust him with their millions. But Peca hadn\u2019t known until that day that Kenner was the grand jury\u2019s target. In fact, he\u2019d spent the previous night preparing for his testimony with Kenner\u2019s former attorney, Ron Richards.

At one point he said he was hiding in a cave in Mexico.\u201d Out of fear that she would never see her family\u2019s nest egg again, Kristin Peca began recording her phone calls with Kenner in 2012.

["sports/i-team", "\u201cI don\u2019t have anything,\u201d Kenner says on one of the tapes, when Kristin Peca asks if he has any documentation for a line of credit he\u2019d managed in their names. The account was in default, and the Northern Trust bank had taken the Pecas\u2019 stocks and bonds that had been held as collateral. \u201cSome of it went to land deals, some of it went to operating expenses,\u201d Kenner says on the tape. Then prosecutors handed Kristin Peca a loan transaction history report related to the account, showing that Kenner had used their money to finance the purchase of a $750,000 home in Sag Harbor. Kristin Peca\u2019s head swiveled and she cast a disgusted look at the defense table where Kenner sat without expression. (He has been in federal custody since his arrest in November of 2013.) In the taped calls, Kenner told the Pecas that the real villain was Jowdy, a golf course developer who in recent years launched Diamante Cabo San Lucas, a lavish resort featuring a course designed by Tiger Woods. The resort is considered a success, fully endorsed by the banks that underwrote it, but it was still in development in 2009, when Kenner convinced the players to join a blockbuster lawsuit against Jowdy. To that end, the players were asked in 2009 to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to what Kenner called the Global Settlement Fund, or GSF \u2014 a $5 million war chest purportedly intended to finance a lawsuit and public relations campaign against Jowdy."]

In essence the GSF, according to the government, was a way for Kenner and Constantine to double-down on their previous frauds, and extract one last measure of wealth from their clients. The fund was set up as an escrow managed by Richards, who in an email to The News on Thursday defended it. \u201cThose funds were deposited into my client trust account and I am obligated by law to disburse those funds upon the client\u2019s request,\u201d Richards said, \u201cwhich I did.\u201d"]

We hope to be consistent throughout the whole season.\" MEHTA: FOR JETS, BEATING COLTS ALL COMES DOWN TO LUCK Although the Jets didn't rack up mind-boggling numbers in the three-touchdown rout of the Browns in Week 1, there were enough encouraging signs to think that maybe Gailey has the right pieces to help snap a four-year playoff drought. Ryan Fitzpatrick made smart decisions (minus one interception that was quickly erased by Brandon Marshall's heady strip and fumble recovery) and leaned on a trio of veterans to generate points. It was a winning formula that everyone in green-and-white hopes to replicate over the next four months."]
["sports/football/jets", "\"We have the ability pass-run to be threatening every game,\" Decker said. \"It's up to us as players to execute. We got a lot of smart guys in that room and some savvy guys up front (on the offensive line). Fitzpatrick's been around. Brandon Marshall's been around the game a lot. Chris Ivory's been around. So you got a lot of guys who have played a lot of football and know what our job is. So if we can just execute it, I think we can be a very good offense complementary a very good defense that we got.\" Todd Bowles' offense finished what his defense started. The Jets scored 21 points off five turnovers to kick off the Bowles era in style. Bowles' defense entered the season with high expectations. His offense was largely an unknown before he had to go to Plan B due to a locker room fight that shelved Geno Smith with a broken jaw."]

Federal prosecutors and defense attorneys watched closely Monday as Bianco questioned about 200 people summoned to the Alphonse M. D\u2019Amato United States Courthouse for jury duty. The resulting panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was a cross section of Long Island, including a self-described \u201chockey mom\u201d and people with no interest in the sport at all.

Phil Kenner and Tommy Constantine, who have both pleaded not guilty to fraud and money-laundering charges, made appearances at the U.S. District Court in Central Islip on Wednesday. Since their arrest in late 2013, Kenner has been held at a Queens prison while Constantine, out on bail, has been under house arrest in Arizona. In the status conference Wednesday, prosecutors said they will need four weeks to present a case they say will show that Kenner and Constantine stole millions from more than a dozen current and former NHL players, as well as a group of New York policemen and others. District Court Judge Joseph Bianco set a date of April 28 for the start of jury selection in the trial. If convicted, both men could face more than 10 years in prison.

It was the best hometown story in the Super Bowl, and it centered on the unlikeliest player in the game, and it played out across the street from a bail-bonds store and an abandoned building, and right next door to a Laundromat. It played out behind the rich, burnished wooden door of a place called Jacksonville, a well-kept bar with a handsome brick wall in the front, and a party room and solarium in the back, and every single person on staff \u2014 maybe two dozen of them \u2014wearing blue No. 80 Victor Cruz T-shirts.  You wouldn't expect such an upscale place in such a downscale part of North Jersey, but then, who expected to find Paterson's Victor Cruz, or the New York Giants, in the Super Bowl? The slogan of Jacksonville is \"Unlimited Possibilities.\" It's right on the sign out front and speaks to the essence of what Super Bowl XLVI meant to Cruz's hometown, and to the hundreds who gathered in a bar on Grand St. Sunday night to cheer him on \u2014 a crowd that included Jeffrey Jones, the mayor of Paterson; U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) and Mike Adams, the Cleveland Browns cornerback."]

He grew up in Paterson, a couple of first downs from Victor Cruz. Twelve years ago, Alvaro Llanos was horribly burned in the Seton Hall dormitory fire, spent three months in a coma and needed 30 surgeries to patch himself together. He said Cruz inspired him, the way he has become as unlikely a star as there is in football, Everyman in a No. 80 jersey, an undrafted free agent out of UMass and Paterson Catholic. Llanos, of course, knows a little bit about long shots, and surviving them. \"If you are patient and you work hard, you get where you want to go in life,\" Alvaro Llanos said. When Cruz juggled, and caught, a two-yard slant for the game's first touchdown late in the first quarter, the roar was so loud at Jacksonville you might've heard it at Lucas Oil Stadium, or at least in Clifton. People leapt from chairs, salsa-danced in the aisles. A big man in a Yankee hat commandeered a microphone. He wore a Yankee hat and looked a lot like Jay-Z. \"Paterson, New Jersey is in the building,\" he thundered. By night's end the salsa dancing was beyond belief at Jacksonville, starting the instant Ahmad Bradshaw tumbled into the end zone at about 9:44 p.m. A big-muscled bartender named Eladio Portalatin jumped on the stage and started to dance in his Cruz T-shirt, and about 150 people left their seats and started dancing right along with him."]
["sports/football/giants", "The only way it could've been more insane is if the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl was scored by their own Victor Cruz, who wound up catching just four balls for 25 yards, and spent the whole night under smothering Patriot double-teams, helping to free up Hakeem Nicks and Mario Manningham. Nobody was complaining, least of all Mike Jackson. Mike Jackson, former star quarterback at Kennedy High School in town who went on to play in the Canadian Football League and the Arena Football League, is the owner of Jacksonville. He did most all of the demolition and renovations himself. He was wearing a signed Cruz Giants jersey, and was about to auction one off in a halftime raffle, not long before the Patriots took control of the game, and a 17-9 lead. It wasn't how Mike Jackson saw the game unfolding, but it didn't alter his larger point. \"To me, Victor is the perfect reflection of Paterson,\" Jackson said. \"He's resilient, and he's tough and he doesn't give in.\" The sensation that Victor Cruz has become is a well-known narrative in this struggling city of 150,000 people and scores of nationalities, hard by the Passaic River. He grew up on East 18th St., about 2\u00bd miles from Sunday night's party. He was a receiving standout and even better at basketball at Paterson Catholic, before he convinced the Giants to give him a look and wound up setting receiving records, and catching 10 balls for 142 yards in the NFC title game against the 49ers."]

Cruz signed every piece of paper, and took every picture anybody wanted. \"When it's (needed) the most, somebody breaks through and does something special, and it means so much,\" Pascrell said. Mike Jackson and Mayor Jeffrey Jones talked about all the talented people Paterson has produced, from Rory Sparrow to Tim Thomas in the NBA, to Mike Adams and NFL twins Ricardo and Devon McDonald, to Jackson's own brother, Stanley Jackson, former Ohio State and CFL quarterback. Mike Jackson wanted to prove that a well-appointed restaurant and bar could flourish in his hometown. Jones suggested looking beyond the vacant lots and debris, and seeing the quality of people. \"Good things do grow here, and that's the important message,\" Jones said. Six hundred and fifty miles to the west, at Lucas Oil, the Super Bowl ended with Giant delirium, and it was no different at Jacksonville. John Feliciano, a 52-year-old contractor, was an assistant coach at Paterson Catholic when Cruz starred there.

The effort seeks to raise several million dollars to unseat six New York House Republicans, sources with knowledge of the plan said. The six GOPers being targeted are Lee Zeldin (Suffolk County), John Faso (Columbia County), Elise Stefanik (Essex County in the Adirondacks), Claudia Tenney (Oneida County), Tom Reed (Steuben County in the Southern Tier) and Chris Collins (Erie County). It\u2019s the first time Cuomo, who is up for reelection in 2018 and has been mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential candidate, is actively involving himself in the effort to flip control of the House. The inspiration was the recent House vote for the health care bill backed by President Trump, which Cuomo has said could cost the state $7 billion, sources said. He was particularly upset with Faso and Collins, who sponsored an amendment that would shift billions of dollars in local Medicaid costs onto the state. A source close to the effort said the campaign will not only point out to people in the districts how their representatives voted, but also what it could cost them. \u201cOur feeling is, these (six) were elected by the people of the State of New York, but instead of fighting for those people, they are doing the opposite,\u201d the source said."]

["news/politics", "Revenge porn is now a specific crime in the UK\u00a0 The UK has passed new legislation that punishes revenge porn with prison. As of Monday, UK's Criminal Justice and Court Act considers revenge porn as a specific crime. If someone publicly posts racy images of their ex without consent and with the intent to cause distress, they'll face up to two years in jail, opposed to the current six months. Prior to this act, revenge porn offenders could be prosecuted under different laws but with the creation of a specific offense, authorities will be able to get the message across offenders. The act will consider sharing photos online and offline as a crime. The act will also increase the maximum penalty for Internet trolls who send abusive messages. Their penalty will now be two years in prison. Along with punishing online offenders, the act will also make it illegal for jurors to disobey a judge's instructions and research details of the case. Twitter recently also joined the fight to stop abusive behavior online and decrease the amount of revenge porn on its platform. The social network put a ban on all intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without consent. Facebook and Reddit have also put bans on revenge porn and other intimate photos."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "Maybe it's time for Mets' Collins to take his own advice on Bruce - NY Daily News WASHINGTON \u2014 In explaining his lineup before Wednesday\u2019s game, specifically the presence of T.J. Rivera, Terry Collins again leaned on his mantra of sorts, one that he has repeatedly referenced in recent weeks \u2014 the same one that helped ignite last year\u2019s turnaround: If you hit, you play. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go with the guys who are producing runs,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThis is how we\u2019re going to win.\u2019\u2019 Hours later, then, after the Mets were shut out 1-0 by Tanner Roark and the Nationals, Collins found himself backed into something of a corner, in making it clear that he is going to stick with Jay Bruce for better or for worse. You\u2019d think it can\u2019t get much worse, of course, but the Mets have been thinking that for weeks now. It\u2019s not exactly breaking news that Bruce has been a bust since coming over in the Aug. 1 trade, but by now the Mets were sure he would have shaken off the trying-too-hard pressure and found the stroke that was leading the league in RBIs for the Reds. Instead he continues to struggle, hitting .192 in 36 games as a Met. And while he showed at least some signs of getting hot early this month with two home runs in three games, Bruce has slipped into a 2-for-17 slump, with those two home runs his only extra-base hits of the month."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "If you hit, you play? Not so much in this case. And the issue came to the forefront on Wednesday when Bruce struck out looking against Roark with the bases loaded and one out in the first inning, in what turned out to be the Mets\u2019 only real threat of the day. Even a sacrifice fly might have changed the complexion of the game, as well as Robert Gsellman pitched, holding the Nationals scoreless over 5.2 innings, lowering his ERA to 3.08 as he continues to impress. To be fair, Bruce did have a line single in the sixth, one of only three Met hits on the day. But a .192 batting average in 36 games is not exactly a small-sample size, at least not in the context of being in a tight wild-card race with only a couple of weeks remaining. Fortunately for the Mets, the Giants and Cardinals continue to spin their wheels, with both of them losing on Wednesday, and those two teams play each other over the next four days as the schedule now turns dramatically in favor of Collins\u2019 ballclub. That gives the manager a little more leeway in waiting for Bruce to get hot. Collins has sat him occasionally, hoping a mental break might help, but it sounds as if Bruce has convinced him the best way for him to break out is to play every day."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "\u201cHe\u2019s gotta battle through it,\u2019\u2019 Collins said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to him at length about it, and one of the things he\u2019s done throughout his career is play through things. He\u2019s been an everyday guy, he\u2019s never been a guy who has sat very much. \u201cHe\u2019s probably missed more time here than anywhere, so (earlier this week) I said, \u2018look, we\u2019re going to run you in there this week and see if we can get you started.\u2019\u2019\u2019 When asked about balancing Bruce\u2019s track record with the need to win now, as well as his you-hit-you-play philosophy, Collins seemed at least somewhat torn. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make excuses. But the one thing: who do we have that\u2019s going good that we can stick in there? When you take him out, you better have somebody you\u2019re confident can get the job done.\u2019\u2019 Well, Alejandro De Aza has had some big hits in recent weeks, certainly more than Bruce, and playing him in center while moving Curtis Granderson to right certainly improves the Mets\u2019 defense. And while Michael Conforto is only hitting .154 (2-for-13) since returning from the minors Sept. 1, he also hasn\u2019t started a game since Sept. 5. So there are viable options, to be sure, but let\u2019s not ignore the obvious either: Collins gets plenty of help in these matters from the front office, especially in this case since GM Sandy Alderson gave up a top prospect in Dilson Herrera to get Bruce."]
["sports/baseball/mets", "As for Bruce, he was accommodating Wednesday to media scrutiny after the game, making the case that he\u2019s been through this before and certain he\u2019ll come out of it, but he\u2019s running out of games to get on a hot streak. And so far there is no evidence one is coming. I can understand why Collins is still willing to wait on him, knowing how much impact he could have, but at some point soon the manager needs to be true to that mantra of his: In this case, if you don\u2019t hit, you don\u2019t play."]

["sports/hockey", "Gonchar, NHL players hit with Jowdy lawsuit  - NY Daily News Sergei Gonchar, in New York on Friday for a preseason game against the Rangers at the Garden, will return to Ottawa with an expensive souvenir. The Senators star was served with a $5 million malicious prosecution lawsuit that was filed by Ken Jowdy, the golf course developer accused in a 2009 suit of blowing $25 million of NHL players' money on porn stars, strippers and wild parties. Jowdy, the Cabo San Lucas developer and close friend of former Yankee pitcher Roger Clemens, claims in the lawsuit that he was the victim of a vicious legal and media smear campaign concocted by his former partner, Philip Kenner, an unlicensed financial advisor who calls himself a \"lifestyle coach\" to NHL players. Seven hockey players\u00a0- Gonchar, former Ranger and Islander Brian Berard, former Ranger Mattias Norstrom, Jere Lehtinen of the Dallas Stars and journeymen Glen Murray, Jozef Stumpel and Jason Woolley\u00a0- are also named in the lawsuit, which was filed in a California court in April. Convicted drug dealer Tommy Constantine and Ronald Richards, a Beverly Hills attorney who represented Kenner and Constantine in the 2009 litigation against Jowdy, are also named as defendants. Jowdy's attorney Robyn Crowther told the News that Gonchar was served in New York on Friday. Berard and Kenner have evaded service, but the other defendants have been served."]
["sports/hockey", "Richards said he has filed a motion to dismiss the suit as a violation California's anti-SLAPP statute. (SLAPP stands for \"strategic lawsuit against public participation,\" and California's anti-SLAPP statutes protect citizens from frivolous lawsuits or suits that lack merit.) He said a hearing on the motion has been scheduled for later this month. The lawsuit said the hockey players and the other defendants \"implemented a coordinated scheme to knowingly disseminate false information\" about Jowdy in a June 2009 lawsuit filed by Richards in the hope of taking over Jowdy's controlling interest in lucrative real estate development projects, including Diamante Cabo San Lucas, the Mexican golf course property valued at $450 million. Kenner's 2009 suit alleged that Jowdy blew the hockey players' investment in his golf course development by arranging for porn stars and strippers to attend functions in Mexico attended by Clemens, Joe Morgan and other baseball stars. Kenner also falsely claimed that an arrest warrant had been issued for Jowdy in Mexico based on false allegations, that labor disputes there had led to liens of $2.5 million against the properties, and that he had falsified financial statements. Jowdy said the allegations reported to the Mexican authorities are preposterous and absolutely false but that he lived in fear of arrest - or worse - because of them. The lawsuit Richards filed on behalf of the players was amended three times before it was withdrawn on Feb. 19, after four of the current and retired players violated a court order by failing to appear for depositions."]
["sports/hockey", "The players cited participation in the Winter Games for missing the court dates, even though only one whose deposition was scheduled played in the Olympics, and even though the deposition dates were selected by Richards, according to the lawsuit. Jowdy said he has not even met most of the players who sued him, and would welcome a chance to meet them. They invested in Diamante through Kenner, and Jowdy said he never dealt directly with them. The suit is the latest chapter in a bitter feud pitting Jowdy against Kenner and Constantine, a former race car driver who was sentenced to six years in prison in Illinois on drug charges in the 1990s. Kenner and Constantine themselves have been sued by Kenner's clients. Former NHL star Joe Juneau accused Kenner in a suit filed in December of 2008 in U.S. District Court in L.A. of bilking him out of millions in investments. An arbitrator awarded Minnesota Wild right wing Owen Nolan $2.5 million after Nolan claimed he was scammed by Kenner. Ethan Moreau of the Edmonton Oilers filed a suit at the same time against Constantine."]

["amp/sports/i-team", "Lance's legal fate rests in AG Holder's hands - NY Daily News Lance Armstrong's legal fate is now apparently in the hands of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\n\tThe Daily News has learned that Department of Justice officials who were leaning heavily toward joining the whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2010 by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis have now pulled back from their decision, leaving it up to Holder to make the call. RELATED: WADA WON'T PARTICIPATE IN UCI'S ARMSTRONG, DOPING PROBE\n\n\tIf the government does decide to join the suit, Armstrong\u2019s chances of a criminal conviction are believed to become much greater.\n\n\tThe DOJ officials responsible for making the decision on whether to join the suit turned to Holder after being contacted by Armstrong lawyer Robert Luskin in December about a possible settlement based on the $30 million the government agency paid to sponsor Armstrong\u2019s U.S. Postal Service teams from 1998-2004. He won the Tour de France from 1999-2005. RELATED: OPRAH 'SATISFIED' WITH WHAT LANCE CONFESSED Armstrong offered to pay the feds more than $5 million to compensate the U.S. Postal Service, CBS News reported late Tuesday. The team\u2019s agreement with the Postal Service specifically banned doping and required the officials to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d against individuals who used substances banned by cycling\u2019s governing bodies. The cyclist also offered to be a cooperating witness in the federal investigation. Justice Department officials rejected the offer, saying it was inadequate."]
["amp/sports/i-team", "Armstrong may still be in negotiations to return some of the money that fueled what the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency called the most sophisticated doping program in the history of sport in its 1,000-page report detailing Armstrong\u2019s extensive drug use as he raced to seven Tour victories."]
["amp/sports/i-team", "The Postal Service had decided last month to join the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the decision, but will now wait for Holder to decide whether to bring in the DOJ and the government\u2019s resources.\n\n\tLuskin did not return a call left for him in his Washington office; the DOJ declined comment.\n\n\tLandis filed the whistleblower suit, also known as a \u201cqui tam\u201d suit, against the U.S. Postal Service Team under the False Claims Act, which allows \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to file suit on behalf of the federal government, in 2010. Landis claims the team defrauded the Postal Service by taking sponsorship money \u2014 up to $30 million \u2014 from the government-funded agency while cyclists were doping. The government could seek as much as $90 million, which would be triple the damages.\n\n\tThe lawsuit remains under seal, but the Daily News reported in 2010 that the defendants in the suit include Armstrong, investment banker Thomas Weisel, who bankrolled several of Armstrong\u2019s teams, corporate backers Bart Knaggs, Bill Stapleton, who is Armstrong\u2019s longtime manager, as well as Johan Bruyneel, the sport director who oversaw Armstrong\u2019s teams.\n\n\tOther defendants are Tailwind Sports Corporation, Tailwind LLC, Montgomery Sports, Inc., and Capital Sports and Entertainment \u2014 all corporate entities that backed Armstrong\u2019s teams over the past decade. The DOJ has until Thursday, the day the first part of Armstrong\u2019s much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey airs, to join the suit, but sources told The News the decision could come as soon as Tuesday night. According to Winfrey, Armstrong admitted to doping.\n\n\tIt is Weisel, the San Francisco investment banker, who is believed to be most at risk if the government joins the suit because of his deep financial ties to Armstrong.\n\n\tAccording to documents unsealed in December, government investigators helping the DOJ decide whether to join the lawsuit subpoenaed Weisel, who is the founder of the Montgomery Securities investment bank, co-chairman of Stifel Financial and the man who took Yahoo! public. He is also the founder of Tailwind Sports, the holding company for U.S. Postal Service teams Armstrong led to so many victories.\n\n\tThe team said in its contracts that it would not tolerate doping; it is that clause that exposes Armstrong and possibly others, including Weisel, to criminal prosecution or civil litigation.\n\n\tArmstrong is already being challenged by SCA Promotions, a Dallas-based insurance company, which wants to recover $12 million it paid Tailwind in performance bonuses it says are negated by proof that Armstrong doped. SCA is expected to announce a lawsuit soon.\n\n\tBut it is the whistleblower suit that most concerns Armstrong and his associates. If Weisel is involved in a conspiracy to misuse government funds, according to Mike Morse, the chair of the national qui tam practice group at Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick & Raspanti, LLP in Philadelphia, he could be dragged into the litigation.\n\n\tKathy LeMond, the wife of American cyclist Greg LeMond, testified under oath during a 2006 deposition in the SCA case that Nike and Weisel paid $500,000 to former UCI president Hein Verbruggen to cover up a positive drug test.

Lance Armstrong's legal fate is now apparently in the hands of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\n\tThe Daily News has learned that Department of Justice officials who were leaning heavily toward joining the whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2010 by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis have now pulled back from their decision, leaving it up to Holder to make the call. RELATED: WADA WON'T PARTICIPATE IN UCI'S ARMSTRONG, DOPING PROBE\n\n\tIf the government does decide to join the suit, Armstrong\u2019s chances of a criminal conviction are believed to become much greater.\n\n\tThe DOJ officials responsible for making the decision on whether to join the suit turned to Holder after being contacted by Armstrong lawyer Robert Luskin in December about a possible settlement based on the $30 million the government agency paid to sponsor Armstrong\u2019s U.S. Postal Service teams from 1998-2004. He won the Tour de France from 1999-2005. RELATED: OPRAH 'SATISFIED' WITH WHAT LANCE CONFESSED Armstrong offered to pay the feds more than $5 million to compensate the U.S. Postal Service, CBS News reported late Tuesday. The team\u2019s agreement with the Postal Service specifically banned doping and required the officials to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d against individuals who used substances banned by cycling\u2019s governing bodies. The cyclist also offered to be a cooperating witness in the federal investigation. Justice Department officials rejected the offer, saying it was inadequate."]
["amp/sports/i-team", "Armstrong may still be in negotiations to return some of the money that fueled what the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency called the most sophisticated doping program in the history of sport in its 1,000-page report detailing Armstrong\u2019s extensive drug use as he raced to seven Tour victories."]
["amp/sports/i-team", "The Postal Service had decided last month to join the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the decision, but will now wait for Holder to decide whether to bring in the DOJ and the government\u2019s resources.\n\n\tLuskin did not return a call left for him in his Washington office; the DOJ declined comment.\n\n\tLandis filed the whistleblower suit, also known as a \u201cqui tam\u201d suit, against the U.S. Postal Service Team under the False Claims Act, which allows \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to file suit on behalf of the federal government, in 2010. Landis claims the team defrauded the Postal Service by taking sponsorship money \u2014 up to $30 million \u2014 from the government-funded agency while cyclists were doping. The government could seek as much as $90 million, which would be triple the damages.\n\n\tThe lawsuit remains under seal, but the Daily News reported in 2010 that the defendants in the suit include Armstrong, investment banker Thomas Weisel, who bankrolled several of Armstrong\u2019s teams, corporate backers Bart Knaggs, Bill Stapleton, who is Armstrong\u2019s longtime manager, as well as Johan Bruyneel, the sport director who oversaw Armstrong\u2019s teams.\n\n\tOther defendants are Tailwind Sports Corporation, Tailwind LLC, Montgomery Sports, Inc., and Capital Sports and Entertainment \u2014 all corporate entities that backed Armstrong\u2019s teams over the past decade. The DOJ has until Thursday, the day the first part of Armstrong\u2019s much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey airs, to join the suit, but sources told The News the decision could come as soon as Tuesday night. According to Winfrey, Armstrong admitted to doping.\n\n\tIt is Weisel, the San Francisco investment banker, who is believed to be most at risk if the government joins the suit because of his deep financial ties to Armstrong.\n\n\tAccording to documents unsealed in December, government investigators helping the DOJ decide whether to join the lawsuit subpoenaed Weisel, who is the founder of the Montgomery Securities investment bank, co-chairman of Stifel Financial and the man who took Yahoo! public. He is also the founder of Tailwind Sports, the holding company for U.S. Postal Service teams Armstrong led to so many victories.\n\n\tThe team said in its contracts that it would not tolerate doping; it is that clause that exposes Armstrong and possibly others, including Weisel, to criminal prosecution or civil litigation.\n\n\tArmstrong is already being challenged by SCA Promotions, a Dallas-based insurance company, which wants to recover $12 million it paid Tailwind in performance bonuses it says are negated by proof that Armstrong doped. SCA is expected to announce a lawsuit soon.\n\n\tBut it is the whistleblower suit that most concerns Armstrong and his associates. If Weisel is involved in a conspiracy to misuse government funds, according to Mike Morse, the chair of the national qui tam practice group at Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick & Raspanti, LLP in Philadelphia, he could be dragged into the litigation.\n\n\tKathy LeMond, the wife of American cyclist Greg LeMond, testified under oath during a 2006 deposition in the SCA case that Nike and Weisel paid $500,000 to former UCI president Hein Verbruggen to cover up a positive drug test. Nike has denied the charge.\n\n\tWhistleblower suits, says Morse, are \u201cthe government\u2019s most successful tool in recovering fraud against taxpayers, because now we\u2019re seeing billion-dollar settlements.\u201d Morse said the DOJ saw a record 647 qui tam lawsuits filed last year and recovered a record $3.3 billion in suits filed by whistleblowers during 2012.\n\n\tHe said Armstrong theoretically faces \u201chis own liability under the Federal False Claims Act, for conspiring with someone else to submit false claims to the government.\u201d\n\n\t\u201cIf there were false representations in order to get that money from the federal government to support the U.S. Postal teams, it could potentially expose those who submitted and those who helped in the submission of false claims to the government,\u201d said Morse\n\n\t\u201cIn the criminal context, they would be looking at what statements did Lance make and what intent did he make those statements with.\u201d"]

John Richardson, head of naval operations, ordered a pause in the 7th Fleet's operation to review immediate safety procedures. He also ordered a one-day \"operational pause,\" or stand down, across the Navy. The Pacific-based fleet will conduct that pause by Aug. 28, Swift said Tuesday. Richardson has also ordered a broader safety review for the 7th Fleet to examine issues such as personnel, equipment and navigation. Swift defended the sailors of the fleet, as well as the McCain crew who almost immediately had the destroyer operational after the collision as water poured flooded it. \"Make no mistake our sailors on these ships are doing critical work at sea,\" Swift said. \"And for more than 70 years, the U.S. Navy has helped guarantee the security and stability of the western Pacific.\" With News Wire Services With ELIZABETH ELIZALDE"]
["news/world", "2 Sydney hostages and gunman dead as chocolate shop siege ends after 16 hours It's over. After 16 hours, the standoff between a gunman who had held as many as 17 hostages in a Sydney chocolate shop and the cops has ended, leaving three people dead. Heavily armed cops stormed the Lindt Chocolat Cafe early Tuesday after a handful of hostages were seen running away.\u00a0The gunman, identified as\u00a0Man Haron Monis, was shot dead by cops. Two hostages killed have since been identified by local media as 38-year-old barrister and mother of three, Katrina Dawson, and 34-year-old Lindt Cafe manager, Tori Johnson. Johnson, who attended Washington State University for Hospitality Business Management in 2002, died a hero after attempting to knock the gun out of Monis' hand, the Australian reported. Four additional hostages have been hospitalized, including a woman who was shot in the leg. Six hostages were uninjured. In addition, a police officer suffered a gunshot wound to the face and has been hospitalized. Sydney police declined to say whether the two hostages killed were caught in crossfire or shot by the gunman. After a series of loud bangs, cops moved into the cafe not long after five or six hostages were seen running for their lives. \"They made the call because they believed that at that time, if they didn't enter, there would have been many more lives lost,\" New South Wales state police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said. As police moved in, armed with guns and stun grenades, more loud bangs, shouts and flashes followed."]
["news/world", "One crying woman was helped by officers and at least two others were wheeled out on stretchers. A gurney at the scene appeared to be carrying a man lying under a blood-soaked sheet with a bloody handprint in the middle. A woman with blood-covered feet was on the second gurney. The madman behind the attack had \"a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,\" said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. He described the attack as \"politically motivated\" by a gunman who \"sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] death cult.\" \"It's been a difficult day, which has tested us, but like Australians in all sorts of situations, we have risen to the challenge,\" he added in a statement. Police were acting cautiously after a report surfaced that Monis planted four bombs both inside the cafe and around the nearby financial district. Cops were called about 9:45 a.m. Monday to the cafe in the city's financial center, where the man, an Iranian refugee, pulled a gun from his blue sports bag and interrupted the bustling morning commute by taking hostages and hanging a black flag with white Arabic writing in the window. The flag appears to say, \"There is no God but Allah; Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah,\" a statement of Islamic faith that appears on the Saudi Arabian flag and the flag of extremist group ISIS."]
["news/world", "During the ordeal, several of the hostages were filmed, with a man behind them holding the same black flag, urging officials to heed Monis' demands. \"He's only asking for a flag and a phone call, and that's it,\" one woman says in one short, 40-second clip filmed inside the Lindt Chocolat Cafe. Those clips were posted to YouTube but quickly taken down after the video site deemed the films in violation of its terms of service. The videos quickly popped up elsewhere, including on LiveLeak, but Australian officials urged members of the media not to broadcast the clips. Bearded gunman Monis, 50, had been pictured wearing a bandanna around his head and communicating with authorities. He had demanded to meet with the prime minister and for an Islamic State flag be delivered to him, Sky News reported. \"We're working to establish who this person is and what their motive is,\" Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said in an afternoon briefing. Monis, who was born Manteghi Bourjerdi, has had multiple run-ins with the law. He was convicted of sexual assault, charged in connection with the stabbing death of his ex-wife and known for sending hate letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed overseas. He fled Iran for Australia in 1996. Last year his former wife was stabbed 18 times and set on fire. Monis' girlfriend is accused of the slaying and Monis was accused of being an accessory."]
["news/world", "Monis is also an outspoken critic of the NATO presence in Afghanistan who was sentenced last year to 300 hours of community service for sending what a judge called \"grossly offensive\" letters to families of\u00a0 soldiers killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009. At the time, Monis said his letters were \"flowers of advice,\" adding: \"Always, I stand behind my beliefs.\" \"This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act. It's a damaged goods individual who's done something outrageous,\" Manny Conditsis, his former lawyer, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. The scene grew chaotic six hours into the standoff when three male hostages, including one employee, got out of the cafe at 3:38 p.m. An employee wearing an apron left through a rear door toward a waiting pack of heavily armed tactical officers while two more dashed from the main entrance with their hands up. One of the men is being treated for shock at a local hospital,\u00a0News 9 reported. Two women in aprons who appeared to be employees made a hurried escape just before 5 p.m. In an emotional scene, one of the women ran into the arms of a gun-toting officer. \"We're just pleased to see them out,\" Scipione said. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird and the commissioner spoke with area Islamic leaders \"We are in this together,\" Baird assured at an evening press conference. Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli also expressed their shock and sadness over the tragedy in a statement that offered their support to the victims, their families, and their employees affected by this event."]
["news/world", "\"We are devastated by the loss of their lives and that several others were wounded and had to experience such trauma. Our thoughts and feelings are with the victims and their families who have been through an incredible ordeal, and we want to pay tribute to their courage and bravery,\" they stated in part. \"In these difficult times we all need to stand together in order to defend the values of freedom, peace and tolerance,\" added Ernst Tanner, Chairman and Group CEO Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli. Martin Place is still under lockdown and authorities said workers in the area should stay home Tuesday. Hostages took turns standing in front of the windows until dinnertime, when food was brought out of the cafe kitchen and everyone huddled to one side of the room,\u00a07News Sydney reported. The cafe's automatic doors were disabled, according to one witness. Hundreds of New South Wales cops and Australian federal police had responded to the hostage situation. \"I can think of almost nothing more distressing, more terrifying than to be caught up in such a situation,\" Abbott said. The prime minister urged Australians to go about their \"business as usual,\" despite the \"very disturbing incident.\" The gunman had hostages call several newsrooms Monday in an attempt to air his demands, but the media outlets did not did so at the request of authorities. The U.S. Consulate, about a 10-minute walk from the cafe, was evacuated, a spokeswoman told Reuters."]
["news/world", "Consulate officials issued an emergency warning to U.S. citizens in Australia to \"maintain a high level of vigilance and take the appropriate steps to enhance your personal security.\" Other nearby buildings were evacuated and the block was cordoned off. A wide swath of Sydney was declared a no-fly zone for aircraft to avoid the crush of police helicopters. The landmark Sydney Opera House, which is near the cafe, was briefly closed before reopening in the afternoon. The siege at the cafe came just hours after Australian federal authorities arrested a man in northwestern Sydney for allegedly financing terrorism. Federal cops said in a statement that the man was arrested \"as part of continuing investigations into the planning of a terrorist attack on Australian soil and the facilitation of travel of Australian citizens to Syria to engage in armed combat.\" The 25-year-old man, whose name was not released, was arrested as he left a prayer hall, an Australian radio station reported. Another man allegedly connected to the same operation is believed to already be in custody. Three months ago, federal police exposed a plot to kidnap an Australian at random, behead him in a public area \u2014 such as the Martin Place pedestrian zone where the hostage scene is located \u2014 and post the execution to social media. Numerous people were arrested. Many Australians, using the Twitter hashtag #IllRideWithYou, offered to accompany people dressed in Muslim clothes who were afraid of a backlash. An NYPD spokesman said city police are \"monitoring the situation in Sydney.\""]

The comic book character's position as an honorary ambassador to the United Nations will end on Friday \u2014 just two months after her controversial appointment, according to the United Nations. Wonder Woman's new platform was meant to be part of an empowerment campaign for women and girls, but as soon as news broke that she would serve as an ambassador, her scantily clad looks caused a public outcry. A spokesperson for the UN told the Daily News that its fictional character campaigns typically only last a short time and Wonder Woman's campaign was initially slated to end around this time.  Wonder Woman's UN ambassador ceremony tied up by feminist protest  However, there was some confusion as DC Entertainment plans to use the character in future endeavors to carry out the UN's mission of achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls through 2017. \"We\u2019re happy we got great outreach to Wonder Woman fans,\" UN spokesperson Jeffrey Brez told The News. The superhero's appointment sparked enough controversy to lead people to create an online petition to have UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon reconsider the decision. About 45,000 people signed the pledge \u2014 including a handful of UN staffers. Nearly 100 demonstrators turned out during the October ceremony where Wonder Woman was named an ambassador in order to protest the decision.

Angela Bianco was shopping elsewhere in Roosevelt Field Mall on Oct. 27, 2014 when the grand larceny went down inside Helzberg Diamonds, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court. An unidentified man and a woman, clearly in their 20s, stole the ring valued at $2,499 when a clerk's back was turned, the suit states. The crooks left behind a stolen driver's license and credit card, neither of which had any link to Bianco.

In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, the estimated 600,000 people who live in New York City\u2019s public housing facilities should not be forced to struggle with leaky roofs, mold, unreliable heating, broken down elevators and vermin. As a nation, we must do better than that.

["amp/opinion", "Over 20,000 people live in 10 public housing developments in Brownsville. That represents the largest concentration of public housing in this country. Residents there must contend with inadequate services, a lack of primary health care and a Republican Congress that continues to balance the budget on the backs of senior citizens, children, the disabled, the sick and the most vulnerable in this country. Crime is all too common under conditions like these, and Brownsville is no exception. According to a 2013 report, one out of every 50 men in New York\u2019s prisons comes from Brownsville. It has been estimated that the state of New York has spent about $40 million a year locking up black and Hispanic men from Brownsville alone. We must invest in neighborhoods like Brownsville, and that investment must include decent and affordable housing. That is why I have developed an affordable housing plan \u2014 one that will also create millions of good-paying jobs. BERNIE PREACHES INCOME INEQAULITY AT THE VATICAN This plan will expand the National Housing Trust Fund, which was initiated by legislation I authored in 2001, to construct, preserve and rehabilitate at least 3.5 million affordable apartments and homes over the next decade. It will provide federal funding to reduce the $17 billion in unmet capital needs at the New York City Housing Authority and it will substantially reduce the unacceptable backlog of capital needs in all of our nation\u2019s public housing facilities."]
["amp/opinion", "It will provide enough housing vouchers to help the more than 3 million lower-income Americans who are struggling to stay in safe and secure housing today. And it will make it easier to refinance mortgages, especially in communities of color that were targeted by predatory lenders. These measures are urgently needed. From 2000 through 2012, the cost of rental housing in New York City increased by 75%, while real median income went down by 5%. Meanwhile, the number of rent-controlled affordable apartments available to low-income New Yorkers has gone down by some 385,000 over the past 14 years. Today, Brooklyn is the most unaffordable housing market in America. The median price of a home in Brooklyn is $615,000, but the median household income is just $833 a week. The typical Brooklyn family would have to spend 98% of its income just to be able to own a modest house there. No one can do that. In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression. Last year, more than 100,000 people in New York slept in homeless shelters \u2014 including more than 40,000 children. This is simply unacceptable. We must solve the affordable housing crisis, in New York and across our country. We must address the crisis of homelessness. And we must increase the incomes of the working poor by raising the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $15 an hour."]

Sanders, who represents Vermont in the U.S. Senate, is running for the Democratic nomination for President. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders holds a rally outside his childhood home in Flatbush on April 8, 2016 in Brooklyn Bernie Sanders in Brownsville On Sunday, I went to Brooklyn\u2019s Brownsville neighborhood with Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and New York City Council Members Jumaane Williams and Ritchie Torres. I came away from this visit more determined than ever to address the affordable housing crisis and to build an economy that works for all of us, not just those on top. In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, the estimated 600,000 people who live in New York City\u2019s public housing facilities should not be forced to struggle with leaky roofs, mold, unreliable heating, broken down elevators and vermin. As a nation, we must do better than that."]
["amp/opinion", "TRANSCRIPT: BERNIE SANDERS MEETS WITH THE DAILY NEWS EDITORIAL BOARD There is something profoundly wrong when we have a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires while we have the highest childhood poverty rate of almost every major country on earth. When it comes to the crisis of poverty and inequality, communities like Brownsville are ground zero. More than a third of Brownsville\u2019s young men are unemployed. About 46% of Brownsville\u2019s residents rely on food stamps to feed themselves and their families. The poverty rate in Brownsville is over 35%. SANDERS ARGUES AGAINST CLINTON AT AL SHARPTON'S CONFERENCE And that poverty kills. People who live in Brownsville die 11 years earlier than people who live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Over 20,000 people live in 10 public housing developments in Brownsville. That represents the largest concentration of public housing in this country. Residents there must contend with inadequate services, a lack of primary health care and a Republican Congress that continues to balance the budget on the backs of senior citizens, children, the disabled, the sick and the most vulnerable in this country. Crime is all too common under conditions like these, and Brownsville is no exception. According to a 2013 report, one out of every 50 men in New York\u2019s prisons comes from Brownsville. It has been estimated that the state of New York has spent about $40 million a year locking up black and Hispanic men from Brownsville alone."]
["amp/opinion", "We must invest in neighborhoods like Brownsville, and that investment must include decent and affordable housing. That is why I have developed an affordable housing plan \u2014 one that will also create millions of good-paying jobs. BERNIE PREACHES INCOME INEQAULITY AT THE VATICAN This plan will expand the National Housing Trust Fund, which was initiated by legislation I authored in 2001, to construct, preserve and rehabilitate at least 3.5 million affordable apartments and homes over the next decade. It will provide federal funding to reduce the $17 billion in unmet capital needs at the New York City Housing Authority and it will substantially reduce the unacceptable backlog of capital needs in all of our nation\u2019s public housing facilities. It will provide enough housing vouchers to help the more than 3 million lower-income Americans who are struggling to stay in safe and secure housing today. And it will make it easier to refinance mortgages, especially in communities of color that were targeted by predatory lenders. These measures are urgently needed. From 2000 through 2012, the cost of rental housing in New York City increased by 75%, while real median income went down by 5%. Meanwhile, the number of rent-controlled affordable apartments available to low-income New Yorkers has gone down by some 385,000 over the past 14 years. Today, Brooklyn is the most unaffordable housing market in America. The median price of a home in Brooklyn is $615,000, but the median household income is just $833 a week. The typical Brooklyn family would have to spend 98% of its income just to be able to own a modest house there. No one can do that."]
["amp/opinion", "In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression. Last year, more than 100,000 people in New York slept in homeless shelters \u2014 including more than 40,000 children. This is simply unacceptable. We must solve the affordable housing crisis, in New York and across our country. We must address the crisis of homelessness. And we must increase the incomes of the working poor by raising the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $15 an hour. We also need to make it easier for people in New York and elsewhere to buy their first home. We can do that by expanding down-payment assistance programs; offering pre-purchase housing counseling; reforming the way credit scores are calculated, and preventing predatory lending. I have fought for affordable housing since I was first elected mayor of Burlington, Vt. in 1981. Today we are facing a crisis. It is our duty to make housing affordable in New York and across this nation. If we can bail out Wall Street, we can make sure that everyone in this country has a safe, secure and affordable place to live.

By the time Petty\u2019s performance in the Jets preseason opener was over, I nearly felt his pain. It\u2019s a wonder the poor guy made it out of bed Friday morning after taking body blows from every conceivable direction. Heck, his teammate even crunched him once after failing to pick up a heat-seeking missile disguised as a blitzing cornerback.

["sports/football/jets", "It\u2019s premature to throw Wrangler jeans and a gold jacket on Petty, but the second-year signal caller showed enough promise against the Jaguars to warrant more playing time with a better supporting cast in the second preseason game in Washington on Friday. Todd Bowles maintained over the weekend that there\u2019s no competition between Geno Smith and Petty for the No. 2 quarterback job, which runs contrary to the coach\u2019s philosophy: Anybody can slide down the depth chart if the man below him seizes the opportunity and takes it away. Bowles made that abundantly clear on the second day of camp when asked about whether the backup gig was up for grabs. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs if the other guys play well,\u201d Bowles said less than three weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s just like any other position.

["sports/football/jets", "The mercurial former starter has waged the weirdest of boycotts against the media in recent days. Word on the street is that Smith was less than thrilled with a headline for a story chronicling the one-year anniversary of his locker room altercation with IK Enemkpali that ultimately cost him his starting job. (One of Geno\u2019s handlers should inform him that reporters don\u2019t write the headlines, but I digress.) Smith took his displeasure to social media Sunday with a pair of tweets intimating that the media fabricates stories (INSERT EYE ROLL HERE), thereby needlessly creating a story at a time when he should be concerned about more important matters. A few minutes later, he tweeted that he was focused. By the way, focused people in any walk of life don\u2019t waste time or energy tweeting that they\u2019re focused to a bunch of strangers.  So, what's up with Geno Smith's subtweets? Jets backup QB upset  While Geno is doing Geno things, Petty deserves a chance to have at least one series with the first-team offense after Fitzpatrick gets his work in against Washington to better evaluate him as the brain trust considers keeping four quarterbacks. (Fitzpatrick played six series and into the middle of the second quarter in the second preseason game last year.) The Jets should minimize Petty\u2019s time behind the third-string line if they want to truly gauge his progress \u2026 and value his health. Consider Petty\u2019s supporting cast in the preseason opener: He was throwing to two undrafted rookie receivers (Jalin Marshall and Robby Anderson), a seventh-round rookie (Charone Peake) and a second-year guy from Troy (Chandler Worthy). Petty\u2019s running back: An undrafted rookie (Romar Morris)."]

In a feat that would surely baffle chemists everywhere, the offensive line turned from a solid to a liquid. Petty was unofficially pressured on eight of 17 drop backs.

WPIX\u2019s Allison Kaden reported on the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony Wednesday night and explained that cops kept out a group of protesters furious that a Staten Island grand jury\u00a0failed to indict the New York Police Department cop.

["sports/more-sports", "Wheels turning on Lance following Landis' claims - NY Daily News The e-mails were just the warmup ride for Floyd Landis. A week after Landis' long-delayed doping confession came to light - along with his extraordinary accusations against Lance Armstrong and other top cyclists - the man who saw his 2006 Tour de France title stripped for a positive drug test is continuing to spill the beans in conversations with anti-doping officials and law enforcement agents. \"They're in regular communication,\" said a source close to the situation who insisted on anonymity. \"Daily, several times a day. The feds are waiting to see who comes forward.\" The Daily News was the first to report that Jeff Novitzky, one of the federal government's star criminal investigators, was involved in the Landis case, which exploded after Landis sent an April 30 e-mail to a cycling official outlining sophisticated doping programs on the U.S. Postal Service team led by Armstrong. Since then, Novitzky has opened a file on the seven-time Tour de France champion, and while it is unclear what the scope of Novitzky's probe will be, he has spoken with several cycling figures in Southern California. Whatever credibility Landis brings to the case is ultimately unimportant if federal agents begin collecting sworn witness statements and other evidence that corroborates the claims he made. As in the past, Novitzky is working in cooperation with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. His investigation still appears to be in its early stages."]
["sports/more-sports", "Armstrong, who is in Europe, has denied Landis' accusations. Wednesday, after the governing body of cycling announced it had asked for four different investigations based on Landis' charges, Armstrong's team acknowledged the various probes with aggressive language that is typical of those who have fought to protect Armstrong's reputation through years of suspicion. \"We understand that responsible anti-doping organizations and governmental agencies have an obligation to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, even when those allegations are baseless, incredible and made by people with improper motives,\" said a statement from the team. \"If any governmental or anti-doping organizations conduct a proper investigation, Lance looks forward to once again being totally vindicated after a fair investigation.\" Novitzky, who brought down the BALCO doping ring as well as the steroid distribution network that Kirk Radomski set up in Major League Baseball, moved from the Internal Revenue Service to the Food and Drug Administration two years ago. One thing that appears clear is that Landis, who denied doping for four years before his recent confession, is continuing to cooperate with USADA, and has educated the group about major loopholes in drug testing regimens, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. Landis has noted weak points in drug testing regimens, including in the blood-profiling tests that constitute the vaunted \"biological passport\" system. The system involves creating a database of various blood scores; radical fluctuations can theoretically indicate cheating, even if traditional tests don't reveal substances. Landis is said to have described intravenous injections of banned endurance booster erythropoetin (or EPO) as a way to realign blood values, and therefore to mask the effects of blood transfusions."]
["sports/more-sports", "\"EPO is no longer the primary source of the gains, it's just something you use to make it look like everything is normal,\" said the person with knowledge of Landis' conversations. \"You get the transfusion, and that's what skews the values. You correct that by using small doses of EPO.\" Most anti-doping experts have traditionally seen EPO - which is detectable, but imperfectly so - as an end in and of itself. The usage Landis has told officials about is more of a means to an end, as if cyclists were using it as a masking agent for blood transfusions. In a series of e-mails to cycling and anti-doping officials last month, Landis described using EPO, steroids and transfusions as he rode in support of a victorious Armstrong on the U.S. Postal Service cycling team between 2002 and 2005. After the notes surfaced and a predictable backlash hit Landis, he got on the telephone with former cyclist Frankie Andreu, who now manages a cycling team. As the two talked, Andreu tells the Daily News, a feeling of sympathy settled over Andreu, who in 2006 confessed to using\u00a0EPO while riding with Armstrong's team. In Landis, Andreu sensed the isolation that he felt when he became a reluctant whistleblower and put himself at odds with Armstrong. \"I can relate to Floyd, getting shredded,\" Andreu said, recalling the backlash that he and his wife, Betsy, faced after they testified against Armstrong in an arbitration case. \"We just got ripped apart, the same way Floyd is.\""]
["sports/more-sports", "Andreu said he thinks Landis' allegations need to be investigated, at the very least so that cycling can find out how its anti-doping nets were so full of holes in those years. For Landis to even speak with USADA officials is a major bridge, given the legal attack Landis unleashed as he fought to prevent a competition ban and keep his 2006 Tour de France title. \"If anything, this is good for the riders that are clean because you can get away from the past problems,\" Andreu said. Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union (UCI), disagreed. He said Landis had done a disservice to his sport. \"It's just a pity that Floyd Landis had to bring this up and drag this sport into more disrepute,\" said McQuaid, whose organization oversees elite cycling. Wednesday he asked national cycling federations in Australia, Belgium, Canada and France to open probes similar to the one the USADA has launched against Armstrong and his cohorts. \"We're following the procedures within our rules,\" McQuaid said. \"The national federations are asked to conduct an inquiry. If they find wrongdoing, they take action within those rules, and ultimately they will refer it to the UCI.\" McQuaid said the federations had no deadline, but that he hoped they would conduct their inquiries expeditiously."]
["sports/i-team", "Scammers on Ice: Feds requesting no bail for accused hockey swindlers - NY Daily News In early 2011 a Long Island man received an angry voicemail from Phil Kenner, the Arizona man arrested Wednesday for allegedly stealing at least $15 million from a group of NHL players in a decade-long fraud. Amid vulgar oaths, Kenner made reference to the man\u2019s 8-year-old son. \u201cBring your son out to Arizona,\u201d Kenner said, according to court papers, \u201cso he can see what it looks like when his dad gets an ass beating.\u201d The recipient of the nasty voicemail was a relative of two victims of the scam Kenner is alleged to have perpetrated. At the time he sent it, Kenner \u2014 who called himself a \u201clifestyle coach\u201d \u2014 was desperate to prop up a massive, complex plot that a federal indictment says he orchestrated in cahoots with convicted cocaine dealer Tommy Constantine. A recording of the voicemail is now in possession of the feds, who are requesting that Kenner and Constantine be held without bail following their arrests. That may be just a small sample of the behavior Kenner and Constantine exhibited as a sometimes wild three-year criminal investigation zeroed in on them. \u201cThis recording demonstrates Kenner\u2019s capacity and propensity for threatening and intimidating witnesses,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a letter to a federal judge Wednesday, adding that Kenner and Constantine \u201cboth pose a substantial risk of flight.\u201d"]
["sports/i-team", "Two of those witnesses and alleged victims \u2014 former No. 1 NHL pick Bryan Berard and former NYPD and Long Island cop John Kaiser \u2014 have told the Daily News they were besieged with anonymous threats and harassment during the long investigation. Just a month or so before the voice mail was delivered, Kenner had sent an email to one of his investors declaring that another witness in the case had paid a Mexican official $100,000 that day to \"interfere with a federal arrest warrant.\" Kenner claimed in that March 15, 2011, email that he had been lurking nearby the witness's property for eight hours to see that the warrant be served. \"Our head fed guy went back to the state Capitol (la Paz) this afternoon to get a document that let's us take the target with deadly force as early as tonight,\" Kenner said in the email, which concluded: \"The story continues. I can't leave until he's arrested. I'll keep you posted.\" Kaiser says Kenner told Kaiser\u2019s brother that he would \u201ctake care of his brother,\u201d and that Kenner tracked Kaiser\u2019s travel to Mexico. \u201cHe always knew what plane I was on,\u201d Kaiser says. Berard lived in fear that he would be framed for a crime, and was alerted by a law enforcement friend in Rhode Island late this summer that someone had called in a false tip on him, perhaps, he thought, to disrupt his cooperation."]
["sports/i-team", "Developer Ken Jowdy, with whom Kenner waged a long legal battle over control of a new golf course in Cabo San Lucas called Diamante, told the Daily News in a series of interviews over the last four years that he had been threatened and victimized by Kenner, fearing for his life as he worked to turn Diamante into one of the most acclaimed new courses in the world. The two indicted men might also pose a threat to each other. Kenner sued Constantine \u2014 also known as Tommy Homovitis \u2014 in March, challenging Constantine\u2019s bankruptcy filing and claiming that Constantine owed him shares in a bank-card company called Eufora LLC and a now non-existent airline called SetJets. He also accused Constantine of frauds against the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Documents in that case include screengrabs of smartphone texts messages in which the two men frankly describe everything from a Vegas escort to a Falcon jet amid the fluctuations of their numerous bank accounts. But Kenner also includes a list of embarrassing text messages sent to him by Constantine that paints his former partner as penniless and pathetic. \u201cYeah I am so broke I couldn\u2019t get laid in a Russian whorehouse on Rubel night,\u201d Constantine wrote in one text. \u201cHonestly right now I just need to be able to eat and buy gas,\u201d he said in another, before going on to say in vulgar terms that he needed $5,000 within 24 hours and $75,000 in 72 hours or \u201cit\u2019s all over.\u201d"]
["sports/i-team", "Following their arrests on Wednesday near their homes in Scottsdale, detention hearings were scheduled for Kenner and Constantine next week in the federal courthouse in Phoenix, but according to a source familiar with the case, Constantine\u2019s lawyer, New York-based Ed Little, was expected to ask the judge for an expedited hearing for his client, possibly as early as Friday. The government was expected to counter with a claim that Constantine, who filed for bankruptcy protection on March 11, had violated laws by not disclosing that he had retained Little prior to the arrest, and should not be awarded an expedited hearing in the financial fraud case. It was unclear if Kenner had secured an attorney other than the public defender who represented him in court Wednesday. As the Daily News first reported Wednesday, the two men were arrested near Phoenix, but will face arraignment in the Eastern District of New York. And if the duo of one-time high-flying playboys can\u2019t get free on bail in the next few days, they will be transported from Phoenix to Long Island in federal custody. Meanwhile, the witnesses and alleged victims in the case continue to look nervously over their shoulders as the case begins its journey through the justice system. Kaiser, who had begun working with Jowdy in Cabo last year, describes a break-in at his apartment there in which three assailants came after him with a pipe, a knife and a bat. He isn\u2019t sure who sent them, but he managed to successfully fight them off \u2014 tossing one over a balcony in the dark before a security force arrived and the assailants fled."]

After hearing every imaginable joke about his balls, Tom Brady, as usual, had the last laugh. Aw, nuts! More than seven months after Brady and the Patriots were first accused by the Indianapolis Colts of deflating footballs beyond league parameters in their AFC playoff game in January, the New England quarterback had his four-game NFL suspension for what became known (ad nauseum) as \u201cDeflategate\u201d spiked by a federal judge on Sept. 3. The ruling by U.S. District Court judge Richard Berman came just in time for Brady to play from the start of the season in defense of the fourth career Super Bowl title he won over Seattle on Feb. 1. Patriots owner Robert Kraft had agreed to surrender two draft picks and pay a $1 million fine to settle the controversy, but Brady opted to fight the league when singled out for punishment by commissioner Roger Goodell. The months in-between featured a series of comical moments, including Brady\u2019s initial press conference on the topic, which was quickly mocked by Saturday Night Live. \"Everybody has a preference,\u201d Brady said in January. \u201cSome guys like them round.

["news/crime", "Survivors of NYC bombings baffled by Puerto Rican Day Parade's honoring of FALN militant Oscar Lopez Rivera They will never forget. The memories of the Puerto Rican separatist bombing campaign four decades ago remain fresh in the minds of first-responders and survivors \u2014 including an ex-fire marshal, a former bomb squad tech and the son of a man killed at Fraunces Tavern. On New Year's Eve in 1982, NYPD bomb squad tech Anthony Senft was sent to defuse a bomb packed with dynamite near the old Manhattan federal courthouse on Centre St. Moments earlier, Officer Rocco Pascarella, working security at police headquarters, lost part of his left leg when another bomb exploded. Senft's police dog, High Hat, detected four sticks of dynamite. Senft gave High Hat a snack, then tied the dog behind a wall. Senft and his partner Richard Pastorella, both in bomb suits, approached. \"He was kneeling and I bent over and, boom \u2014 that's all I remembered for a month,\" Senft, 70, recalled Thursday. He broke his hip, lost his right eye, had both eardrums replaced and still lives with chronic pain. Pastorella lost five fingers and was blinded. \"You sneeze, it hurts. You cough,\" Senft said. \"You can't even touch the bad eye. That's how painful it is.\" Investigators tied the explosion to the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional, or FALN \u2014 which planted more than 100 bombs in New York City and Chicago during the 1970s and '80s."]
["news/crime", "On Jan. 24, 1975, seven years before Senft and Pastorella nearly died, Fire Marshal John Knox arrived to an appalling scene of smoke and carnage at the historic Fraunces Tavern on Water St. A large FALN bomb had exploded there, killing four and wounding 43. \"It was lunchtime,\" Knox, 81, recalled Tuesday. \"The walls were blown out, debris on the street. People were burned, they were covered with soot, dirt. It was mayhem.\" Later that very day, 9-year-old Joseph Connor was playing with friends on his birthday when his mother called him inside. His father, Frank, 33, had been killed at Fraunces. \"It was as bad a situation as you can imagine,\" Joseph Connor, now 50, said. \"You go from celebrating your birthday to finding out your dad was murdered, all in an instant.\" The terror group later released a communique, which read, \"You have unleased a storm from which you comfortable Yankis (sic) cannot escape.\" Senft, Knox and Connor have turned their thoughts to those days because National Puerto Rican Day Parade organizers will honor Oscar Lopez Rivera, 74, a mastermind of the bombing campaign, on June 11 as a \"National Freedom Hero.\" Lopez Rivera served nearly 40 years in prison for sedition \u2014 plotting to overthrow the government \u2014 and other felonies for his role in the FALN. He was sentenced to 15 additional years for plotting a prison escape. President Barack Obama commuted his 55-year sentence in January, and he was released from house arrest in San Juan on May 17."]

Sponsors, including the Daily News, Corona, Univision, AT&T; and the Yankees, have pulled out. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and Mayor de Blasio say they will march. On Thursday, Mark-Viverito repeated her support for Lopez Rivera, saying he was \"not linked to any act of violence.\" A senior law enforcement source told The News on Thursday there is no doubt that Lopez Rivera was deeply involved. Dynamite found in a Chicago safe house linked to him was the same as the explosive used in an Aug. 3, 1977, blast in New York, the source said. In that explosion at the Mobil Employment Services office on 150 E. 42nd St., one man died and five others were injured. Dynamite, timers, blasting caps, disguises and ammo were found in a Chicago apartment linked to him, the source said. Cooperating witness Alfred Mendez said Lopez Rivera trained him to make bombs, the source said. Senft, who retired in 2008 and lives on Long Island, calls the lionization of Lopez Rivera the worst kind of politics. \"I'm absolutely appalled,\" he said. \"We're making a folk hero out of him. He's a terrorist.\" He said the ex-con is getting his freedom back while those killed or maimed get nothing. \"No one's giving me my eyesight back. But this is not about me. I'm talking for the other people who are blind, who lost their legs, who were killed. I was lucky. I survived.\""]

The FALN, the Weathermen and the Black Liberation Army were all active. \"The social dynamics of all of these things happening at the same time were incredible,\" Knox says. \"It seemed like every night there was a bombing or a serious fire, and it was almost always one of these groups involved.\" Knox also responded to the Queens apartment where FALN member William Morales was seriously injured when a pipe bomb he was building exploded on July 12, 1978. He blew off all of his fingers. \"He looked like a piece of rare roast beef,\" he said. \"Part of his face was gone. He was bleeding right through everything.\" Morales somehow survived and escaped from the hospital. He has lived in Cuba, away from extradition, for decades. Knox and Senft don't believe the majority of Puerto Ricans support Lopez Rivera's beliefs. \"I don't think he's a freedom fighter, and I don't think most Puerto Ricans do, either,\" Knox said. \"If you talk to them, more than half want to stay as a commonwealth.\" Connor followed his dad into finance and worked at his late father's company."]

Ramos and Detective Dan Mulligan were in Los Angeles to extradite defendants in an alleged $32 million gambling ring busted in Queens. They were grabbing some coffee at a Starbucks in the heart of the tourist hotspot when they heard the wailing of a panicked woman echo through the Hollywood and Highland shopping complex. \"I heard a woman screaming up on the promenade,\" Mulligan calmly told ABC7 after the terrifying takedown. The woman ran past the plainclothes cops with her two children, clearly in distress, he said. \"She ran back to what we saw was a fight in progress and she came back screaming again,\" Mulligan recalled. Ramos recalled the moment he learned a deadly weapon was involved in a nearby altercation. \"There's a knife. So I said, 'I got it.' I pulled out my weapon,\" Ramos said. \"Al went to the left, I went to the right. The victim came toward me. Al yelled a police command, 'Get on the ground! Drop the knife!'\" Mulligan recalled. \"Thank God he complied immediately, and it was over in a matter of seconds,\" Mulligan said."]

The cops estimated the stab wound was 4 to 5 inches long and an inch-and-a-half wide. \"It looked bad at first. I just hope it wasn't the jugular. And thank God, I believe it wasn't because he's still alive today,\" Mulligan said.

This person has a serious history of mental illness. The victim is lucky to be alive,\" an LAPD source told the Daily News on Wednesday night. \"Thank God someone was there at the scene to intervene, especially people with some training in a crisis,\" the source at the LAPD Hollywood Station said.

["amp/news/national", "Calif. gov signs two 'Brock Turner' bills - NY Daily News SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 California Gov. Jerry Brown said Friday that he signed two bills that emerged amid national outrage over the six-month jail sentence given to a former Stanford University swimmer who sexually assaulted a woman passed out near a trash bin. The Democratic governor approved requiring sentences to be served in state prison for defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims instead of the jail sentence like the one Brock Turner received in June and served in a county jail before obtaining early release. Turner's case burst into the spotlight after a poignant statement from the victim swept through social media. Politicians and law enforcement officials have lined up alongside sexual assault survivors to criticize Turner's sentence, back a recall effort against the judge and urge Brown to sign the tougher sentencing legislation. SEE IT: Brock Turner registers as a sex offender  The 21-year-old one-time Olympic hopeful was released from the Santa Clara County jail in September after serving three months for good behavior. He will be on probation for three years in his native Ohio for crimes that carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Brown said in a signing message that he usually opposes adding more mandatory minimum sentences. But he said he signed the sentencing bill \"because I believe it brings a measure of parity to sentencing for criminal acts that are substantially similar.\""]
["amp/news/national", "Outside jail after Turner's release, county Sheriff Laurie Smith said she believed his sentence was too light and urged Brown to sign the bill. \"Letting felons convicted of such crimes get off with probation discourages other survivors from coming forward and sends the message that raping incapacitated victims is no big deal,\" Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd of Napa said in a statement after lawmakers approved his bill in August. Fraternity at University of Richmond suspended over email But more than two dozen groups dedicated to ending campus sexual assaults urged Brown to veto it, fearing that the punishment would more likely be applied to minority and lower-income defendants than white offenders like Turner. Mahroh Jahangiri, executive director of Know Your IX, a national organization representing survivors, said mandatory minimum sentences also could deter victims from pressing charges against their attackers, who are often people they know. Brown also signed another bill permitting sexual assault victims to say in court that they were raped, even if the attack doesn't meet the technical definition under California law. State law defines rape as nonconsensual intercourse between a man and a woman, leaving out other forms of sexual assault, including Turner's 2015 attack on the woman he met at a fraternity party.

["amp/news/national", "In this Jan. 14, 2016 file photo, California Gov. Jerry Brown speaks at the Association of California Water Agencies conference, in Sacramento, Calif. An undated photo of Brock Allen Turner is shown in Ohio State General's office website. SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 California Gov. Jerry Brown said Friday that he signed two bills that emerged amid national outrage over the six-month jail sentence given to a former Stanford University swimmer who sexually assaulted a woman passed out near a trash bin. The Democratic governor approved requiring sentences to be served in state prison for defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims instead of the jail sentence like the one Brock Turner received in June and served in a county jail before obtaining early release. Turner's case burst into the spotlight after a poignant statement from the victim swept through social media. Politicians and law enforcement officials have lined up alongside sexual assault survivors to criticize Turner's sentence, back a recall effort against the judge and urge Brown to sign the tougher sentencing legislation. SEE IT: Brock Turner registers as a sex offender  The 21-year-old one-time Olympic hopeful was released from the Santa Clara County jail in September after serving three months for good behavior. He will be on probation for three years in his native Ohio for crimes that carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Brown said in a signing message that he usually opposes adding more mandatory minimum sentences. But he said he signed the sentencing bill \"because I believe it brings a measure of parity to sentencing for criminal acts that are substantially similar.\""]
["amp/news/national", "Outside jail after Turner's release, county Sheriff Laurie Smith said she believed his sentence was too light and urged Brown to sign the bill. \"Letting felons convicted of such crimes get off with probation discourages other survivors from coming forward and sends the message that raping incapacitated victims is no big deal,\" Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd of Napa said in a statement after lawmakers approved his bill in August. Fraternity at University of Richmond suspended over email But more than two dozen groups dedicated to ending campus sexual assaults urged Brown to veto it, fearing that the punishment would more likely be applied to minority and lower-income defendants than white offenders like Turner. Mahroh Jahangiri, executive director of Know Your IX, a national organization representing survivors, said mandatory minimum sentences also could deter victims from pressing charges against their attackers, who are often people they know. Brown also signed another bill permitting sexual assault victims to say in court that they were raped, even if the attack doesn't meet the technical definition under California law. State law defines rape as nonconsensual intercourse between a man and a woman, leaving out other forms of sexual assault, including Turner's 2015 attack on the woman he met at a fraternity party. He was convicted of three sexual assault felonies, including digital penetration of an unconscious woman. Brock Turner\u2019s parents ask cops to monitor neighborhood protests"]

["amp/sports/football/jets", "Petty wouldn\u2019t confirm if the play-calling was by design but acknowledged there were some \u201cgood things and some construction\u201d he saw from the film. \u201cI think that there definitely were some more opportunities there to go downfield that I\u2019ll learn as I go,\u201d Petty said. \u201cWhen to make those shots and when I can make those shots. It\u2019s not about being just a game manager. You want to win. I don\u2019t like flirting with that line. I want to win. I like slinging the ball around.

It just means a lot that we can go in and it\u2019s not awkward,\u201d Petty said. \u201cWho\u2019s ever in there, we\u2019re trying to make each other better. On the field competitively and then we\u2019re trying to help each other in film room too. I don\u2019t help him near as much as he helps me. It\u2019s been great.\u201d \u00a0"]

Officers responded to a 911 call reporting a domestic dispute at approximately 4:19 p.m. and went to Cunningham's home on Lafayette Avenue in Summit, N.J. Cunningham received a third-degree charge for invasion of privacy, a third-degree charge for criminal mischief and a fourth-degree charge for unlawful weapons transport. The invasion of privacy charge related to allegedly distributing a nude or sexual photograph or video of someone without their permission, though police did not specify details relating to the charge. The criminal mischief charge was, according to police, related to tampering with clothing belonging to a woman that formerly lived at the same address as Cunningham. Police said they found a loaded .380 handgun in the glove compartment of Cunningham's Audi following a consensual search. The linebacker, 26, was processed and released without bail, according to police, and is expected to appear in Superior Court in the future. \"We are aware of the situation,\" a team spokesperson said in a statement. \"This is a pending legal matter and we will have no comment.\""]

Phil Kenner and Tommy Constantine have been on trial since May 4 for wire fraud and money laundering. They are accused of diverting the players' investments and other money toward their own personal enrichment. Five players \u2014 Joe Juneau, Michael Peca, Jay McKee, Tyson Nash, and Owen Nolan \u2014 have taken the witness stand for the government so far. Former Ranger and Islander Bryan Berard is also expected to testify as a government witness. Other witnesses have included Peca's wife, Kenner's electrician, a gentleman named John McDonald, from Playboy Enterprises, two of Constantine's lawyers, a race car dealer from Scottsdale, Ariz., and many more. The past week's round of testimony began Tuesday, after a one-week adjournment. The trial could last well into June, and Kenner's attorney, Richard Haley, promised the jury that Kenner will take the stand in his defense. On Tuesday, Alison Ressler of Sullivan & Cromwell, a partner in the firm's Los Angeles office whose mergers and acquisitions expertise does not come cheap, took the stand."]
["sports/i-team", "Ressler was called by the prosecution to testify about having represented Constantine's company in a \"potential acquisition\" of Playboy Enterprises. Ressler said that media executives Chris Albrecht and Steve Bing were part of a team Constantine had put together as part of Constantine LLC's exploration of the deal, which resulted in Ressler's firm billing a total of $155,000 for work over four months that involved what Ressler described dryly as \"a meeting at the Playboy Mansion with Mr. Hefner and his advisors.\" The jury saw billing records showing that on May 26, 2009, Constantine wired $65,000 to Sullivan and Cromwell for his share of the legal fees. The money came from a trust account at the law offices of Ronald Richards, an L.A. attorney who was holding several million dollars of the players' money in what had been billed to the hockey players as a \"Global Settlement Fund.\" The GSF, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent scheme, was supposed to help rescue the players' investments from legal challenges that Kenner and Constantine had told the players were an obstacle to recouping past investments, specifically from a Cabo San Lucas golf course being developed by Kenner's one-time partner, Ken Jowdy. Ressler said her representation of Constantine LLC didn't have anything to do with hockey players or any of the other business ventures the fund's contributors were invested in \u2014 real estate deals in Hawaii and the course in Mexico, or a pre-paid debit card startup called Eufora."]

Much of downtown Ottawa, including the U.S. embassy, was shut down for hours even after the callous gunman was shot dead by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms. The chaos was believed to have been the work of a lone shooter identified by U.S. law enforcement sources as Michael Joseph Hall, a recent convert to Islam who was using the name Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. A friend of the killer described him as \"erratic\" and possibly \"mentally ill\" to a Canadian paper, but cops didn't immediately rule out an accomplice. Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who had been in Parliament when shots rang out, called the mid-morning shooting \"a terrorist\" attack in a brief TV speech Wednesday night. \"This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere,\" he said. He noted it was \"the second time this week (there was) a brutal and violent attack on our soil.\" In New York, the NYPD dispatched police officers to protect Canadian government buildings and the FBI offered to help its northern counterpart."]
