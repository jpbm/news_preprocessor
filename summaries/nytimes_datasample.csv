["us", "Agency Projects Costs of Earthquakes in U.S. - The New York Times While California suffers the most economic harm from earthquakes, cities in other parts of the country, like Seattle, New York, Salt Lake City and St. Louis, are also at risk of heavy damage and should be doing more to prevent such harm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said yesterday. The agency conducted the study, its first nationwide projection of earthquake losses in monetary terms, to guide disaster planners and to show that earthquakes can be as economically devastating as hurricanes and flooding. Researchers reviewed when and how often quakes occur, and the value and condition of buildings in 1994, the latest comprehensive data available. Then they projected the number and strength of earthquakes over hundreds of years -- long enough to account for rare, powerful tremors in places like the East Coast. Based on those computer models, they calculated that earthquakes would cause an average of $4.4 billion in damage and lost income a year in the United States, comparable to the losses from hurricanes. While acknowledging that the condition and value of buildings is likely to change greatly, the study's authors said it would give disaster planners a baseline for understanding how much economic risk their communities face. Magnitude 7 earthquakes, for example, hit Charleston, S.C., in 1886, and off the Atlantic coast of Canada in 1929. A quake that size hitting an East Coast city today would probably cause tens of billions of dollars in damage, much more than if it hit a better-prepared West Coast city."]
["us", "The agency plans similar studies in the next two to three years to predict hurricane and flood damage. When those studies are released, local officials will be better able to prepare, said Dr. Stuart Nishenko, senior seismologist at the agency who was the study's project officer. Because of its large population in quake-prone regions, the West Coast sustains the biggest losses, the study said, with California absorbing almost three-quarters of the damage. The agency's model does not predict losses in any given year but provides a comparison of damage to various cities over centuries. In the projection, Los Angeles suffers the highest loss of any metropolitan area, an average of $1 billion a year. But the damage to the New York City area, averaged over the next 2,500 years, would be only 5 percent of that confronting Los Angeles. Even so, that is the most of any metropolitan area outside of the West Coast, and 11th over all. The estimates include only damage to buildings, not bridges, roads or other infrastructure. In the New York City area, most years there are no earthquakes. But three moderate temblors, about magnitude 5, have struck nearby in the last 300 years, and a quake that size today would probably cause several billion dollars of damage. Dr. Klaus Jacob, a senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and an executive committee member of the New York City Consortium for Earthquake Loss Mitigation, estimated that a magnitude 5 earthquake could cause about $5 billion of damage."]
["us", "''When it gets to a magnitude 6, that's when it gets nasty,'' he said. A quake that size, he said, would cause about $30 billion of damage. In 1995, the city amended its building code to include seismic requirements for new buildings and older buildings undergoing major renovation. Since 1993, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has included seismic retrofits in major renovation work on its bridges."]
["us", "U.S. Moves to End Patchwork of Policies on Returning Ebola Workers - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government on Monday announced a new set of monitoring guidelines for people arriving from West Africa that stopped short of the tough measures instituted in New York and New Jersey last week, an effort to bring uniformity to a messy patchwork of responses by states. The new policy, which federal health officials said was an effort to strike a balance between safety and civil liberties, would require returning heath care workers, or people who had been near Ebola patients, to submit to an in-person checkup and a phone call from a local public health authority. That is looser than the stay-home quarantine policies in New York and New Jersey, and many believed that the long-awaited federal response would be unlikely to satisfy the governors of those states, who believe the government needs to be more proactive in preventing potential Ebola patients from spreading the virus. Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who announced the new measures, said: \"We believed these are based on science. These add a strong level of protection.\u201d But the C.D.C. does not have regulatory authority, and it will be up to states to enforce the policy, and a number of states have already indicated that they believe stronger measures should be taken, including Illinois and Florida."]
["us", "Approximately 100 people a day arrive to the United States from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, most of them American citizens or permanent residents. About 70 percent of the people arrive to six states \u2013 New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia. Dr. Frieden argued that his agency was in discussions with states, but did not specify which ones. \u201cWe found that health departments generally do follow C.D.C. guidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they wish them to be more stringent, that is within their authority.\u201d Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said Monday that his state would begin to monitor travelers arriving from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone for having symptoms consistent with the Ebola virus, and might prohibit returning health workers from taking public transit or attending large gatherings for three weeks after their arrival. Health workers who cared for Ebola patients in West Africa will also be required to sign agreements that restrict their activities, the state said. Those health workers who had \u201cknown breaches of protective protocol\u201d will be required to stay at home for 21 days \u2014 with the possibility of mandatory quarantine, Mr. McAuliffe said in a statement. Health care workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa will be \u201cevaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be restricted from public transportation, mass gatherings, and clinical care,\u201d the statement said. All travelers arriving in Virginia from the three West African nations will be asked to take and record their temperature at least twice each day, with local health officials contacting them daily for three weeks to check on their condition."]
["us", "Even if a traveler has tested negative for the virus, but develops symptoms that suggest Ebola has been contracted, Mr. McAuliffe said the traveler might be asked to remain at home for 21 days under the close supervision of state health officials. In announcing the new policy for returning health care workers, federal officials are seeking to strike a delicate balance between getting the medical details right and making sure the public is comfortable with the approach the government is taking. This is important because, should the virus begin to spread, health workers will need the public to trust them enough to reveal information. \u201cIf something is going to scare someone, an Ebola guy on the subway is a pretty good way,\u201d said Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. \u201cYou have to be concerned with the public ramification of your actions.\u201d The differences between the federal government and the governors have already erupted into a political test of wills just days before the midterm elections. Administration officials over the weekend harshly criticized the quarantine plans in New York and New Jersey, saying they went too far and could have the unintended consequence of discouraging health care workers from going to West Africa. But Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, have refused to back down, saying they are putting in place policies that they think are necessary to protect the public."]

["world/asia", "Pakistani Cricket Star Tries Again to Turn Adulation Into Political Support - The New York Times LAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 Imran Khan, a Pakistani cricket star turned politician, kicked off his populist campaign for national elections with a huge rally here on Saturday, a national holiday, in a symbolic move timed to tap into surging nationalist sentiment and bolster his political party, which has never won more than a single seat in Parliament and is flagging in the polls. Officials of Mr. Khan\u2019s party had expected a record number of people to attend the event here in Lahore, an eastern city known as the political capital of Pakistan. \u201cWe are expecting 400,000 to 500,000 people,\u201d Hamid Khan, a lawyer and a leader of the party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or the Movement for Justice, said in an interview Saturday afternoon before the rally. \u201cToday\u2019s event will be a game changer,\u201d said Mr. Khan, the lawyer, who is no relation to the politician. \u201cIt will be a harbinger of change against status quo forces.\u201d But a much smaller crowd turned up, estimated at just over 100,000. The rally ended abruptly Saturday evening under heavy rain and thunder, and Imran Khan had to cut short his speech. \u201cChange is not about to come,\u201d Mr. Khan said to thunderous applause, promising to never use public office for personal gains. \u201cChange has arrived.\u201d \u201cI will keep all of my wealth inside Pakistan,\u201d he said, in a veiled criticism of his political opponents. \u201cI will not set up factories abroad.\u201d"]
["world/asia", "He said he had entered politics because he was worried about the nation\u2019s youth. \u201cYou have to stand by me to fight injustice and tyranny,\u201d he exhorted the crowd. Mr. Khan chose March 23, a national holiday known as Republic Day, to begin his campaign ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for May 11. If Mr. Khan were elected to Parliament, and his party were to win a plurality of seats, he could become the next prime minister, though analysts say there is little chance of that. Mr. Khan, 60, who retains his youthful swagger and athletic physique, is particularly popular with young Pakistanis, who form the core of his support and make up approximately 40 percent of the country\u2019s registered voters. However, it was not clear how much of this adulation \u2014 which borders on the cultlike \u2014 would translate into electoral success. On Saturday. the crowd erupted in an impassioned frenzy as pop stars took turns on the stage to sing between the political speeches. Young men and women sang along loudly, throwing their arms up in the air and waving party flags. \u201cWe have had enough with traditional politicians,\u201d said Faisal Younis, 38, a textile trader from Lahore. He said the mainstream parties had had their shot. \u201cNow, others should get a chance.\u201dMr. Khan outstrips his opponents in public popularity, but his party has won only one seat in Parliament since it was founded in 1996 with an aim to challenge entrenched politics and establish accountability and justice. He was elected to Parliament in 2002, but languished on the political sidelines for years before being catapulted to the political forefront in October 2011, when a spontaneous and enthusiastic public response to a rally in Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab Province, drew at least 100,000 people."]
["world/asia", "Mr. Khan\u2019s populist slogans and antiwar statements have increased his appeal to voters unnerved by a spate of terrorist attacks and disillusioned by a crippled economy. After the 2011 rally, many politicians and political hopefuls asked to join his ranks, and Mr. Khan, who had spurned almost all politicians, welcomed most of the newcomers, even some who had been tainted with charges of corruption. After that, Mr. Khan\u2019s popularity plummeted as Pakistanis accused him of compromising his earlier principled stand. A poll released in January by the International Republican Institute put the approval rating for Mr. Khan\u2019s party at 18 percent. His main rival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif \u2014 whose party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, hopes to form the next government \u2014 had an approval rating of 32 percent. The Pakistan Peoples Party, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, came in last with 14 percent. The campaign kickoff is being seen as a bellwether of larger national political trends. Political analysts say that any electoral gains Mr. Khan wins will eat into the political territory that has generally been considered Mr. Sharif\u2019s home base: Punjab. Lahore is the hometown of both Mr. Khan and Mr. Sharif. Punjab, the most populous and prosperous of the country\u2019s four provinces, decides the political outcome of any election. The party that wins a majority in Punjab is almost guaranteed to win the right to form a new government."]
["world/asia", "But analysts see Mr. Khan\u2019s party as essentially a spoiler, saying that even if it siphons off votes from Mr. Sharif\u2019s party, it will not prevail in the general elections. The Pakistan Peoples Party will end up reaping the benefit, they say. Mr. Khan\u2019s and Mr. Sharif\u2019s parties are \u201caiming at the same conservative Punjab-dominated vote bank,\u201d Najam Sethi, a veteran journalist, said in an editorial in The Friday Times, a Lahore-based weekly. If Mr. Khan\u2019s party is able to take votes away from Mr. Sharif\u2019s, the net gainer will be the Pakistan Peoples Party, he said. Arif Rafiq, a commentator on Pakistani politics and an adjunct scholar with the Middle East Institute, said in an e-mail, \u201cThere are a lot of ways the election results and postelection coalition-making could go. A weaker Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz could put the Pakistan Peoples Party in a better position to form a coalition, Mr. Rafiq said. And the Nawaz party, even if it gains a plurality in Parliament, \u201ccould have difficulty finding coalition partners,\u201d he said. Officials of Imran Khan\u2019s party dismissed such criticism. \u201cThere is an attempt to cut the importance and significance of P.T.I.,\u201d said Mr. Khan, the lawyer. In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provinces, he said, Mr. Khan\u2019s and Mr. Sharif\u2019s parties will be the main competitors, and the Pakistan Peoples Party \u201cis not figuring anywhere.\u201d"]

["world/middleeast", "Islamist Rebels\u2019 Gains in Syria Create Dilemma for U.S. - The New York Times CAIRO \u2014 In Syria\u2019s largest city, Aleppo, rebels aligned with Al Qaeda control the power plant, run the bakeries and head a court that applies Islamic law. Elsewhere, they have seized government oil fields, put employees back to work and now profit from the crude they produce. Across Syria, rebel-held areas are dotted with Islamic courts staffed by lawyers and clerics, and by fighting brigades led by extremists. Even the Supreme Military Council, the umbrella rebel organization whose formation the West had hoped would sideline radical groups, is stocked with commanders who want to infuse Islamic law into a future Syrian government. Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there a secular fighting force to speak of. This is the landscape President Obama confronts as he considers how to respond to growing evidence that Syrian officials have used chemical weapons, crossing a \u201cred line\u201d he had set. More than two years of violence have radicalized the armed opposition fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, leaving few groups that both share the political vision of the United States and have the military might to push it forward. Among the most extreme groups is the notorious Al Nusra Front, the Qaeda-aligned force declared a terrorist organization by the United States, but other groups share aspects of its Islamist ideology in varying degrees."]
["world/middleeast", "\u201cSome of the more extremist opposition is very scary from an American perspective, and that presents us with all sorts of problems,\u201d said Ari Ratner, a fellow at the Truman National Security Project and former Middle East adviser in the Obama State Department. \u201cWe have no illusions about the prospect of engaging with the Assad regime \u2014 it must still go \u2014 but we are also very reticent to support the more hard-line rebels.\u201d Syrian officials recognize that the United States is worried that it has few natural allies in the armed opposition and have tried to exploit that with a public campaign to convince, or frighten, Washington into staying out of the fight. At every turn they promote the notion that the alternative to Mr. Assad is an extremist Islamic state. The Islamist character of the opposition reflects the main constituency of the rebellion, which has been led since its start by Syria\u2019s Sunni Muslim majority, mostly in conservative, marginalized areas. The descent into brutal civil war has hardened sectarian differences, and the failure of more mainstream rebel groups to secure regular arms supplies has allowed Islamists to fill the void and win supporters. The religious agenda of the combatants sets them apart from many civilian activists, protesters and aid workers who had hoped the uprising would create a civil, democratic Syria."]
["world/middleeast", "When the armed rebellion began, defectors from the government\u2019s staunchly secular army formed the vanguard. The rebel movement has since grown to include fighters with a wide range of views, including Qaeda-aligned jihadis seeking to establish an Islamic emirate, political Islamists inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood and others who want an Islamic-influenced legal code like that found in many Arab states. \u201cMy sense is that there are no seculars,\u201d said Elizabeth O\u2019Bagy, of the Institute for the Study of War, who has made numerous trips to Syria in recent months to interview rebel commanders. Of most concern to the United States is the Nusra Front, whose leader recently confirmed that the group cooperated with Al Qaeda in Iraq and pledged fealty to Al Qaeda\u2019s top leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden\u2019s longtime deputy. Nusra has claimed responsibility for a number of suicide bombings and is the group of choice for the foreign jihadis pouring into Syria. Another prominent group, Ahrar al-Sham, shares much of Nusra\u2019s extremist ideology but is made up mostly of Syrians. The two groups are most active in the north and east and are widely respected by other rebels for their fighting abilities and their ample arsenal, much of it given by sympathetic donors in the gulf. And both helped lead campaigns to seize military bases, dams on the Euphrates River and the provincial capital of Raqqa Province in March, the only regional capital entirely held by rebel forces."]
["world/middleeast", "Nusra\u2019s hand is felt most strongly in Aleppo, where the group has set up camp in a former children\u2019s hospital and has worked with other rebel groups to establish a Shariah Commission in the eye hospital next door to govern the city\u2019s rebel-held neighborhoods. The commission runs a police force and an Islamic court that hands down sentences that have included lashings, though not amputations or executions as some Shariah courts in other countries have done. Nusra fighters also control the power plant and distribute flour to keep the city\u2019s bakeries running. While many residents initially feared them, some have come to respect them for providing basic services and working to fill the city\u2019s security vacuum. Secular activists, however, have chafed at their presence. At times, Nusra fighters have clashed with other rebels who reject their ideology. In the oil-rich provinces of Deir al-Zour and Hasaka, Nusra fighters have seized government oil fields, putting some under the control of tribal militias and running others themselves. \u201cThey are the strongest military force in the area,\u201d said the commander of a rebel brigade in Hasaka reached via Skype. \u201cWe can\u2019t deny it.\u201d But most of Nusra\u2019s fighters joined the group for the weapons, not the ideology, he said, and some left after discovering the Qaeda connection. \u201cMost of the youth who joined them did so to topple the regime, not because they wanted to join Al Qaeda,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation."]
["world/middleeast", "As extremists rose in the rebel ranks, the United States sought to limit their influence, first by designating Nusra a terrorist organization, and later by pushing for the formation of the Supreme Military Council, which is linked to the exile opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition. Although led by an army defector, Gen. Salim Idris, the council has taken in the leaders of many overtly Islamist battalions. One called the Syrian Liberation Front has been integrated nearly wholesale into the council; many of its members coordinate closely with the Syrian Islamic Front, a group that includes the extremist Ahrar al-Sham, according to a recent report by Ms. O\u2019Bagy, of the Institute for the Study of War. A spokesman for the council, Louay Mekdad, said that its members reflected Syrian society and that it had no ties to Nusra or other radical groups. \u201cThe character of the Syrian people is Islamic, but it is stupid to think that Syria will turn into Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just an excuse for those who don\u2019t want to help Syria.\u201d The Obama administration has said it needs more conclusive information before it acts on the Syrian government\u2019s reported use of chemical weapons. It remains unclear whether such action would translate to increased support for the rebels.

The challenge, he said, is to end the conflict before \u201cthe opportunity to create a system of governance not based on militant Islamic law is lost.\u201d Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, framed the rebels\u2019 dilemma another way: \u201cHow do you denounce the Nusra Front as extremists when they are playing such an important military role and when they look disciplined, resourceful and committed?\u201d From the start, the Syrian government has sought to portray the rebels as terrorists carrying out an international plot to weaken the country, and the rise of extremist groups has strengthened its case and increased support among Syrians who fear that a rebel victory could mean the end of the secular Syrian state. Many rebels and opposition activists complain about the Western focus on Islamist groups, some even dismissing the opposition\u2019s ideological differences. \u201cWe all want an Islamic state and we want Shariah to be applied,\u201d said Maawiya Hassan Agha, a rebel activist reached by Skype in the northern village of Sarmeen.

The president\u2019s supporters counter that since Mr. Nkurunziza was elected by Parliament in 2005, not by popular vote, he is eligible to run for another term. Mr. Nkurunziza did not take questions at the news conference on Sunday, and the brief statement he read in French did not address the political crisis. Even so, its shadow lingered over the capital.

["sports/baseball", "Nationals Play D.J. and Try to Make Mets Feel Like Dust in the Wind   - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014  When the Washington Nationals finished batting practice here on Wednesday at Nationals Park and the Mets took the field, the slow, soothing tones of \u201cRainy Days and Mondays,\u201d by the Carpenters, came over the loudspeakers. Some Mets around the batting cage looked at one another and laughed. It was a stark change from the upbeat, contemporary music that had been playing while the Nationals batted, the kind of soundtrack played at baseball games everywhere. All of this was by design. Starting this season, for now at least, the Nationals are playing slow soft-rock songs during the visiting team\u2019s batting practice. As if their standout starting rotation were not daunting enough, the Nationals are also trying to gain a psychological edge on their opponents, at least in some small way. Because the Mets were in town for the first series of the season, they served as guinea pigs. Over three games, they heard the Carpenters, Elton John, Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O\u2019Connor, R.E.M. and Kansas (\u201cDust in the Wind\u201d). It was the type of music designed to lull, to pacify, the type of music that was not played at ballparks even when it was contemporary. At one point, Kevin Long, the Mets\u2019 hitting coach, turned to someone and said, \u201cIs that George Michael?\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "Some Mets claimed not to hear the songs. But their general strategy during the three-game series was to laugh it off. On Wednesday, when the Carpenters came on, Long turned toward the Nationals\u2019 dugout, smiled and shouted: \u201cWe\u2019re not buying this! You can\u2019t bring us down!\u201d \u201cYou laugh at it, go along with it and don\u2019t let it affect you one way or another,\u201d Long said later. \u201cYou have it, psychologically, play in your favor somehow.\u201d Julia Kim, a clinical psychologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said in a phone interview that the slower music the Nationals drenched the Mets with would not necessarily have a noticeable effect. Upbeat music is energizing, and positive lyrics can create positive thoughts, Kim said. But slower music can help some players slow down and relax, which is not a bad thing. The question is whether any Nationals\u2019 opponents will become too relaxed while listening to an unrelenting playlist of soothing tunes. \u201cIt\u2019s very individualized,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt depends on the music, depends on what you like. But it also depends on if you believe it. If you believe that music is going to affect your performance, it will.\u201d During the series with the Mets, the batting-practice music designed to harass them added a quirky feel to the ballpark. Because the gates are typically opened around the same time that the visiting players take the field to get in their swings, the fans were greeted by slow, heartfelt ballads that sounded more appropriate for a karaoke bar."]
["sports/baseball", "\u201cWe like to be fun and creative with our in-game entertainment, and the songs we play during visiting team batting practice is part of the show,\u201d Valerie Camillo, the Nationals\u2019 chief revenue and marketing officer, said in a statement. \u201cHopefully, our fans will find it funny, and maybe we can even get a smile out of some of the visiting team players,\u201d she added. This kind of strategy is not rare. Teams are always looking for an edge. The Yankees often play their own highlights during the visiting team\u2019s batting practice. And in San Diego on Thursday, as the Padres prepared for their home opener against the champion San Francisco Giants, the home team took batting practice to a bouncy salsa tune. When it was the Giants\u2019 turn, the music shifted to organ renditions of \u201cRoll Out the Barrels\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World.\u201d At Citi Field, the Mets play the same type of music for both teams. Maybe that has been their problem. At least two Mets, Curtis Granderson and Daniel Murphy, said they had not heard the Nationals\u2019 music over the last few days. David Wright said he was typically so focused that he tuned everything out. And the Mets, to their credit, won the series, two games to one. (It did not hurt that Matt Harvey cranked up the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in the Mets\u2019 clubhouse on Thursday before he went out and shut down the Nationals for six innings.)"]
["sports/baseball", "\u201cWhatever they want to do,\u201d Wright said, brushing away the Nationals\u2019 stunt. \u201cIf teams want to try to gain however slight an advantage, why not?

The music took him back to his youth. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t fire you up, what will?\u201d he said to his batters at one point. Kim noted that professional athletes were trained to deal with a variety of variables. They travel on long trips; frequently sleep in hotels; deal with the news media, fans and issues at home; and, no matter what, are expected to produce. They are playing at this level, in part, because of their intense focus, she added. \u201cBut, you know,\u201d she said, \u201cevery little bit counts.\u201d"]

["dining", "Cava Sparkles on Its Own Merits - The New York Times Briskly uncork a bottle of cava, the sparkling wine of Spain, and you will hear the festive pop so dear to revelers around the globe. Ease it open ever so slowly, and instead you\u2019ll hear the soft, contented sigh that may signal an evening of sparkling romance. Either way, they are the sounds automatically associated with Champagne. Yet cava is something altogether different, sparkling wine from a Catalonian viewpoint. Just about anywhere in the world where wine is made, sparkling wine is made, too. Very little of it has to do with Champagne, beyond the obvious cue of the bubbles. Yet consumers so often lump all sparkling wines into one large group with distinctions only by price: Champagne and cheaper Champagne alternatives. It makes as much sense as assuming all white wine is the same because it more or less shares the same color. Despite the bubbles in common, you will taste no two wines more different than, for example, prosecco and sparkling Vouvray. They come from different places, are made of different grapes, employ different methods of production, express entirely different cultures and, in the end, smell, taste and feel different. You can draw the same distinctions about most sparkling wines. Not everything with wheels is a car. Welcome back to Wine School, where the taxonomy of wines is not simply a matter of superficial categorization, but of taking careful note of real, discernible differences."]
["dining", "Here\u2019s how it works: Each month, I pick a category of wine and suggest a few representative examples. Over the course of the next few weeks, you acquire one or more of the bottles and drink them in a congenial environment with food, family and friends, paying close attention to your own experience. The next month, we convene here again and discuss the wines. I hope you will post your observations along the way at nytimes.com/food. Careful observation is the key. While it\u2019s entirely possible, and often preferable, simply to enjoy wine without thinking too hard about it, an even greater pleasure comes from noticing its nuances and distinctions. The ability to do this comes not from having special powers of taste or smell, but from the habit of observation. As with cooks who no longer require the guidance of recipes as they become more comfortable and experienced in the kitchen, so it is with wine drinkers. The more varieties of wines you drink and scrutinize, the easier it becomes to articulate their characteristics and what appeals to your own taste. Cava is a case in point. It is not only a victim of its association with other sparkling wines, it is also guilty of a checkered past. Cava is produced by the millions of bottles, and much of it is not very good, the product of an ethos that values quantity over quality."]
["dining", "I spent some formative years drinking bad cava because it was a sparkling wine that I could afford, and it did not leave a good taste. It took quite a while \u2014 within the last decade, really \u2014 before I tried a cava that changed my mind. But eventually, between drinking cavas that changed my mind and visiting cava country in the Pened\u00e8s region of Catalonia, I learned that cava could be wonderful if the grapes were farmed conscientiously and the wine made with utmost care. Cava, in fact, shares the same production method as Champagne. After the grapes are made into a still wine, that wine is bottled and a secondary fermentation is induced in the sealed bottle. With no means of escape, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of that fermentation, provides the sparkle. Where cava differs from other sparkling wines is both in the grapes and in the places they are grown. The primary grape of cava, xarello, is grown almost nowhere else in the world but Catalonia. It\u2019s subtle, and when grown with care expresses the characteristics of its terroir. Many grapes are permitted in cava, including the Champagne duo of pinot noir and chardonnay, but the best and most distinctive cavas are made of xarello along with two other grapes, macabeo and parellada. Cava can legally be made anywhere in Spain, but most of it, including the best versions, come from the Pened\u00e8s. This lack of rigorous standards for cava has prompted some producers to remove themselves from the oversight of the cava authorities. These producers, including Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc, one of my suggested producers, effectively make cava, but they do not call their wines cava."]
["dining", "The three wines I suggested, the Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc de Nit 2012, the Gramona Gran Cuv\u00e9e Brut 2009 and the Recaredo Gran Reserva Brut Nature 2008, are each entirely different, giving a taste of the range of possibilities available to cava producers. The Ravent\u00f3s, in fact, is a ros\u00e9, a combination of the three classic cava grapes with 5 percent monastrell, known in French-speaking circles as mourv\u00e8dre, which adds the color and some complexity. It\u2019s a terrific wine: fresh, lively, dry and tangy with the hint of an underlying berry flavor. Several readers suggested that the color may have influenced their perception of a berry flavor. This is entirely possible. Colors have been shown to stimulate moods, so why not flavors? Still, it seemed real to me. The Ravent\u00f3s is not only younger than the other cavas, but it was also fermented and aged briefly in steel tanks before returning to the bottle for its second fermentation. The 2009 Gramona was made entirely differently. It has a significant portion of chardonnay in the blend, 30 percent. And the wine was aged in French oak barrels for a year, then received significant bottle aging. Both of these factors account for the wine\u2019s toasty flavors and rich texture. It is a more voluminous wine than the others: more spicy, less herbal, yet balanced and graceful."]
["dining", "The third cava, and the best in my opinion, was the Recaredo. It, too, had some barrel aging, but the toastiness was more subtle than in the Gramona, the flavors more steely, herbal and mineral. I loved the lacy texture of the Recaredo and its great finesse. Yet it was substantial as well, with flavors that remained long after I swallowed. Its bubbles, as one reader, Dan Barron of New York, pointed out, were the finest of the three. I was happy to see that several readers found their reintroduction to cava a revelation. \u201cI had pretty much abandoned cava as a sparkling alternative,\u201d David Stalder of Las Vegas wrote. \u201cI won\u2019t shy away from it in the future.\u201d Rick J P of Vancouver, British Columbia, got a firsthand lesson in the difference between good and generic cavas. The generic bottles, he found, were not bad, just one-dimensional. \u201cThe Ravent\u00f3s, on the other hand,\u201d he said, \u201cwas multilayered and exceptional.\u201d It is important to remember that these are entry-level cavas from among the best producers. Each makes even better bottles that are still relatively inexpensive. One reader, JKM of Washington, stepped it up by buying Gramona\u2019s Imperial Gran Reserva 2007, made with a much smaller proportion of chardonnay and aged longer, which sells for about $30 in New York. He loved it. \u201cThe wine was a different beast compared to those I\u2019ve purchased from supermarket shelves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith Champagne commanding ever higher prices, being able to purchase a gem like this for half the price seems almost criminal. Not that I mind.\u201d"]
["dining", "Ah, the comparison with Champagne. I suppose it\u2019s inevitable. Yet I do hope one day that selecting a cava will not be simply a matter of price, but of a desire for its winning characteristics. Then cava will have gotten its due."]
["science", "Old Teeth Tell New Stories About People Who Didn\u2019t Get Enough Sun - The New York Times You don\u2019t just have teeth in your mouth: You have around 32 fossils that tell a microscopic history of your health. And scientists have found that even the old, discarded, not-so-pearly whites of people that lived hundreds of years ago tell a story about them, too. According to a paper published Monday in The Journal of Archaeological Science, the researchers discovered a permanent record of vitamin D deficiency in the microscopic structure of old teeth and shed new light on the daily challenges faced by people of the past. When the body doesn\u2019t get enough vitamin D from the sun or food, they found, teeth develop gaps or bubbles in dentin, the layer under enamel that makes up about 85 percent of a tooth\u2019s structure. These abnormalities reveal stories not just about past environmental conditions or food availability, but about culture and society as well. Throughout history and across the world, there have been epidemics of children with rickets, a disease characterized by bowed legs and deformed hips, caused in part by a lack of sunlight. Anthropologists have identified rickets outbreaks by examining skeletal remains in places at high latitudes with limited access to sunlight, like some in England, Canada or France. But the vast majority of children who had rickets will outgrow it. That makes the dental record of the condition important because abnormalities within teeth don\u2019t disappear with age, as evidence of bowed legs, for example, can, in adult bones. Understanding rickets outbreaks in the past can help in the study of children\u2019s health today."]
["science", "The researchers, led by Megan Brickley, an anthropologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, examined the skeletal remains of six individuals who had been buried in the 18th and 19th centuries in cemeteries known to contain cases of rickets and individuals who had survived childhood vitamin D deficiencies. The team determined who likely had rickets from their bones and then analyzed their teeth, cutting each tooth into several transparent slices, thinner than a sheet of tissue paper, and examining them under microscopes. They found that a 24-year-old man who had been buried in Quebec between 1771 and 1860 had suffered four bouts of rickets in his short life: twice before the age of 2, once again around the age of 6, and again, in a somewhat severe episode, around the age of 12. Evidence of this final episode in his third molar correlated with an abnormal curvature in his tailbone that only could have developed around the same time. \u201cWe were able to see inside that tooth, what was housed in there, years ago,\u201d said Dr. Brickley. They reached this precision because teeth develop at different rates and leave behind concentric circles like tree rings over time. The researchers could look at the abnormalities within those layers to estimate occurrence and severity. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that info from a skeleton,\u201d said Lori D\u2019Ortenzio, a paleopathologist who worked on the study."]
["science", "Lynne Schepartz, an anthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa who specializes in prehistoric health and was not involved in the study found the results exciting. Studying vitamin D deficiencies in teeth, she said, could reveal information about limited access to sunlight among certain populations as a result of labor roles, culture or social status. But the insights aren\u2019t limited to the past. It\u2019s estimated that more than a billion people worldwide don\u2019t get enough vitamin D, and around the world rickets still can affect up to 9 percent of the childhood population in some places. Knowing about the past and lifestyle factors that led to rickets in particular communities worldwide may help put what\u2019s happening today into historical context. In Britain, for example, rickets is on the rise. The fact that vitamin D deficiency could be recorded in teeth, \u201cwas certainly news to me,\u201d John Middleton, president of Britain\u2019s Faculty of Public Health, wrote in an email. \u201cWe are concerned about dietary deficiency, lack of dairy, fish and meat, and particularly lack of sunlight for children who spend all their time indoors watching TV or playing video games,\u201d he said. This may not be so abnormal \u2014 in the past, Victorian smog, poor nutrition, working indoors, and clothing that covered most of the body contributed to rickets. Now with records from teeth, it\u2019s possible to find even more cases in adults that were previously missed."]
["science", "The opportunity to access never-before-told stories trapped within molars that started growing when a fetus was still inside the womb also may contribute to conversations around an idea called the Barker Hypothesis, which says that conditions in the womb contribute to development of diseases later in life. The World Health Organization currently warns mothers about vitamin D deficiency, which is common during pregnancy and linked to poor health outcomes for both mother and child. Dr. Brickley said archaeological evidence from the molars of those no longer living could provide new links between prenatal vitamin D deficiency and early death or chronic disease."]
["well/family", "Travelers With Nut Allergies Clash With Airlines - The New York Times Rosanne Bloom and her family had just settled into their seats on a flight from Philadelphia to Turks and Caicos Islands on Christmas morning when two airline employees ordered Dr. Bloom, her husband and two boys off the plane. Their luggage had already been removed. The problem? Dr. Bloom had informed the crew that her teenage sons had severe nut allergies. \u201cI said, \u2018We have our medicine. We brought our own food, and we\u2019re comfortable staying on the plane.\u2019 I offered to sign a waiver,\u201d said Dr. Bloom, an orthodontist in Clarksville, Md. \u201cWe were off the plane in two minutes.\u201d Matt Miller, a spokesman for American Airlines, said such decisions are left to the pilot. \u201cThe pilot determined it would be best for the family not to travel based on the severity of the allergy and the need to divert the airline if anyone were eating nuts,\u201d he said. Airline carriers have a long tradition of serving peanuts on flights, and often serve little else. But the practice also presents a challenge to travelers with severe nut allergies, who can suffer a reaction simply by touching a surface that has been exposed to nuts. But tensions between passengers with food allergies and airline staff members have risen in recent years, as airlines have begun to enforce stricter rules related to preboarding passengers. In the past, parents of young children could board the plane early, giving them a chance to wipe down seats, trays and armrests to reduce exposure to allergens. But today many airlines have stopped letting families with children board before other passengers."]
["well/family", "When families request permission to preboard \u2014 or pose another request, such as asking whether nuts will be served \u2014 they risk being taken off the flight or threatened with removal, said Mary Vargas, a lawyer whose family was almost kept off a plane from London back to the United States in December because of a nut allergy. Now families with nut allergies are waging a legal challenge against such policies. Two formal complaints filed with the Department of Transportation in the last month accuse American Airlines of discrimination against passengers with allergies. The complaints cite the airline\u2019s preboarding policy, which  prohibits preboarding specifically for people with allergies, and not for others. \u201cThis is about being allowed to fly like everybody else in the United States,\u201d said Ms. Vargas, the lawyer representing the families. Although nobody tracks medical emergencies on airplanes, studies show that in-flight medical emergencies are relatively uncommon and affect only a fraction of the estimated 3.6 billion passengers who fly each year. Chest pain and cardiovascular events are the most common reason planes are diverted for a medical emergency. Allergic reactions make up fewer than 4 percent of all in-flight medical emergencies, according to a 2013 study published in the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine. Notably, American Airlines, which operates one of the largest fleets of planes in the world, does not even serve peanuts. But it does have a peanut policy, in which it states: \u201cRequests that we not serve any particular foods, including tree nuts, on our flights cannot be granted.

["well/family", "\u201cUltimately we cannot guarantee customers will not be exposed to peanuts or other nuts during the flight, and allowing people with nut allergies to preboard can create a false sense of security and does not eliminate risk,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Individuals who suffer from severe, life-threatening food allergies can experience swelling and difficulty breathing after even a mild exposure. They usually carry an Epi-Pen, which contains epinephrine, a medication that can reverse the symptoms. But in the case of a severe reaction, a person may still need urgent access to a medical facility. Research has shown that taking steps like creating buffer zones, in which nearby passengers are asked to refrain from eating nut products, and wiping down seats and trays may reduce the risk of an allergic reaction in flight. One of the complaints, filed on Dec. 28, is from Nicole Mackenzie, the mother of a 7-year-old with life-threatening allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and seeds. She was not allowed to preboard to clean the seat before the family\u2019s trip last fall from Portland, Ore., to Charlotte, N.C. The second complaint was filed on Jan. 10 on behalf of Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), an organization that represents individuals with all kinds of food allergies. \u201cAmerican Airlines\u2019s action was clearly discriminatory,\u201d said FARE\u2019s chief executive officer and chief medical officer, Dr. James Baker Jr. \u201cIt has a defined policy that they put on their website, and the only people they single out from preboarding are people with food allergies.\u201d"]

Southwest will avoid serving peanuts if flight attendants know an allergic passenger is on board. Delta\u2019s policy is also to refrain from serving peanuts if an allergic passenger is onboard.

["science", "At Risk: When Parents Say No to Vaccinations - The New York Times Colorado children whose parents decided against measles and pertussis vaccinations not only contracted the diseases at sharply higher rates than vaccinated children, but they also appear to have increased the risk of infection for their peers, according to a study published last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association. About half the states allow parents to seek exemptions for religious, medical or philosophical reasons from vaccination requirements for entry to schools or day care centers, and the number of these requests has been increasing. A team of researchers led by Dr. Daniel R. Feiken of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to use Colorado to study the consequences of such exemptions. In 1998, Colorado granted exemptions to 2 percent of eligible children, twice the national average. After analyzing health data for children 3 to 8 years old between 1987 and 1998, they concluded that the risk of measles was 22 times as high for unvaccinated children and that the risk of pertussis, or whooping cough, was nearly 6 times as high. They also found that vaccinated children appeared to be affected by the exemptions. In counties with the greatest number of exempt children, the measles rate among vaccinated children was about 50 percent higher than elsewhere, the researchers said. Schools with higher numbers of exempt children reported more outbreaks of pertussis, and they calculated that at least 11 percent of vaccinated children who came down with measles in a school outbreak had acquired the disease through contact with an exempt child."]

In the ensuing celebration during the first half on Saturday, Gary Lewin, England\u2019s physiotherapist, jumped in the air, landed on a water bottle and dislocated his ankle. Eventually, Coach Roy Hodgson\u2019s attempt to blend experience with dauntless youth brought great enthusiasm but neither victory nor even a draw. Instead, England lost, 2-1, to Italy, a four-time champion, its defense wilting in the heat and humidity of the Amazon rain forest.

During a debate about whether to extend pub hours for the tournament, the Home Office said there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that England would exit before the late rounds. The skepticism seemed warranted Saturday. England attacked with vigor, but it also seemed vulnerable to the next pass, the next creative thought, by the patient and incisive Italians, who played without their injured goalkeeper and captain, Gianluigi Buffon. In the 35th minute, a clever stepover move by Andrea Pirlo let a pass through to Claudio Marchisio above the penalty area. His low, hard shot found its way through a rain forest of legs to put Italy ahead, 1-0. England tied the score two minutes later as Daniel Sturridge half-volleyed a cross from Wayne Rooney. But the celebration ended with England\u2019s physiotherapist being taken off on a stretcher. \u201cIt\u2019s a really sad moment for us,\u201d Hodgson said.

If public hope merely simmered instead of boiled for England as this World Cup opened, so did the pressure. Hodgson found Saturday the perfect time to introduce the speed and skill and exuberance of players like Raheem Sterling, 19, who started behind Sturridge in England\u2019s 4-2-3-1 attack. Sterling appeared fearless, threatening with an early shot, starting the counterattack that led to Sturridge\u2019s goal. But Rooney, 28, will not soon escape scrutiny. He is England\u2019s best and most heavily criticized player. In two previous World Cups, he accumulated one red card and zero goals. Some called for Rooney to be benched against Italy.

["nyregion", "Suspensions Keep Falling in New York City\u2019s Schools - The New York Times Suspensions at New York City public schools continued to decline last year, the Education Department announced on Thursday, a key measure of efforts to change school discipline practices. Suspensions fell nearly 32 percent from July to December 2015, compared with the same period the year before, the department said. Mayor Bill de Blasio made school-discipline reform an issue during his campaign. An embrace of strict discipline policies during the 1990s led to rising suspensions, but in recent years, educators have focused on other approaches that help keep students in school. Since Mr. de Blasio took office, the city has taken several measures intended to modify school discipline and cut the number of suspensions, which had begun to fall during Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure. The city has provided additional staff and training for alternatives to traditional punishments, including techniques that encourage students to talk about a conflict rather than sending them out of the room. And the New York Police Department is developing a system for evaluating which schools require metal detectors, and where they can be removed. Last year, the city made it more difficult for administrators to suspend students for defying authority, a practice that reform advocates had been pushing to abolish for years. The Education Department said on Thursday that those suspensions had dropped 81 percent from July to December, making it the biggest single contributor to the drop in suspensions over all."]

["realestate", "Using Data to Find a New York Suburb That Fits - The New York Times When Eugenia Spektor and her husband decided it was time to leave Long Island City for the suburbs, they knew the kind of community they wanted to live in, but weren\u2019t sure they could find it. Their list of wants was straightforward: good public schools for their two children, a train commute of no more than an hour, walking distance to town, an easygoing atmosphere. The characteristics they hoped to avoid were harder to divine: success-crazed moms, high-pressure schools and, since they work full time, a predominance of stay-at-home parents. Both from outside the tristate area, the Spektors were overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to distinguish among the hundreds of commuter towns surrounding New York. So they turned to Suburban Jungle Realty Group, a personal relocation firm that works one-on-one with city dwellers looking to move to the \u201cright\u201d suburb. Though a licensed brokerage, Suburban Jungle acts more as a savvy guide, says the company founder, Alison Bernstein. Staff members interview clients in depth about their needs, values and lifestyle \u2014 liberal or conservative? Full-day or half-day kindergarten? Summers away or at home? Then it suggests some potentially appropriate towns. Clients are referred to outside real estate agents (who split their commission with Suburban Jungle if they sell a home), and can meet with designated resident \u201cconsultants\u201d to talk in more detail about what a particular community is like."]
["realestate", "\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t understand the nuances of the area, their help was invaluable,\u201d said Ms. Spektor, who works in arts administration at a museum. Though novel in its business model, Suburban Jungle is part of a controversial industry trend that caters to home buyers who have both the desire and the ability to cherry-pick their surroundings. Other real estate websites are supplying home buyers with loads of hyper-specific community data, including racial makeup, percent of married households and education level. Because these sites, if not actually brokerages, are linked to home sales, they have attracted the attention of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is charged with enforcing fair housing laws. Ms. Bernstein said her service abides by the same ethical guidelines as any real estate agency would, but her staff can be more objective. They aren\u2019t necessarily licensed agents because, she said, \u201chaving a license really conflicts with what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d Sales agents, she said, don\u2019t necessarily care \u201cwhether you\u2019re better off in Chatham, N.J. or Rye, N.Y.\u201d Ms. Spektor said Suburban Jungle gave her information she would have been hard-pressed to uncover herself.

Real estate websites \u2014 the largest being Zillow and Trulia \u2014 also are elevating the importance of \u201clocation, location, location\u201d to new heights by offering data that allows home buyers to scrutinize communities or neighborhoods in any way they like. Want to find a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d community within 20 miles of Boston with a high Asian population, a low poverty rate and a median home value of $400,000?

What if you\u2019re curious about a neighborhood\u2019s crime rate? On Trulia.com, you can pull up a heat map that shows the level of crime risk down to the street level. While price is still the dominant factor in most home-buying decisions, these search capabilities empower buyers with the flexibility or the financial wherewithal to be more selective than ever. And while the notion of a \u201cperfect\u201d community may be a fantasy, research shows that people who move are increasingly drawn to places where they feel as if they belong, says Matt Motyl, a social psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago."]
["realestate", "\u201cOne factor that plays into that is, \u2018Do the people here look and talk like me?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Motyl said. This trend raises some thorny questions. The growing accessibility of highly detailed demographic data plays into the natural tendency of home buyers to look for \u201cpeople like us,\u201d which is as old as the subdivided hills. Indeed, some suburban communities were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries specifically with this in mind, some with discriminatory policies written into leases and deeds. But Bill Bishop, a Texas journalist and the author of \u201cThe Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart\u201d (Houghton Mifflin, 2008), argues that this tribalism is a major driver of the country\u2019s deepening political polarization. Over the last 30 years, he says, greater mobility, laws enforcing racial equity and prosperity have given Americans even more choice about where to live. Will Internet-enhanced abilities to scout out communities intensify that sorting effect? And what about the impact on segregation? The National Association of Realtors\u2019 code of ethics prohibits Realtors and associates involved in a sale from volunteering information regarding the racial, religious or ethnic composition of any neighborhood, lest they run afoul of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits the steering of clients to or away from neighborhoods out of bias.\u00a0 But many nonbrokerage real estate websites that act as referral generators for agents readily offer such information."]

He said he did not feel qualified to say one way or the other, but given that the housing act was passed in response to racial segregation and discrimination, Mr. Underwood said it was at least worth questioning the purpose of providing such information. The sites are simply making it easier for home buyers to access data that is already available, much of it through the Census Bureau, says Peter Goldey, the chief information officer and chief knowledge officer for Onboard Informatics, a provider of local content data and lifestyle search products for real estate sites. \u201cWe think the consumer has a right to information as long as the information is factual,\u201d he said. HUD may yet weigh in on the question. The department declined to make someone available for an interview, but in a prepared statement, Gustavo F. Velasquez, the assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, said: \u201cWe are aware of the issue and are reviewing it. It would be premature for us to comment while the review is underway.\u201d Home buyers moving away from familiar turf have traditionally consulted friends, family and co-workers for advice. \u201cTo date, really, the powerful force is where people like you tell you where you should go to live,\u201d said Maria Krysan, a sociologist who studies housing search processes and a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Having lots of neighborhood information at their fingertips offers home buyers some protection from pushy agents who don\u2019t necessarily have their best interests in mind, says Andrew Schiller, the founder and chief executive of Location Inc., in Worcester, Mass., which owns NeighborhoodScout.com. \u201cThe problem comes when real estate professionals have product to move in a location that has issues or is not attractive to people because the schools aren\u2019t good, the crime rate is high, or the appreciation rates aren\u2019t moving in the right direction,\u201d Mr. Schiller said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the potential conflicts with the real estate industry.\u201d He compares his service to a sort of Consumer Reports for communities.

And one of those is \u201cbeing free of fair housing rules,\u201d he wrote.

This is an acceptable practice under the N.A.R.\u2019s code of ethics, Mr. Underwood said. Redfin, for example, links to a third-party provider, Onboard Informatics, for demographics, although the Redfin link does not include information about race and religion. Bridget Frey, the company\u2019s vice president of Seattle engineering, said Redfin is more focused on developing proprietary features that give buyers an edge, such as the \u201cHot Homes\u201d alert of listings most likely to quickly go under contract. Mr. Goldey of Onboard maintains that real estate websites should be free to post all kinds of demographic data, regardless of whether they are selling directly to buyers, as long as they stick to the facts. The Fair Housing Act, he says, \u201cis only supposed to keep what are potentially nonfactual observations or perspectives by a single person like a real estate agent from influencing a person like a home buyer.\u201d Legal questions aside, the growing accessibility of so much demographic data has the potential to fuel the segregation that is already increasing along a number of lines \u2014 economically, racially, ideologically. Mr. Bishop, the author of \u201cThe Big Sort,\u201d argues that as other forms of community have gone away or weakened, Americans are increasingly reordering themselves around shared values and areas of interest. \u201cGiven a choice,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople choose to segregate themselves into these places where they can surround themselves with people like themselves.\u201d"]
["realestate", "This self-segregating boosts people\u2019s sense of well-being by satisfying the need to belong, says Mr. Motyl, who studies ideological migration.

The Nets, after all, had beaten the Heat in all four regular-season meetings. As opponents, the Heat players said, the Nets proved to be versatile shape-shifters. And perhaps most important, the Nets were steely and battle-worn, particularly this year with Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett \u2014 longtime rivals and postseason tormentors of LeBron James \u2014 on their immense payroll. By late Tuesday night, the Heat had taken those notions and obliterated them in a 107-86 blowout before a capacity crowd at American Airlines Arena. They took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series and dismissed, at least until Game 2 on Thursday, the idea that the Nets might exist in their stratosphere. Before this series, the previous 25 times that two teams met in a best-of-seven postseason series after one team had gone 4-0 or better against the other in the regular season, the winners from regular season went on to win that series.

With about four minutes remaining in the quarter, after a steal by Mario Chalmers, James drove the ball into the lane, directly at Andray Blatche, absorbed a blow to the body and still rattled in a shot from six feet out. As the Nets called timeout and the fans roared, James skipped down the court, puffing his chest and nodding his head in an exaggerated motion. \u201cAfter eight days off not playing a game, I feared the rhythm,\u201d James said. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t fear it anymore.\u201d"]

Afterward, the Nets rued the many mental lapses that left Heat players free on back-cuts to the basket. The Heat shot 56.8 percent from the floor and scored 52 points in the lane. The Nets were suffocated by the Heat\u2019s defense and seemed reluctant to drive to the rim. Shaun Livingston was the only starter to attempt a free throw \u2014 and the only one to play meaningful time in the fourth quarter. Joe Johnson and Deron Williams each scored a team-high 17 points. Pierce and Garnett were nonfactors, scoring a combined 8 points and going 3 for 10 from the field before spending most of the fourth quarter watching from the bench. Garnett did not have a point, the first time in 139 playoff games that he did not score. This was a playoff matchup particularly rich with interpersonal subtext and intrigue. It positioned the league\u2019s two-time defending champions against its most expensive team. And it brought one of the game\u2019s best players, James, face to face with the player who over the years has been perhaps his fiercest rival, Pierce. On Tuesday morning, Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra laughed off the notion that Pierce and Garnett were diminished players. \u201cWe don\u2019t get rope-a-doped into that conjecture,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThose two guys, they may be wearing black and silver, but there\u2019s green underneath it somewhere.

Then he got word that he was being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He made a quick trip to Los Angeles for a physical and returned immediately to China to finish his obligations. Word had traveled quickly. \u201cEverybody was wearing only yellow,\u201d Lin said Thursday at an introductory news conference with the Lakers. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, that was fast.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Lin is hoping for an equally rapid transformation after the Rockets sent him to the Lakers to clear cap space in an ultimately failed attempt to lure the free agent Chris Bosh away from the Miami Heat. Lin, in the final year of a contract that will pay him $15 million \u2014 about half of which will count against the salary cap \u2014 is hoping that after being replaced in Houston\u2019s starting lineup last season he can establish himself as something more than the crossover cultural sensation that hit New York two years ago. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to recreate Linsanity,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be that phenomenon that happened in New York. I think I just want to be myself, more than ever.\u201d And so Lin, dressed in a blue suit, did not shrink when Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak, wearing slacks and a polo shirt, chided him for being overdressed by Los Angeles\u2019s casual standards. He stood, smiled and relaxed."]
["sports/basketball", "Just what the Lakers have in mind for Lin is unclear. They have yet to hire a coach, though Byron Scott has been interviewed three times. They also have a remade roster built on short-term contracts. The Lakers picked up Carlos Boozer on an amnesty waiver claim, drafted Julius Randle and brought back Nick Young and four other free agents who were on the worst team in franchise history. With Kobe Bryant \u2014 soon to be 36 and coming off Achilles\u2019 tendon and knee surgeries \u2014 and the Lakers starting their third consecutive season with a new coach, expectations have been tempered. Given Los Angeles\u2019s sizable Chinese population, Lin is expected to remain a popular figure. A sign came recently when a 72-year-old retired Chinese-American schoolteacher, who happens to be an avid Lakers fan, went on Craigslist to offer Lin a spare room, according to The Daily Breeze, of Torrance. The Lakers are also gearing up for a substantial increase in media interest from China, where Bryant is quite likely the N.B.A.\u2019s best-known player. That sort of following recalled Lin\u2019s early days with the Knicks, when Lin, one of the few Asian-Americans to play in the N.B.A., became a national sensation after he was picked up off waivers from Houston, dropped into the moribund Knicks\u2019 lineup and transformed into a nearly unstoppable offensive force \u2014 all while sleeping on his brother\u2019s couch on the Lower East Side. The highlight was Lin\u2019s 38-point performance in a nationally televised victory over the Lakers at Madison Square Garden."]
["sports/basketball", "Asked if the trade prompted any memories of that game, Lin said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t until I got asked 500 questions about it in Asia. I didn\u2019t think of that at all when I first heard of it, but I\u2019ve replayed that game in my head a few times in the past couple weeks.\u201d Lin parlayed that brief period into a three-year, $25.1 million free-agent contract with the Rockets \u2014 and a photo shoot in GQ. Though Lin continued to improve his 3-point shooting \u2014 he shot a career-best 35.8 percent last season \u2014 and his ability to play without the ball, he was replaced as a starter by Patrick Beverley, a superior defender on a team with few good ones. Lin suffered another indignity earlier this summer when the Rockets, in a free-agent pitch to Carmelo Anthony, showed Anthony in a display in a No. 7 Rockets uniform, which at the time happened to belong to Lin. (He will wear No. 17 with the Lakers.) Lin said his roller coaster ride \u2014 from being a fringe player to a sudden star to one searching for his niche in the N.B.A. \u2014 had seasoned him. Yes, he would like to start \u2014 just like anyone. But what is important, he said, is making the most of his opportunities, in whatever form they arrive."]
["sports/basketball", "\u201cAfter my year in New York, I wanted to stay on that path; I wanted to be a starter, and that was something I really kind of cherished,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI really appreciated it because I was on the other end of being cut and getting waived, and maybe held on to it a little too tightly.\u201d He relishes the possibility of learning from Steve Nash, who is 40 and coming off two injury-plagued seasons with the Lakers. One of Lin\u2019s regrets about leaving New York was not getting the chance to play with Nash, who considered approving a trade to the Knicks two years ago, or Jason Kidd, two likely Hall of Fame point guards. Lin does not have many of those regrets. He is about to turn 26, an age when most players \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 have established an identity.

["theater", "For the Asking, a $480 Seat - The New York Times Saying they want to cut into the lucrative market dominated by ticket scalpers, the producers of ''The Producers'' are preparing to set aside at least 50 seats every performance and charge the unprecedented amount of $480 a ticket. The sum is nearly five times the current cost of $100 for the most expensive seats, itself a Broadway high. The plan is set to begin early next month with the sale of 50 premium orchestra and mezzanine seats at the St. James Theater, seats that have been almost impossible to attain since the show opened to rave reviews in April. The move marks the first time in Broadway history that producers will withhold, and aggressively mark up, some of the best seats for those willing to pay for assured access, a practice already employed in luxury suites for teams like the Knicks and the Yankees, as well as in boxes for events like the U.S. Open and in special seating at rock concerts. The producers said the decision was made after months of watching scalpers buy tickets for the show and then quickly resell them to hungry theatergoers at an enormous profit. ''What we're trying to do here is strike a blow at the heart of the scalping operation,'' said Rocco Landesman, one of the play's producers and the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the St. James. ''The scalpers and their profits serve no one but the scalpers. Those monies belong to the people who created the show, pure and simple.''"]
["theater", "The plan was outlined in a memo provided to The New York Times by the producers of the show in response to a reporter's query. Originally, it was to have been announced  last month but was delayed because of the attacks upon the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Whatever the price, the demand for ''Producer'' tickets are still white hot. Even during the drop-off that struck Broadway in the weeks after the attacks, customers lined up on West 44th Street to see Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in Mel Brooks's musical comedy about two producers who scheme to gain a windfall by intentionally backing a flop, a musical about Hitler. Scalpers are regularly getting hundreds of dollars above face value for ''Producers'' tickets outside the St. James, with less covert, but no less profitable, sales going through hotel concierge desks and through ticket brokers. The online market, in particular, is booming. Sites like www.the-producers-tickets.net advertised yesterday four orchestra seats for Tuesday night at $742.50 each, or $642.50 above face value. While such markups are illegal in New York, many such sites are based in other states. ''We're trying to get a part of that  market,'' said Tom Viertel, another of the musical's producers. The outline of the plan notes that the target customer base for the $480 ticket is ''large corporations, first-class tourists and individuals seeking prime locations, frequently on short notice,'' a group that previously had ''been forced to obtain these seats through brokers unaffiliated with the show.''"]
["theater", "The $480 ticket easily eclipses the current top ticket price on Broadway -- $100 -- a figure also set by ''The Producers,'' and subsequently matched by this season's musical hit, ''Mamma Mia,'' a musical built around songs of the Swedish pop group ABBA. The new income is likely to also increase the show's weekly potential take to more than $1.2 million a week, which would be another Broadway high. Industry insiders debated yesterday about how successful the ''Producers'' plan might be, and wondered whether, like the $100 ticket, other shows might soon imitate it. ''The problem they are going to face is the public relations aspect,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, the largest Broadway theater owner. ''It's all right for Madison Square Garden or the World Series to charge thousands of dollars, but there seems to be a sort of different idea when it comes to tickets for theater.'' Officials for two other blockbuster hits, ''The Lion King,'' the Disney spectacular, and ''Mamma Mia,'' said there were no immediate plans to join the ''Producers'' premium-ticket plans. That said, one theater official suggested that it might be just a matter of time. ''Other people will follow, absolutely,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''It's too big a market not to.'' Especially in the wake of Sept. 11 attacks and the reeling economy, ''Producers'' officials were loath to appear to be gouging the public or getting greedy with a hit. Mindful of the timing, the producers of ''The Producers'' pledged to donate $150 from every $480 ticket to the Twin Towers Fund for several months."]
["theater", "The producers justified the increase by saying that it was a way of ensuring that the creators of the play, not the scalpers, won a proper share of the royalties. And, they said, it would be a means for high-paying customers to obtain good seats, not the obscured-view seats and nose-bleed balcony perches often peddled by people on the streets.. ''The scalper has no risk and no responsibility,'' said Mr. Viertel.  ''Scalpers don't offer refunds if our stars aren't in the show. We do.'' Considering the show's runaway success, it's unlikely the higher prices will put any scalpers out of business. In fact, the producers' move gives some credence to the scalpers' exorbitant prices. ''I'm sure that any number of people are already paying grossly excessive prices,'' said Mr. Schoenfeld, the Shubert chairman. Still, the move marks just the latest  price leap for Broadway, an industry that has struggled to find a young audience willing to pay high prices when cheaper fare is available at the multiplex. It may also be difficult for many in the theater industry to feel too much sympathy for their battles with scalpers. ''The Producers,'' written by Mr. Brooks and Thomas Meehan with songs by Mr. Brooks, is virtually sold out through the end of next year. The show has won 12 Tonys -- a record -- including best musical and best actor in a musical, awarded to Mr. Lane,  playing Bialystock. The show nets a weekly profit of about $550,000, and has already recouped about 75 percent of its $10.5 million capitalization, just six months into what is expected to be a very long run."]
["theater", "Broadway's few previous attempts to offer high-priced amenities for higher-paying customers have met with mixed success. In 1997, for example, the producers of ''Ragtime'' offered good seats, Champagne, coat check and private lounges for $125 a ticket. While the promotion was popular, the show closed at a $10 million loss. In the ''Producers'' case, the 50 new seats -- in the 11th and 12th rows of the orchestra and the first three rows of the mezzanine -- became available after a promotion the producers had with the American Express company expired on Oct. 1. The $480 ticket will actually have a $400 face value -- an $80 commission will be charged by a new company, Broadway Inner Circle, which handles the sales and marketing of premium seats. A new New York State law passed in June allows scalpers to earn up to 20 percent of the ticket's face value in a resale, hence the $80 surcharge on a $400 ticket. But of course the producers of a show can charge whatever they believe the traffic will bear. Unlike luxury boxes at sporting event, patrons of the Inner Circle seats will have few amenities beyond not having to wait in line. The seats are not separated from other audience members paying $100. Nor will monstrous buffets of food, open bars or video replays be likely. Despite that, the producers said they were confident that there was a sizable market of people who would  pay almost any price to see their show."]

Those frustrations spilled over when Mr. Obama convened his top aides in the Cabinet room after canceling his schedule on Wednesday. Medical officials were providing information that later turned out to be wrong. Guidance to local health teams was not adequate. It was unclear which Ebola patients belonged in which threat categories. \u201cIt\u2019s not tight,\u201d a visibly angry Mr. Obama said of the response, according to people briefed on the meeting.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and its arrival in the United States, is the latest in a cascade of crises that have stretched Mr. Obama\u2019s national security staff thin. As the White House scrambled to stop the spread of Ebola beyond a handful of cases, officials were also grappling with an escalating military campaign against the Islamic State, the specter of a new Cold War with Russia over Ukraine, and the virtual disintegration of Yemen, which has been a seedbed for Al Qaeda. Senior officials said they pushed Mr. Obama to name an Ebola coordinator as a way of easing pressure on the staff at the National Security Council."]

On Thursday night, in televised remarks, Mr. Obama sought to reassure the public about the dangers from Ebola. But the sense of crisis that emanated from the White House was in sharp contrast to Sept. 30, when Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who had traveled to Dallas, tested positive for Ebola. Mr. Obama received a telephone briefing from Dr. Thomas R.

On Oct. 1, Mr. Obama met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and later had dinner with friends at the RPM Steakhouse in Chicago, where he had traveled for fund-raisers and to deliver an economic speech. By early October, as questions about the Dallas hospital\u2019s treatment of Mr. Duncan mounted, federal officials began reassessing their response, even as they continued to express confidence. C.D.C. officials publicly dismissed the effectiveness of screening for Ebola at airports in the United States.

The business-as-usual sentiment at the White House changed abruptly, officials said, when it got word early Wednesday that a second nurse in Dallas contracted the disease. The fact that she had traveled on a Frontier Airlines flight despite having a fever added to the concern, officials said. \u201cThis Frontier thing took it out of the abstract thing and to this level where people could identify with and made them scared,\u201d a senior official said.

Ms. Wrong said Mr. Nkurunziza\u2019s aspirations of longevity were part of a power pattern in much of Africa: Leaders of countries torn by civil war or other conflicts seek to perpetuate their rule, abetted by weak democratic institutions and an unwillingness to groom successors or yield to rivals. \u201cThey stay in power because the economy is in the hands of a tiny elite of cronies surrounding the president, and if they leave, they or their families can risk being prosecuted,\u201d she said. Burundi\u2019s Constitution stipulates that the president can hold office only for two five-year terms. Mr. Nkurunziza has been in office since 2005, but he contends that his first term should not count toward the limit because he was not directly elected when he first became president."]
["world/africa", "A court ruled that Mr. Nkurunziza could run again because he was appointed by Parliament, but his opponents have questioned the legitimacy of that decision.

During the civil war, Hutu rebel groups fought against the army, which was under the control of the Tutsis, fostering anger and resentment among the Hutu majority. Mr. Nkurunziza had led a rebel Hutu group."]

He removed a wide-eyed doe and a cheerful-looking crocodile from the m\u00e9lange \u2014 once models of brooches for some of the most renowned jewelry houses of the 20th century \u2014 and added them to the serried menagerie appearing before him. He is the third-generation chief executive of Mathon Paris \u2014 a French, family-owned jewelry atelier that has worked as a silent partner to some of the most famous names on the Place Vend\u00f4me since its creation in 1931. The atelier was founded by Camille Bournadet, the uncle of Roger Mathon, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mathon\u2019s father, who bought it in 1972. It has since passed on to his sons, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Pascal, and his granddaughter Aude. The family\u2019s labyrinthine workshop can still be found today through a discreet door on the fourth floor of a typically Hausmannian building on the Rue de Richelieu in the First Arrondissement. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know that we are here, you can never guess,\u201d said Aude Mathon. The company is little known to retail customers. It does 80 percent of its business supplying well-known companies with handworked pieces. The rest of its business goes to its own collections."]
["style/international", "Mathon\u2019s decision to sell a selection of pieces under its own name came after a shakeup in French luxury jewelry in the 1990s, when the big houses turned almost exclusively to their own studios for designs. Reluctant to lose their creative freedom and take on a purely manufacturing role, Mathon\u2019s owners chose to start selling a selection of pieces under their own name. Mathon is one of the last ateliers of its kind. A jewelry company in Paris today that designs, manufactures and finishes its own pieces entirely under one roof is \u201creally rare,\u201d said Charlotte-Amalie Daehn, editor of the French jewelry magazine Dreams. \u201cThis is the old way of doing it.\u201d Fashioned by Mathon\u2019s team of 20 casters, polishers, jewelers and setters, the company\u2019s collections include such themes as cityscapes and literary subjects like the Arabian Nights. In keeping with the legacy of Roger Mathon, the company\u2019s prevailing motif is drawn from nature. Roger Mathon was a nocturnal and somewhat reclusive artist who once painted giant movie posters for theaters in the Opera district in Paris. His enduring influence was his garden in the G\u00e2tinais region of east-central France. By the river at the garden\u2019s edge, he found his principal muse, the dragonfly. The ephemeral creature is iconic to the house and is re-imagined each year by Mathon\u2019s head designer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Man\u00e9. Mr. Man\u00e9\u2019s designs range from rings that capture their translucent wings in indigo, turquoise and azure blue enamel to more classic diamond pendants in which the libellule flies alone or settles on pearls."]

But Mr. Man\u00e9 mixes his pieces with subtler and more luminous gems, such as opals and moonstones. \u201cA moonstone is like a small cosmos,\u201d he said in a recent interview at the workshop. He pointed to a water-lily pendant of white gold and pink tourmaline. Perched on its diamond-encrusted leaf, a miniature cabochon of moonstone recalls a tiny drop of water. This attention to detail, and the focus on nature, have appealed to clients in the Middle East and Asia, Ms. Mathon said. The dragonfly resonates particularly well in Japan: The country\u2019s historical name is Akitsushima, which means island of dragonflies. \u201cThey like the spirit of our collection,\u201d Ms. Mathon said. \u201cYou can feel that it\u2019s not mechanical, it\u2019s made by hand. There is a taste, there is a sensibility, there is a softness. All these values and symbols are bridges between Mathon Paris\u2019s taste and Japanese symbolism.\u201d Combining age-old techniques with new technology, the atelier is cluttered with an intriguing mix of high-technology instruments and apparatus that dates back to its early days. In an attempt to safeguard traditional jewelry-making methods and to protect made-in-France craftsmanship, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mathon played a leading role in the creation of a Joaillerie de France label in 2006.

It appears that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s fall is inevitable, but the question is how long it will take and how much suffering and bloodshed will occur before it happens. There is a looming second battle in Syria, as the opposition is divided along sectarian lines and between moderates and extremists. Simply being against Mr. Assad is no longer enough. In both practical and moral terms, no one\u2019s interests will be served by a chaotic collapse of the Syrian state, the empowerment of violent extremist groups with ties to Al Qaeda and the sectarian reprisals that could follow Mr. Assad\u2019s fall. America must therefore prepare to make new investments and commitments to avoid an even deeper catastrophe. American leadership, including providing arms and training to moderate rebels, are likely to be the only things that can tip the balance, help end the bloodshed and halt brewing threats to us and our allies. Yet the Obama administration has been indecisive, neither fully \u201cin\u201d nor \u201cout,\u201d as radicals and militants are rapidly becoming a more influential force inside Syria. Furthermore, if allegations of Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons \u2014 a \u201cred line\u201d that Mr. Obama has said Syria must not cross \u2014 prove true, it will force the White House and Congress to decide about expanding our involvement there."]
["opinion", "President Obama and his advisers face difficult decisions about Syria. He should work closely with Congress in devising his strategy and not deploy any military forces without Congressional consent. Like the president, I am reluctant to commit the United States as an active participant in a complex and distant war and do not support the deployment of American forces to topple Mr. Assad. But the time for \u201cleading from behind\u201d is over. First, the United States must act to affect the balance of power on the ground, shifting momentum away from radical Islamist groups toward more moderate elements that we hope can lead Syria after Mr. Assad\u2019s fall. Unfortunately, the moderate elements we must support are not the most formidable or the most cohesive of the forces fighting in Syria. We must use American resources and ingenuity to help change that \u2014 beyond the \u201cnonlethal assistance\u201d we currently provide. This will require weapons and training for rebel units vetted by the United States as well as assistance to improve leadership skills, and cohesiveness in both military and civilian institutions. We should not be engaged in nation building, but we can certainly support Syrians committed to rebuilding their country. But sending arms alone will not solve the problem. After all, small arms are already flowing to combatants from other sources in the region at an alarming rate. By more fully engaging vetted units and training them to respect the law of armed conflict, protect critical infrastructure and secure dangerous weapons sites, America can make a down payment on Syria\u2019s future by building relationships with future partners."]
["opinion", "In addition, the United States must take the lead in building an international consensus on what the next government of Syria will look like. We can be under no illusions: this will be very difficult and will require that we secure significant changes in policy from Russia and other countries in the region. Establishing common cause between moderate Sunni groups and Alawites \u2014 parties that are currently at war with one another \u2014 against radical Sunni groups and Iranian proxies will be central to building Syria\u2019s next government. The Alawites are largely clinging to Mr. Assad\u2019s regime for fear that a Sunni victory will lead to sectarian violence against them and that it may be part of the larger, increasingly bitter Sunni-Shia divide throughout the region. When it comes to Russia, America must display a deeper understanding of Russia\u2019s regional interests and take advantage of our shared concerns about Islamic extremism. Russian leaders believe that Syria is becoming a safe haven for extremists, and we should take that concern seriously while at the same time insisting on sending aid to moderate groups. This could be the basis for a new understanding with Moscow and a shared approach toward Syria. Only Russia can convince Mr. Assad that he must step aside, which is an essential first step toward a negotiated solution, and only the United States is in a position to persuade the Friends of Syria \u2014 a group of 11 nations \u2014 to isolate extremists and bring the core of the opposition to the negotiating table."]
["opinion", "The United States must also be more aggressive in stopping Iranian support for Mr. Assad. Likewise, public and private sources of support for anti-Assad extremists in Syria should be publicized and targeted with sanctions. Other countries opposed to Mr. Assad, including American allies, must also be much more selective about who they arm and support in the war in Syria. They must recognize that it is in their interests, as well as America\u2019s, to build an Alawite-Sunni alliance of the center to oppose both Mr. Assad\u2019s army and Sunni extremists with ties to Al Qaeda. Changing the dynamics of the conflict in the short term will help preserve and rebuild a stable Syria over the long term. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s recent trip to Istanbul reflects this view and is a welcome step. But ending the violence in Syria will require the United States to play an even greater role, and it will force both us and our partners to make difficult decisions. The consequences of our continued collective failure are unthinkable, and grow more serious every day."]
["health", "As Home Births Grow in U.S., a New Study Examines the Risks - The New York Times With a growing number of American women choosing to give birth at home or in birthing centers, debate is intensifying over an important question: How safe is it to have a baby outside a hospital? A study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine provides some of the clearest information on the subject to date. The study analyzed nearly 80,000 pregnancies in Oregon, and found that when women had planned out-of-hospital deliveries, the probability of the baby dying during the birth process or in the first month after \u2014 though slight \u2014 was 2.4 times as likely as women who had planned hospital deliveries. Out-of-hospital births also carried greater risk of neonatal seizures, and increased the chances that newborn babies would need ventilators or mothers would need blood transfusions. On the other hand, out-of-hospital births were far less likely to involve cesarean sections \u2014 5.3 percent compared with 24.7 percent in a hospital. They also involved fewer interventions to augment labor, and mothers had fewer lacerations. In the often polarized debate over home birth, the study has been embraced by advocates on all sides. Mary Lawlor, the executive director of the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives, who has criticized research that reached similar conclusions, called the new study \u201cvery well done\u201d and said \u201cthe overall statistics are pretty darn good. But, of course, when the lives of babies are at stake, we need to do everything we can to constantly learn from the data.\u201d"]

In 2012, according to federal data, births at home and birth centers amounted to 1.28 percent of all American births, up from 0.79 percent in 2004. That growth has drawn attention to issues of safety, midwife training and licensing, coordination between midwives and doctors, and arrangements for transferring women to hospitals if problems arise. The study was strengthened by key information recently added to Oregon birth certificates: where women planned to give birth, not just where they ended up delivering. That disclosure allowed researchers to separate out births that started at home or birthing centers but had to be transferred to hospitals. The study team, based at Oregon Health and Science University and including two obstetricians, a nurse, an epidemiologist and a certified nurse midwife, also adjusted for women\u2019s race, age, and pregnancy risks like diabetes or hypertension, so those factors could be ruled out as explanations for delivery problems."]

Of those, 75,923 women delivered in a hospital as planned; 3,203 delivered outside a hospital as planned, including almost 2,000 at home; and 601 women planned out-of-hospital births but were transferred to hospitals.

Forty inmates work eight hours a day, five days a week, making the balls. Another 40 prisoners work from their cells stitching together the outer covering of balls in a different manufacturing process. The factory opened in 2011 as part of a broader effort across Brazil to raise inmates\u2019 morale, prepare them for life after prison and reduce severe prison overcrowding. Other programs allow federal prisoners to whittle days from their sentences by participating in literacy programs, reading classic literature and writing book reports.

Instead, in a telephone conversation last week, Mr. Trump offered encouragement to Representative Marsha Blackburn, a conservative lawmaker and White House ally who has emerged as the favorite to win the Republican nomination for Mr. Corker\u2019s seat, according to three Republicans familiar with the call. Mr. Trump\u2019s West Wing advisers, their memories still fresh from Mr. Corker\u2019s jibes, are urging the president to resist entreaties from the senator and a handful of his colleagues who worry that the seat could slip from Republican hands in November. They are showing Mr. Trump polling that indicates how steep of a climb Mr. Corker would face in a primary campaign. If Mr. Trump does not change course, his silence could effectively doom any hopes Mr. Corker has for seeking a third term. The president is highly popular among Tennessee Republicans and may be the only person who could reverse Mr. Corker\u2019s standing with primary voters, who have soured on him since he portrayed Mr. Trump as a juvenile in need of day care, whose instability may push the country into World War III."]
["us/politics", "And without Mr. Trump\u2019s direct intervention, Ms. Blackburn is highly unlikely to bow to Mr. Corker. \u201cMarsha Blackburn is not getting out of this race regardless of who gets in,\u201d said Ward Baker, the Nashville-area lawmaker\u2019s chief strategist. Further, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has rebuffed Mr. Corker by telling him that he must secure the president\u2019s support to re-enter the race, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation, a rare act of political deference that suggests he is uneasy about driving Ms. Blackburn out of the primary race. But Mr. Corker and some of his Senate allies are aggressively working to win over the White House, embarking on what one West Wing official described as a sudden charm offensive. The senator has avoided any criticism of Mr. Trump in recent weeks and on Monday met with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter. Mr. Trump\u2019s political advisers, getting wind of the meeting, scrambled to brief Ms. Trump and her own staff about Mr. Corker\u2019s renewed interest in running again and his desire for the president\u2019s support, according to a Republican official. An aide to Mr. Corker said Ms. Trump requested the meeting. More broadly, Mr. Corker\u2019s advisers say he and Mr. Trump have patched up their relationship and the senator is simply hearing out those who would like him to remain in the Senate, a decision he technically does not have to make until Tennessee\u2019s filing deadline in early April."]
["us/politics", "\u201cIn recent days, people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda,\u201d said Micah Johnson, Mr. Corker\u2019s spokeswoman. Mr. Corker is not the only Republican who could shake up a closely watched Senate race. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who had been heavily courted by Mr. Trump and other leading Republicans but decided against a bid, is now signaling that he may mount a bid after all against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota\u2019s freshman Democrat. If Mr. Cramer\u2019s potential change of heart is lifting Republicans\u2019 spirits, the party is now uneasy about the prospect of having one too many Republicans in Tennessee. Mr. Corker\u2019s hopes for a rapprochement with Mr. Trump illustrate the degree to which loyalty to the president is becoming a central litmus test in Republican politics. And that he might consider a reconciliation with a senator who only a few months ago portrayed him as an unruly toddler underscores that there are no permanent friends or enemies to Mr. Trump. But party officials overseeing the midterms have little appetite for a bloody primary campaign in Tennessee. Democrats have cleared their field for Phil Bredesen, a wealthy former two-term governor and mayor of Nashville whose prospects in an increasingly conservative state would markedly improve if he faced a Republican limping into a general election."]
["us/politics", "Further, in a season full of disappointments across the Senate Republican map, Ms. Blackburn has been a bright spot, raising $2 million in the final quarter of last year, contributing to other candidates and uniting most of the party\u2019s factions. \u201cShe is raising more money and doing more than any other candidate in country,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and adviser to Mr. McConnell. Ms. Blackburn, who was already facing former Representative Stephen Fincher in the primary, is signaling that if she is forced to take on Mr. Corker she will wield her gender as a political weapon. That would raise a delicate issue for a Senate Republican caucus that includes just five women in its ranks. \u201cAnyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can\u2019t win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Ms. Blackburn, adding, \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about these ego-driven, tired old men.\u201d That is an unmistakable reference to a bloc of establishment-aligned Tennessee Republicans who believe Ms. Blackburn\u2019s conservative politics and hard-charging style may turn off some voters and make her vulnerable against the centrist and low-key Mr. Bredesen. Tom Ingram, a Republican strategist and a longtime friend of Mr. Corker\u2019s, argued that Republicans could imperil the seat and their one-seat majority if they do not rally around an incumbent who has already won the state twice. \u201cIt\u2019s a dicey race with an unproven statewide candidate against Phil Bredesen,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cIf Corker is the nominee, it\u2019s not in play.\u201d"]
["us/politics", "Fueling the anxieties of some Tennessee Republicans is the openness some in the party\u2019s donor wing have toward backing Mr. Bredesen. Concerns about such defections cropped up again this week when an invitation to a $5,400-per-couple Bredesen fund-raiser hosted by the widow of the former Nashville Republican powerhouse Ted Welch began circulating among Republicans. Such talk induces eye-rolling among a younger generation of Republicans in Tennessee. \u201cEvery Republican in Tennessee outside the walls of the Belle Meade Country Club believes Marsha is a heavy favorite against anybody who might get in that primary,\u201d said Brad Todd, a Republican consultant raised in the state who is not aligned in the Senate race."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR; Bush Campaign Turns Attention To Middle Class - The New York Times Gov. George W. Bush said today that he was determined to convince middle-income voters that they would fare better under his proposals than under Vice President Al Gore's, and he vowed to spend the coming days making that case as emphatically as possible. ''One of the big differences is that I want people controlling their lives,'' Mr. Bush said in a telephone interview that hewed to a theme he is working more and more aggressively: that Mr. Gore is bent on inflexible, federally mandated solutions. Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, sought to draw attention to a new campaign document, ''Blueprint for the Middle Class,'' which his aides released today. Essentially a 16-page, oversize pamphlet, it will be handed out at campaign events this week, and it distills his proposals for voters that Mr. Gore, with his constant references to ''working families,'' has courted both assiduously and successfully. Mr. Bush said the document was intended to put his agenda ''in a form where everybody can understand and people can see in specific what I have to offer.'' But the document and today's interview had additional, more specific purposes, advisers to Mr. Bush said. Tagged by Mr. Gore as a candidate on the side of big corporations and wealthy Americans, Mr. Bush was asserting that his policies would benefit all voters more than Mr. Gore's proposals would."]
["us", "Advisers said the phrase ''middle class'' in the document's title signaled that goal. The language also reflected opinion polls that showed some of Mr. Gore's most significant gains in the past month had been with voters in households earning  $50,000 to $75,000 a year. After the Democratic convention, at which Mr. Gore pointedly cast the race as a contest between ''the people,'' whom he pledged to champion, and ''the powerful,'' whom he said Mr. Bush represented, Mr. Bush's advisers made several adjustments. A week and a half ago, they rolled out a new slogan, ''real plans for real people,'' a phrase that appeared in large print on the cover of the ''Blueprint for the Middle Class.'' Today, Mr. Bush sought to draw attention to this new emphasis in interviews with a few reporters. The interviews were initiated by the campaign, the first time it had had Mr. Bush contact reporters to talk about his coming days of campaigning. Republican strategists said Mr. Bush was clearly trying to project a take-charge image and wrest control of the debate. ''One of the ways you regain momentum,'' said a Republican strategist who occasionally advises the campaign, ''is to make clear that you're trying to regain momentum.'' Along those lines, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, held a conference call with reporters to spell out the scope of the next six days. Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush would travel 6,076 miles from Monday to Saturday, visiting 12 cities in nine states that represented 160 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win."]
["us", "The Gore campaign responded to the document by accusing Mr. Bush of misleading voters with selective information. In what Mr. Gore's aides titled ''A Tale of the Tape,'' they noted that Mr. Bush's document was 2,644 words and had six pictures, while Mr. Gore's ''Prosperity for America's Families,'' an economic plan he unveiled earlier this month, had 69,042 words and no pictures. But Mr. Bush's aides said the document compressed information from a previously released, 457-page paperback book of speeches and policy prescriptions. The release of the document,  which did not include any new proposals, followed a speech on Saturday in which Mr. Bush attacked Mr. Gore's proposals in sharper language than ever before. Both developments underscored a shift in the Bush campaign, which is now focusing more intensely on the differences in the candidate's plans on Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts and education. ''I'm going to make this a contest on policy,'' Mr. Bush said. He said the race had reached a point where people were paying closer attention and needed to be reminded of where he stood, especially in comparison to Mr. Gore. ''One of the things about a campaign I've learned is timing is important,'' Mr. Bush said. ''When I give one speech, it doesn't necessarily soak in, so I'm going to continue to talk about what I intend to do and where we differ.''"]
["us", "Other comments he made suggested that the campaign had been prepared in the last seven weeks to try an array of approaches. He did not rule out making further attacks on Mr. Gore's ethics or character like the one in a television commercial several weeks ago that portrayed Mr. Gore as dishonest and politically inconsistent. Mr. Bush said he and his campaign would ''have to make those calls'' as the race proceeded. Asked whether his pledge to ''change the tone'' of politics would hurt his ability to raise questions about Mr. Gore's character, he said there was a difference between what a candidate might need to do in a campaign and how a candidate intends to govern. And he said he would govern in a more bipartisan, less acrimonious spirit than President Clinton and Mr. Gore had. That was another argument for his candidacy that he said he would be stressing. Mr. Bush said he wanted ''to remind people that I will be a different type of leader, something that hasn't been the case in the last eight years, something that will not be the case if the vice president becomes president.'' Advisers said today that the document was intended to appeal to voters in households that make $30,000 to $60,000 a year. According to a New York Times/CBS News Poll released last week, Mr. Bush still led Mr. Gore among voters in households in the $30,000 to $50,000 range, but now trailed among voters in households in the $50,000 to $75,000 range."]
["us", "One Bush adviser said today that middle-income voters in both groups cared deeply about whether their problems and aspirations were understood by candidates, and the adviser noted that Mr. Gore came out better in this regard. The adviser said Mr. Bush also needed to reverse the loss of support among women. ''I think what will help tremendously is if they hear him talking about their concerns,'' the adviser said, adding that what women and middle-income voters want ''more than anything is somebody who has empathy and understanding of where they are in their lives.'' Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, described these voters as ''very practical.'' ''They want to know: what are you going to do for them, and how does it differ from the other guy,'' Mr. Rove said. That approach will be reflected in events this week, which will trace life, from birth to old age, and talk about how Mr. Bush's proposals take into account people at each stage. On Monday Mr. Bush will visit a maternity ward in Little Rock, Ark., to talk about his proposal to double the per-child tax credit to $1,000 from $500. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush will visit an elementary school in Chicago to talk about school safety. Mr. Bush said he was confident about his approach and about the race, which he said was ''neck and neck.'' ''I'm running against an incumbent,'' he said. ''The fact that this race is close I find very heartening.''"]

Bambang Soelistyo, head of the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency, said that the plane was probably \u201cat the bottom of the sea\u201d and that Indonesia did not have the necessary equipment to search properly for it underwater.

The biggest name in the sport, the trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who had won the previous four Triple Crown races with three horses \u2014 some on Lasix and some not \u2014 hailed it as the beginning of uniform medication rules. The breeder Seth Hancock, of the prestigious Claiborne Farm in Kentucky, spoke for many when he said New York had finally leveled the playing field. Now, as yet another quest for racing\u2019s elusive Triple Crown culminates, Lasix, widely regarded as a masking agent for drug abuse, is racing\u2019s last big unresolved medication issue and the center of an internal struggle pitting owners and breeders against trainers and veterinarians. California Chrome\u2019s Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes victories have been sandwiched between blasts of bad publicity. Less than a month before the Derby, an undercover investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals focused harshly on the stable of Steve Asmussen, one of the sport\u2019s most successful trainers. The group filed charges of neglect, mistreatment and drugging of animals with the Kentucky and New York racing authorities."]
["sports", "Last month, the HBO program \u201cReal Sports\u201d essentially repeated a New York Times account of the PETA allegations, with graphic video footage of horses breaking down.

A \u201c60 Minutes Sports\u201d look at the racing industry\u2019s turmoil is scheduled to be presented Wednesday on Showtime, three days before the Belmont Stakes. After watching the \u201cReal Sports\u201d presentation, the prominent owner and breeder Bill Casner, a founder of WinStar Farm in Kentucky, wrote a letter to the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, which he once headed, acknowledging that \u201cthe reality of the broadcast is that all of it is true\u201d and that the industry had created those conditions with a \u201cplethora of legal medications with little regulation or oversight.\u201d The most volatile and disheartening disclosure of the PETA investigation and the subsequent follow-up reporting was the routine feeding of Thyro-L to horses by well-known trainers. Thyro-L is a synthetic hormone in powdered form that is usually prescribed to overweight mares whose hypothyroidism keeps them from becoming pregnant. Apparently, after some state regulators began to crack down on the abuse of the bronchodilator clenbuterol, some trainers turned to Thyro-L, which is now being blamed for a series of fatal heart attacks in young horses. There were many heart failures in the barns of the most accomplished and admired trainers in the game, including Asmussen, Bob Baffert and Todd Pletcher."]
["sports", "Under the duress of questioning by \u201cReal Sports\u201d about an equine heart attack victim in his barn, Asmussen described Thyro-L as a therapeutic medication and the pepped-up heart rate as a side effect. Over months of daily use, Casner said, it would \u201ccause the thyroid to atrophy with the eventual crash of the horse.\u201d Thyro-L and clenbuterol have long lists of side effects, which is why they are banned in every racing jurisdiction other than North America. There is little medical research specific to racehorses on either drug, an oddity that might be explained by the fact that administering Lasix to 95 percent of all thoroughbreds, although only 2 percent to 6 percent bleed excessively, is an estimated $100 million revenue stream from owners to veterinarians and drug companies, which most equine researchers depend on to finance their studies. Studies show that furosemide, the generic name of Lasix, causes dangerous electrolyte imbalances, particularly reduced levels of potassium and calcium, and lowers the count of white blood cells because of bone marrow suppression. When given with corticosteroids, a common practice, the drug damages the joints that fail in training breakdowns. It is hardly coincidental that today\u2019s horses seldom last long enough to even contest the Triple Crown. The supertrainers start out with dozens of 2-year-olds, most of them expensive sale toppers, but end up with only a few that remain healthy enough for the Kentucky Derby. Of the 11 horses expected to compete in the Belmont, only two come from the usual Triple Crown barns. They are trained by Pletcher."]
["sports", "In the 1950s, American horses averaged 45 career starts. For the foal crop of 2009, the average is 12.4. Those statistics have pushed New York and a group of other Mid-Atlantic states, including Maryland, to adopt tougher uniform drug rules. This year\u2019s Belmont will permit Lasix, but under the same tougher medication rules as the Preakness; most of the changes are meant to keep therapeutic drugs that thwart pain and enhance performance from being administered close enough to race time to be effective. Previous Triple Crown races in the modern era were contested under three sets of rules. Kentucky was among the first states to legalize Lasix, and for years, Maryland allowed it only for \u201cconfirmed bleeders,\u201d depriving Kentucky Derby winners of the advantage they had in Louisville. Racing\u2019s drug problems remain a long way from resolution. The New York and Kentucky racing authorities postponed action on the PETA charges against Asmussen until after the Belmont. It could easily turn out that all that drug abuse of racehorses is legal, as Asmussen contends and Casner laments. That in itself could serve as a clarion call for a federal law."]
["science", "The Toppled Chimney Mystery: Is It the Fault's Fault? - The New York Times Against the musical backdrop of masons' hammers everywhere clink-clinking on brick, Dr. Derek Booth, a geologist at the University of Washington, is driving through West Seattle pointing out the curious excess of chimneys damaged here in last month's earthquake. Cruising past the modest bungalows and ranch homes, he points to a chimney with a stair-step crack down its bricks, another cockeyed from twisting and many others beheaded at the roofline. Geologists have, in fact, been fascinated by the tumbling chimneys of West Seattle since they first fell like rain in the 1965 earthquake. Scientists asked, Did this working-class enclave shake more violently than everywhere else? Did contractors erect particularly shoddy chimneys or is there some other as yet unfathomed explanation? Now a new survey of 50,000 to 60,000 chimneys in the Puget Sound area may, at last, have identified the true culprit: the infamous Seattle fault zone. Scientists note that this complex of faults, running east-west beneath the city and beyond, did not move during the recent Nisqually earthquake. Instead, they say, the fault zone appears to have focused shaking from the quake, creating a zone of intensified destruction above itself -- through West Seattle and west to Bremerton and east to Beacon Hill. ''It's a surprise,'' said Dr. Booth, adding that while the fault zone remains by far the leading contender, researchers are continuing to test for other possible explanations for the pattern of damage. ''Nobody expected to see any association with the Seattle fault zone.''"]
["science", "With the survey of chimneys completed just this week, the team of 12 researchers headed up by Dr. Booth and Dr. Ray Wells, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, will present their findings at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America next month in San Francisco. Researchers said the new work would be of particular interest as the latest evidence indicating that faults can focus shaking to produce concentrated damage in unexpected locations, sometimes far from where the quake originated. In addition, the line of damage mapped so neatly over the Seattle fault zone that researchers are now surveying chimneys in hope of mapping the Olympia fault, whose boundaries are poorly known. To measure shaking from temblors, researchers typically use carefully calibrated and highly sensitive seismometers. But such instruments are expensive and deployed in limited numbers, making their measurements precise but few and far between. ''The seismologists have a lot on us,'' said Dr. Booth of researchers using such high-tech devices. ''But we've got 60,000 chimneys. That's the one thing we've got on them.'' Chimneys are also among the first things to fail in a quake and are easily seen from the road, making them ideal, if informal, monitors of shaking. To take advantage of these brick-and-mortar seismometers, researchers from the University of Washington, the Geological Survey and Western Washington University drove through Seattle as well as areas outside the city. When they spotted damaged or downed chimneys, they tallied the victims, their injuries and recorded their locations."]
["science", "The researchers found some 1,500 damaged chimneys, mostly in a distinctive east-west band atop the Seattle fault zone. In West Seattle the damage was so localized that the worst of it could be seen in the blocks coming off Hanford Street, which runs east-west. Dr. Wells said the team looked for other explanations for the pattern like changes in the rock types or topology but found none. ''It seems to cut across different architectural styles,'' he said. ''They're just all brick chimneys.'' But the fault zone can't explain all the damage. The Madrona neighborhood and an area southeast of Green Lake -- both away from the fault zone -- also had concentrations of damage, but less severe. Researchers say they do not yet know why. For residents hoping to gauge future threats, learning the cause may be less important than the fact that the damage is so strikingly predictable. ''These chimneys are a pretty good way to figure out in future earthquakes what's going to shake the hardest and where the damage might be focused,'' said Dr. Tom Brocher, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey who was not involved in the research. ''It's telling us to pay attention to this area in the future.'' Dr. Booth said the hardest-hit blocks in West Seattle were the same in the Feb. 28 quake as they were in 1965's. Even the same parts of the same houses felt the same stresses."]
["science", "Karen Witheril said she moved into her home in West Seattle not long after the 1965 quake. ''We'd seen damage in the plaster,'' said Mrs. Witheril, pointing out the hairline fractures in the living room and hallway as masons dismantled her chimney outside. ''That's where the cracks were again this time.'' Scientists say it is still unclear how the Seattle fault zone might be focusing shaking. In the most simplistic sense, researchers expect to see the greatest damage nearest to where an earthquake originates. But in Kobe, Japan, and Northridge, Calif., researchers found zones of intense damage away from the origin of the quake suggesting that seismic waves were not simply heading up and away from the faults from which they came. Instead, according to Dr. Robert Graves, a seismologist at the engineering company URS Corporation, one theory suggests that seismic waves can bounce or have their path of movement bent like a ray of refracted light when they hit a structure like a fault. That could potentially result in redirected waves piling up in unexpected locations and causing increased shaking -- as in West Seattle. But whether such mechanisms are at work remains to be seen. ''Now we have a chance to test this model with the new earthquake,'' said Dr. Graves. But geologists are not the only people whose careers have been enriched by the ruined chimneys."]

["business/dealbook", "Deutsche Bank to Shrink Investment Banking Unit in Russia - The New York Times LONDON \u2014 Deutsche Bank said on Friday that it was scaling back its investment banking operations in Russia as the bank\u2019s new co-chief executive, John Cryan, looks to reshape its business. The move reflects the bank\u2019s own organizational challenges as well as the increasing difficulty for international companies of all sorts to do business in Russia in light of Western sanctions and the country\u2019s stumbling economy. Friday\u2019s announcement came a day after Deutsche Bank said that Joerg Bongartz, the longtime chairman of its Russian business and head of its Global Transaction Banking operation there, was moving to Frankfurt and would assume a broader responsibility for the lender\u2019s business in Central and Eastern Europe. Mr. Cryan, who replaced Anshu Jain as co-chief executive of the big German bank this summer, has said that Deutsche Bank must become more efficient, jettison underperforming businesses and simplify its organization structure. Its unwieldy setup \u201cinhibits effective decision making, blurs accountability and embeds wasteful cost,\u201d Mr. Cryan said. On Friday, the bank said it would close its onshore corporate banking and securities operations in Russia. Instead, its Russian corporate finance and markets businesses will operate from the bank\u2019s other international hubs. Deutsche Bank said it would continue to offer prices in Russian securities to its clients, using third parties for execution, and would continue to provide banking services to core Russian clients."]
["business/dealbook", "The move, expected to affect about 200 full-time employees, is meant to be mostly completed by the end of the year. Following the pullback, Deutsche Bank will have about 1,100 employees in Russia. \u201cThis decision has been made in order to reduce complexity, costs, risks and capital consumption,\u201d the bank said in a news release. The scaling back of Deutsche Bank\u2019s business in Russia comes as Western economic sanctions, the decline in the value of the ruble, and the falling price of oil have weighed heavily on the Russian economy. President Vladimir V. Putin has responded to the Western measures with countersanctions. Deutsche Bank itself is facing regulatory scrutiny over a series of so-called mirror trades in Russia that may have breached laws against money laundering. In July, Deutsche Bank said that it was investigating the circumstances of equity trades entered by clients in Moscow and in London that appeared to offset one another and that the volume of the transactions under review was \u201csignificant.\u201d \u201cThe ongoing internal investigation includes a review as to whether violations of law, regulation or policy have occurred, as well as a review of Deutsche Bank\u2019s related internal controls,\u201d the bank said at the time. The pullback by Deutsche Bank in Russia is the first of what could be several major moves by Mr. Cryan, a former high-ranking executive of the Swiss bank UBS who was named co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank in June."]
["business/dealbook", "After the changes announced on Friday, the bank\u2019s Global Transaction Banking business, which has been in Russia for 134 years, will continue to operate in the country, providing trade finance, cash management and currency trading services. Its institutional cash business, however, will serve Russian clients from offices in other countries. Deutsche Bank said it would also continue to serve wealth management clients in Russia, but that it would consolidate the business\u2019s administration and booking outside the country. Of the employees remaining in Russia, about 200 will be primarily associated with its Global Transaction Business, and about 900 will be involved in its global technology operations. Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems are by no means limited to Russia. The bank has had poor profitability in recent years and has faced several scandals that have led to huge fines and hurt its reputation. In April, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties to the United States and British authorities to settle accusations of fixing benchmark interest rates. The fine was larger than that paid by other banks in the case, and many shareholders blamed Mr. Jain, who resigned in June, for bungling negotiations with investigators. Deutsche Bank has set aside 3.8 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion, in additional provisions to cover costs from lawsuits and official investigations into allegations of misconduct, primarily in the years before the financial crisis began in 2008."]

This week\u2019s action will feature eight teams from tiny countries that are quite unlikely to hang around the competition for very long. The Lincoln Red Imps would seem to be an imposing contender, having won an astonishing 13 consecutive titles in their home country. Unfortunately for them, that country is Gibraltar, UEFA\u2019s newest and lowest-ranked member. In their Champions League debut last year, the Red Imps lost to a team from the Faroe Islands, population 50,000. This year, their opponent is Santa Coloma (or \u201choly dove\u201d) of Andorra, population 80,000. The Faroe Islands, a protectorate of Denmark in the North Atlantic, are represented this year by B36 Torshavn. Known colloquially as the White Tigers, the club has played 34 European games in its history and won two. B36 will face a team from Wales with an unusual name history. Initially called Llansantffraid F.C., it took the name Total Network Solutions, or T.N.S., in 1997 after a computer company, its chief sponsor.

["arts/design", "Julian Stanczak, Abstract Painter, Dies at 88 - The New York Times Julian Stanczak, a Polish-born American abstract painter who rose to fame as a leading figure of the popular Op Art movement but slipped into obscurity when its reputation flagged, died on March 25 at his home in Seven Hills, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. He was 88. His death was confirmed by his New York gallery, Mitchell-Innes & Nash. His family said that he had died after a short illness. Mr. Stanczak was a firmly optimistic artist, despite injuries in a Soviet labor camp during World War II that rendered his dominant right arm useless. He helped name the art movement to which he was linked in 1964 when his New York debut at the Martha Jackson Gallery was titled \u201cJulian Stanczak: Optical Paintings.\u201d Reviewing that exhibition in Arts magazine, Donald Judd, then an emerging Minimalist sculptor, coined the phrase Op Art in a sardonic closing sentence, linking the upsurge in perceptual abstraction, as it was sometimes called, to the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s plans to survey the trend. Indeed, Op Art went supernova in 1965, with the Modern\u2019s exhibition \u201cThe Responsive Eye\u201d (even though the museum avoided the term). While critically derided, the exhibition set attendance records at the museum. It represented around 100 artists, from 15 countries and nearly three generations, working in assorted optical or geometric styles. Mr. Stanczak\u2019s art evinced a tremendous geometric inventiveness. He constantly elaborated on the possibilities of parallel stripes, both straight and undulant; squares, both checkerboard and concentric; and grids, usually amplified by contrasting saturated colors."]
["arts/design", "He once told an interviewer that his style was an attempt to forget about his war traumas. \u201cI did not want to be bombarded daily by the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked for anonymity of actions through nonreferential abstract art.\u201d But his work was far from anonymous. He produced some of the most emotionally gripping paintings associated with the Op trend. This was achieved partly by his delicately textured paint surfaces and partly by the soft light that often infiltrated his forms and patterns, the result of an infinitesimal adjustment of the shades of one or two colors. His main concern, in fact, was color, which he viewed subjectively. \u201cColor is abstract, universal,\u201d he once said, \u201cyet personal and private in experience. It primarily affects us emotionally, not logically, as do tangible things.\u201d Julian Stanczak was born on Nov. 5, 1928, on his grandfather\u2019s farm near the village of Borownica, Poland. His father worked in construction and built houses in addition to farming, and Julian loved to make things from wood, including furniture and toys. In 1940, during Russia\u2019s occupation of the eastern half of the country, Mr. Stanczak and his family were caught up in the first wave of mass deportations of Poles to Siberian labor camps. They ended up cutting timber in the Ural Mountains, where conditions were brutal. Mr. Stanczak survived pneumonia, encephalitis and near starvation, but overwork permanently incapacitated his right arm."]
["arts/design", "In 1942 the Soviet Union granted amnesty to imprisoned Polish citizens, and Mr. Stanczak and his family walked and hitchhiked 2,500 miles south to Tehran, where his father joined the Polish Army in exile. Saying he was 17 and not 14, Mr. Stanczak also joined \u2014 partly to eat, partly in the hope that the army\u2019s doctors might help his arm. When they made it worse, he deserted. Mr. Stanczak, his mother and his sister ended up spending six years in a Polish refugee camp in Uganda. There, Mr. Stanczak learned to write and paint left-handed. He was, he said, profoundly affected by the African light, the intensely colored sunsets and what he called \u201cthe immense visual energy\u201d of nature there \u2014 the plants, trees and animals, especially zebras. He also admired the geometric patterns of the textiles from which Ugandan women made their clothing. By 1948, when his family was reunited in London, Mr. Stanczak was making small, patterned abstractions in bright colors or in black and white. He studied art at the Borough Polytechnic Institute for two years and devoted himself to the city\u2019s art museums. In 1950 the family relocated to Cleveland, and in 1954 he earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Cleveland Institute of Art. He then studied for his master\u2019s at Yale with Conrad Marca-Relli and Josef Albers, who was well known for his color theories (and who was also the oldest artist in the \u201cResponsive Eye\u201d exhibition). Mr. Stanczak\u2019s roommate was Richard Anuszkiewicz, another graduate of the Cleveland Institute and, later, another prominent Op artist."]

He is survived by his wife, Barbara Stanczak, a sculptor; their daughter, Danusia M. Casteel; their son, Krzys; two grandchildren; and a great-grandson. Mr. Stanczak remained affiliated with the Martha Jackson Gallery until it closed in 1979, by which time Op Art had been largely superseded by Minimalism and other more austere kinds of geometric abstraction \u2014 at least within the confines of New York. He continued to exhibit frequently elsewhere, especially in galleries and museums across the Midwest; more than 90 museums in the United States and abroad ultimately acquired his work. But he did not have a solo show in New York until 2004, at the Stefan Stux Gallery, followed by another there in 2005.

In publicity materials, Nate Parker, the film\u2019s director, writer, producer and star, says audiences should leave theaters asking, \u201cWhen injustice knocks at our own front door, are we going to counter it with everything we have?\u201d The distributor of the historical drama, Fox Searchlight, has promoted it with provocative posters depicting Mr. Parker\u2019s character with his head in a noose made from an American flag and with trailers that feature Andra Day\u2019s stirring rhythm-and-blues song \u201cRise Up.\u201d But when \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d arrives in roughly 2,000 theaters on Friday, Fox Searchlight is hoping that a parallel and largely invisible marketing effort \u2014 one intended to contain and frame Mr. Parker\u2019s message \u2014 will ease the film into communities already on edge. As the nation struggles to deal with the issue of race after a number of episodes in which unarmed black men have been killed by the police, prompting protests in cities across the country, the studio wants \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d to inspire but not incite. Whether Fox Searchlight can have it both ways will depend on the effectiveness of a grass-roots campaign aimed at churches, schools and pockets of political influence."]
["business/media", "As it has publicly dealt with new attention on a rape case from 1999 involving Mr. Parker, the studio has quietly hosted an unusually expansive series of private screenings of the film for groups like the Congressional Black Caucus and the Conference of National Black Churches.

Studio operatives have also distributed guides to roughly 80,000 churches that contain suggestions for weaving the film and its themes into sermons. Classroom study materials were made available to more than 30,000 teachers. \u201cWe can\u2019t control how the film is ultimately read, what actions people may take, but one message has been that there are very viable and practical steps,\u201d said the Rev.

Rise up to build affordable housing. Rise up in a constructive way.\u201d In conjunction with the film, Fox Searchlight helped organize a voter enrollment effort in multiplex lobbies. Actors from \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d also recorded a video to raise voting awareness, which has run in participating theaters. \u201cThis fall, we will all have the opportunity to put our differences aside and celebrate the rights that unite us as Americans,\u201d says Colman Domingo, who plays a slave named Hark in the movie."]

He hopes the killings will be the first shots in a war for equality and justice, but whites slay him and his followers as retribution. The film is direct in its effort to connect America\u2019s racist past to the present. In one jarring scene that echoes contemporary accounts of police shootings, slave hunters stop Turner\u2019s innocent father on a road and try to kill him. Mr. Parker declined an interview request, but studio publicity materials quote him as explaining, \u201cIf you look at history \u2014 if you look at the history, say, of how Southern police departments developed out of slave patrols \u2014 then you can better analyze where we are now.\u201d Fox Searchlight, which also declined to comment, paid a hefty $17.5 million in January to acquire distribution rights to \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d which takes its title from the 1915 D. W. Griffith silent movie, which is considered a landmark for its innovative filmmaking technique but is derided as racist for its stereotypical depiction of blacks and its sympathetic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan. At the time, the studio was confident it could turn the well-reviewed movie into a hit."]
["business/media", "The subject matter of Mr. Parker\u2019s film is timely and relevant, dovetailing with the Black Lives Matter movement. Mr. Parker, who spent seven years struggling to get \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d made, had a compelling story to tell. And there was a shortage of prestige-minded films with diverse casts. The shutout of black actors by Academy Awards voters (for a second year in a row) and subsequent #OscarsSoWhite outcry made that clear. But the marketing plan grew complicated in a hurry. Police shootings of black men \u2014 many of them captured on video \u2014 continued to set off protests around the country. Then, in July, a demonstration in Dallas turned violent when a gunman killed five police officers. He set out to kill as many white officers as possible, Texas officials said. Fox Searchlight had conducted focus group research to see if \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d might be viewed as a call to aggression and concluded there was no risk. Even so, the studio leaned into its effort to position the film as a specific type of provocation \u2014 a peaceful one. \u201cPart of our work has been to distill that \u2018rise up\u2019 message down,\u201d said Mr. Mitchell, who is the pastor of Salem Baptist Church in Jenkintown, Pa., and a founder of Wit PR, a firm that specializes in outreach to spiritually minded moviegoers."]

It was revealed that Mr. Parker\u2019s accuser later committed suicide in 2012 at the age of 30. That disclosure prompted a backlash against the filmmaker. Some called to boycott the film. The movie\u2019s awards prospects dimmed dramatically. On Sunday, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d dedicated part of a segment to the controversy, with an unapologetic Mr. Parker saying he was \u201cfalsely accused\u201d and \u201cvindicated.\u201d All of that means the financial prospects for \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d are now murky. Some movie marketing experts say the question at this point, in fact, is not how the masses will receive the film but whether there will be any masses at all. Will women shun \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d because of the controversy about Mr. Parker\u2019s past? Do black audiences want to see another movie with slavery at its center? Will the potential lack of awards season buzz depress ticket sales, particularly overseas?

["travel", "A . If you go to East Africa, try Dorobo Tours in Arusha. They are not at all a typical tour group -- the guys grew up in Tanzania and have enormous respect for and knowledge of the wildlife and land in the region. You'll have a much easier time with transportation and logistics than if you went it alone. The tours are amazing, and they work with local villages on community-based conservation projects, meaning that part of the money you spend actually helps those whose land you camp and see animals on. Ask them to take you to Ol'Donyo Sambu, an amazing sight. There are no people or wild animals in this remote retreat. In Kenya, try the south coast around Diani Beach. You can go snorkeling on the coral reef there for next-to-nothing. Also in Kenya's Western Province, don't miss the Kakamega Rain Forest. The Rondo Retreat Centre, run by the Episcopal church, is a great place to stay. The forest is disappearing and will be gone in 20 years, so you shouldn't miss the chance to take a walk through one of the last remnants of the great rain forest that once stretched across the middle part of the continent. In the Great Rift Valley of Kenya, be sure to visit Lake Baringo's Island Camp. There are crocodiles in the river that runs through the island. This is not a rugged adventure-type place, but when they turn the generator off at night, the view of the night sky is unlike anything I've ever seen. In Uganda, you can go rafting at the source of the Blue Nile / Victoria Nyanza. I haven't tried this, but friends say that it's extremely dangerous and a great thrill. In central Africa, Cameroon's Mount Cameroon is a great sight, although it may be unsafe to climb this summer due to last year's eruptions. Limbe is a great beach town with lots of villages within easy, but seemingly remote, hiking distance. I've lived and traveled all over Africa and have found that people are almost uniformly friendly and welcoming to strangers, don't hesitate to go off the beaten path and enjoy the continent's amazing diversity. -- BibiSalama"]

["business", "General Motors Resists Expanding Victims\u2019 Fund - The New York Times The cars are different, but the circumstances surrounding their recall are strikingly similar. The ignition switch would suddenly shut off, drivers complained. Dealers were alerted to the problem. General Motors then quietly fixed the switch, without removing the faulty parts from circulation. And for more than a decade, there was no recall. Yet G.M. maintains that a distinct difference exists between its recall of 2.6 million older Chevrolet Cobalts and other cars, which started in February, and its more recent recall of 7.6 million cars like the Chevrolet Malibu, announced on June 30. For that reason, it has refused to expand a fund set up to compensate victims of the defective Cobalts, infuriating safety advocates. Its insistence comes even after new information filed with regulators was made public Friday that further detailed the similarities. \u201cThe compensation fund should be open clearly and readily to anyone who suffered death or injury as a result of these similar defects which were concealed in the same reprehensible way,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview Friday. G.M. has linked the faulty ignition in the Cobalts and Saturn Ions to 13 deaths and 54 accidents. In the most recent recalls involving the Malibu and other cars, the company said it was aware of seven crashes, eight injuries and three deaths."]
["business", "At a Senate committee hearing on Thursday, Mr. Blumenthal pressed Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, to justify the distinctions between the ignition recalls. In response, Ms. Barra stressed that the automaker\u2019s compensation plan related to \u201cvery specific issues\u201d and \u201ca series of mistakes that were made over a long period of time\u201d in the Cobalt family of vehicles. But the facts of the latest recall mirror those of the Cobalt defect. As with the Cobalt, G.M. learned of problems in the other vehicles more than a decade before issuing a recall. In 2003, the automaker heard that a customer complained about a Pontiac Grand Am suddenly shutting off, which would cut the engine and disable air bags, according to the regulatory filing made public Friday. In January of that year, the company opened an investigation. As with the Cobalt, G.M. warned dealers years in advance, issuing voice mail messages to dealerships in May 2003 that directed dealers to pay attention to the key size and mass of their customers\u2019 key rings. And as with the Cobalt, G.M. fixed the ignition switch without disclosing the problem to regulators or the public, but left defective switches in circulation that could be used in repairs on the cars. In July 2003, the automaker decided to fix the switch in some of the affected models, including the Malibu, Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile Alero. The part number was changed, but the old part remained available for servicing vehicles."]
["business", "Additionally, G.M. issued another work order in 2004 to fix the switch on the Pontiac Grand Prix \u2014 but the part number was not changed. Similarly, G.M. fixed the ignition on the Cobalt family of vehicles in 2006, but did not record the change with a new part number. This twist made it nearly impossible to distinguish between the old, defective switch and the new, improved switch. Alan Adler, a G.M. spokesman, said that part changes occurred regularly in vehicles, and \u201care not tantamount to a recall,\u201d and added that the cars with the part changes were recalled because they recently failed road tests. When asked why G.M.\u2019s compensation program was limited to those who were injured or who had family members who were killed in cars from the initial recall, Mr. Adler echoed Ms. Barra\u2019s comments from the Thursday hearing: The facts are different. But Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, an advocacy group, saw little difference. \u201cThe basic problem is that G.M. made a lot of ignitions that make cars prone to die in traffic, and that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she said. As for the compensation program, she said: \u201cIt should cover everybody injured by a G.M. product. Why is it limited now, just because this is a defect with the most notoriety? What\u2019s the justice in that?\u201d Beyond the complaint cited in the regulatory filing, drivers had been complaining to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about stalling in the recalled cars as far back as 1997, according to an analysis of government records by The New York Times."]

OBAMA: Well, obviously, I\u2019m very grateful to have my fellow presidents here, as well as the vice president. Before I begin, I want to say a few words about the situation in Syria. As you\u2019ve seen, today we\u2019ve released our unclassified assessment detailing with high confidence that the Syrian regime carried out a chemical weapons attack that killed well over a thousand people, including hundreds of children. This follows the horrific images that shocked us all. This kind of attack is a challenge to the world. We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale. This kind of attack threatens our national security interests by violating well-established international norms against the use of chemical weapons, by further threatening friends and allies of ours in the region like Israel and Turkey and Jordan, and it increases the risk that chemical weapons will be used in the future and fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us. So I have said before, and I meant what I said, that the world has an obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons."]
["world/middleeast", "Now, I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm.

We have been in conversations with all the interested parties.

But again, I repeat, we\u2019re not considering any open-ended commitment. We\u2019re not considering any boots-on-the-ground approach.

["opinion", "Turkey\u2019s E.U. Bid - The New York Times For 26 years, Turkey has been angling for membership in the European Union, only to see its bid thwarted. Now, with the union on the verge of reviving talks on Turkey\u2019s accession, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s outrageous crackdown on antigovernment protests in recent weeks is giving some Europeans a new excuse to question whether Turkey merits membership. Mr. Erdogan has refused to seek political compromise with protesters who opposed a plan to build a shopping mall and a mosque in a park in Taksim Square in Istanbul, and he has directed police to subdue them with tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets. Thousands have been detained, and at least four people have been killed. Mr. Erdogan and other officials have denigrated their critics as terrorists and accused them of planning to topple the government. The leaders have promised to deploy the Army if the police cannot contain the unrest. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s harsh, even dangerous, attacks on Europe and foreign journalists are at odds with the goal of membership in an economic union whose 35 criteria include a respect for civil rights, freedom of the press and other democratic values, as well as compliance with free-market principles. On Monday, after the 27-nation bloc criticized his authoritarian ways, he denounced the union as \u201canti-democratic\u201d and said he would no longer recognize the European Parliament."]

On Monday, however, Germany suggested a compromise that would postpone negotiations until the fall. European foreign ministers are supposed to decide how to proceed at a meeting on Tuesday. Mr. Erdogan deserves the strongest possible criticism, but membership in the European Union is a strategic imperative that, like NATO membership, is intended to bind Turkey to the West. Endeavoring to meet the bloc\u2019s criteria has already encouraged Turkey to make important political and economic reforms. Given the recent turmoil, Mr. Erdogan will have to show that he is willing to accept dissent in a democracy and capable of making further reforms. It would be a mistake, however, to fuel the estrangement between Europe and Turkey by shutting down the membership negotiations completely."]
["world/africa", "As the Need Grows, the Money for Global AIDS Runs Far Short - The New York Times Appeals to raise money for AIDS are ubiquitous \u2014 but the gap between what is needed and what is collected is enormous, and growing. In February, Michel Sidib\u00e9, the executive director of Unaids, estimated that $27 billion would be needed this year to fight the disease. Nothing close to that amount is on tap. Even counting what middle-income countries spend on AIDS in their own health budgets, the total has been estimated at $14 billion. The two chief sources of money are the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, begun under President George W. Bush and known as Pepfar, and the multinational Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Congress has authorized Pepfar to spend up to $48 billion by 2014, but the Obama administration has other plans. Its position, laid out by Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a White House health adviser and a brother of the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and underpinning the administration\u2019s new Global Health Initiative, is that more lives will be saved by focusing on childhood diseases and keeping young mothers alive. Pepfar\u2019s budget is about $7 billion a year and was last increased by 2 percent, so it has warned its aid recipients to expect no increases for at least two years. Its goal is four million people on drugs by 2014. AIDS activists are furious, insisting the result will be that children are saved only to die later of AIDS. But they appear to have lost that battle."]
["world/africa", "When the former United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, first proposed a global AIDS fund in 2001, he envisioned a pot of $7 billion to $10 billion, increasing each year. The United States donates 27 to 31 percent of the fund each year by matching the rest of the world\u2019s contributions at 50 cents on the dollar. But other nations have given so little that the Treasury has consistently paid out less than Congress authorized. The Obama administration\u2019s fiscal 2011 budget proposed a $50 million cut in the contribution. As of December, the fund had spent only $6 billion on AIDS since its founding. Last year, having received $3 billion less than it sought for the three diseases it fights, the fund cut grants by an average of 12 percent. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hugely difficult time,\u201d said its director, Dr. Michel D. Kazatchkine. In October, it will hold its next donor conference, and Dr. Kazatchkine hopes, under what he calls his most realistic \u201cmiddle scenario,\u201d to raise enough money to put six million AIDS victims on treatment over the next four years. So, optimistically, the fund and Pepfar could jointly have 10 million on treatment by the end of 2014. But by then, at least 36 million will be infected and 17 million in dire need. Other donors are so small they barely figure in projections. Starting in 1999, the World Bank lent about $1.5 billion to countries with epidemics. But it is closing those programs and now describes its AIDS role as \u201cfacilitator and knowledge contributor.\u201d"]

It has started a new campaign, called MassiveGood, to let visitors to travel Web sites donate $2 with each purchase. It hopes to double or triple its income. The (RED) campaign, started with great fanfare in 2006 by Bono and Bobby Shriver, arranges for companies like Apple, Armani, Gap, Converse and Starbucks to donate profits to the Global Fund from products with the (RED) logo. It raises about $30 million a year. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world\u2019s largest, with over $30 billion in assets. But while it has donated about $650 million to the Global Fund over the years, its focus is on cutting-edge medical research, not treatment. As Mr. Gates has said, trying to buy drugs for the world would quickly drain even his pockets. The Clinton Foundation has net assets of $168 million, putting it far below the richest 100. While its annual report boasts that it has \u201cinspired commitments worth $46 billion\u201d from others, its own grants, according to its 2008 tax return, totaled only $4 million.

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICAN RUNNING MATE; Cheney Finds That Bush Plan For Public Schools Hits Nerves - The New York Times As he campaigns around the country, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, stops in public schools nearly every week to lay out Gov. George W. Bush's education proposals. But at the last three such stops, Mr. Cheney has found himself sharply questioned by parents, teachers and students who are concerned that one of Governor Bush's central ideas -- his proposal to withhold federal funds from low-performing schools and give the money directly to parents -- would end up damaging the public school system. Mr. Cheney was questioned about the subject last week on a farm in Michigan, at a high school outside Cleveland, and twice at a high school in Marietta, Ohio -- where the editor of the school newspaper wondered what the effect the proposal would have in rural areas, and a teacher worried that charter schools in her state were not being held to the same standards as public schools. Today, during a visit to the Stevenson Elementary School here in Bellevue, a suburb about 10 miles east across Lake Washington from downtown Seattle, the public school proposal was the first issue raised when Mr. Cheney ended his short speech and held and question-and-answer session with the audience. ''My concern,'' said a woman who identified herself as a former public school teacher who now has three children in public schools, ''is for the proposed voucher program, and the money that could conceivably take away from the public schools.''"]
["us", "Mr. Cheney responded, ''We have not advocated vouchers, per se,'' explaining that the mechanism that parents could use to spend the money would be up to state and local governments to determine. ''The notion that we are somehow anti-public school is simply not the case,'' he said. ''We want the public schools to work. We want them to be as good as they were when we went to school.'' Mr. Cheney explained that under the Bush proposal, low-performing schools that failed to improve after three years would lose their federal Title I money -- financing that is allocated to help educate poor and disadvantaged students in public schools -- and that the money would be given directly to the children's parents. The parents could then use the money as a subsidy to send their children to a private school or a charter school, or to hire a tutor and send them to another public school. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has denounced the Bush proposal, saying it would harm public education. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Cheney defended the plan. ''We're not proposing to take the money away until the school fails,'' he said. ''But if the school fails -- if the school is unable to do what's necessary to provide for the children attending that school -- we think it's important that federal funds not be used to reinforce failure, that instead that there be accountability built into the system.''"]

The hapless Knicks, as anyone could have predicted, gave their home fans almost nothing to cheer about Thursday night. But there were few jeers at the arena, either. Something about booing such an inexperienced and untalented group may have felt wrong \u2014 or perhaps it just seemed pointless. The Knicks were on a two-game trip this week when they traded away three rotation players and shed any pretense about being a competitive group this season. So as the Knicks slumped to a 120-96 loss to the Houston Rockets in their first game back home, it was quiet. While the Knicks (5-34) were extending their franchise-record single-season losing streak to 14 games, the most noticeable protests were silent ones. Sitting along the baseline, near the visiting team\u2019s bench, were five fans wearing brown paper bags over their heads. The fans were shown on TNT\u2019s nationally televised broadcast, and pictures spread quickly on Twitter. The television cameras and microphones also captured Coach Derek Fisher delivering a motivational pep talk to his players that reinforced the image of the amateurish team. \u201cJust relax,\u201d Fisher told his players during an early timeout. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball. All the rules of the game are the same. The basket\u2019s the same height. They put their shorts on the same way you put yours on. Don\u2019t matter who it is over there. Believe in who you are.

["world", "Boutros-Ghali's Book Says Albright and Clinton Betrayed Him - The New York Times In a new book, former Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali lashes out at what he perceives as a betrayal by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the Clinton Administration for denying him a second term. Ms. Albright, who was America's United Nations representative at the time, comes in for the harshest treatment, not only for diplomatic double-face but also for what Mr. Boutros-Ghali sees as her lack of diplomatic skills. She campaigned to oust him from his job, he says, ''with determination, letting pass no opportunity to demolish my authority and tarnish my image all the while showing a serene face, wearing a friendly smile and repeating expressions of friendship and admiration.'' He adds that her efforts to remove him from the post made him recall ''what a Hindu scholar once said to me: There is no difference between diplomacy and deception.'' The central thesis of Mr. Boutros-Ghali's book -- titled ''Unvanquished: a U.S.-U.N. Saga'' (Random House) -- is that President Clinton felt obliged to deny him a second term early in the 1996 Presidential election campaign because Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican candidate, was accusing the Administration of putting the United Nations in charge of the American military by giving the Secretary General a veto over air strikes against the Serbs in Bosnia. ''His mocking pronunciation of my name -- Boo-trus, Boo-trus -- sounded like a jeering mob, and his claim that American troops served under my 'command' invariably aroused his audiences,'' Mr. Boutros-Ghali, a former Egyptian Foreign Minister, wrote."]
["world", "''Only once in every two decades did a U.N. and the U.S. Presidential election fall in the same year,'' he added. ''I knew that the U.N. decision might get caught up in American politics. It did.'' But the book also makes clear that Mr. Boutros-Ghali believed passionately in the independence of his office and that this led to frequent disagreements with Ms. Albright and the Administration over issues ranging from the Administration's distaste for the Bosnia peace plan put together by former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, its refusal to intervene more forcibly to stop the genocide in Rwanda, and America's failure to pay its United Nations dues. Mr. Boutros-Ghali is scathing in his assessment of Ms. Albright's diplomatic skills. She seemed to have, he writes, ''little interest in the difficult diplomatic work of persuading her foreign counterparts to go along with the positions of her Government, preferring to lecture or speak in declarative sentences, or simply to read verbatim from her briefing books.'' ''She seemed to assume,'' he continues, ''that her mere assertion of a U.S. policy should be sufficient to achieve the support of other nations.'' He also found her unusually sensitive to criticism, saying, ''She tended to react to discussions of problems between the United Nations and the United States as if they were criticisms specifically directed at her performance.''"]
["world", "But Mr. Boutros-Ghali admits that he underestimated her as an opponent. When Joseph Verner Reed, an American who was an Under Secretary General, reported hearing her say, ''I will make Boutros think I am his friend; then I will break his legs,'' he dismissed the story as ''ridiculous,'' only to conclude later that he had been naive. ''Fortune is a woman, Machiavelli said, and should be treated roughly,'' he wrote, ''but in this case it was the woman who was rough, and fortune favored her.'' Responding to the book, Ms. Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, who said he discussed the issues with her, defended her treatment of the former Secretary General and added that Ms. Albright had acted not only in the best American interest but also in the interest of American political support for the United Nations. ''She did what she thought was right, and she thought she did it effectively,'' he said. He laid the blame for Mr. Boutros-Ghali's ouster with the former Secretary General himself. ''It was always unfortunate that Mr. Boutros-Ghali did not have the skills to successfully manage the most important relationship for any Secretary General, which is smooth cooperation with the United States,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''It led to his downfall, so it is not surprising that he is bitter.'' He added that Mr. Boutros Ghali envisioned a ''grandiose role'' for himself at the United Nations, which the Clinton Administration could not support. He also called it ''ironic'' to hear that Mr. Boutros-Ghali thought Ms. Albright was unduly sensitive to criticism, given the tone of his remarks in the book. He said she ''always viewed him as intelligent and thoughtful, and wishes him well.''"]
["world", "In the book, Mr. Boutros-Ghali strongly criticizes the Administration's legacy at the United Nations and its performance in key areas, like Bosnia during its 1992-95 war. When the United Nations was allowed to do its work without substantial United States involvement, as in Mozambique, the operation succeeded, he says. The world body also did well, he says, when the United States needed its help, as in Haiti. But when the United States ''wanted to appear actively involved while in reality avoiding hard decisions, as in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda, the United Nations was abused, or blamed by the United States and the operations failed, tragically and horribly.'' During their campaign to block his re-election, Mr. Boutros-Ghali says neither Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher nor Ms. Albright would tell him why they were doing so. Even after Kofi Annan's election in his stead, Mr. Boutros-Ghali wrote, Ms. Albright was studiously vague on the subject. At their final dinner together in the Secretary General's Sutton Place residence, Ms. Albright would only say that he symbolized the United Nations, which was unpopular in Congress and was ''blamed for trying to control American military power'' through the ''dual key''' system that gave him veto power over NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. He vainly protested that she knew it was the commanders of the United Nations peacekeeping force on the ground in Bosnia who opposed air strikes, fearing they would turn the Bosnian Serbs against their soldiers."]

Imagine that you are watching a rat running around on a floor completely covered with hexagonal tiles, all the same size. Every time the rat passes the point of one of the 60-degree angles, you press a button to send out an electrical signal. You, in essence, are a grid cell, except that you can see the tiled floor, while the grid cell has no eyes, is buried in the middle of the brain and functions wherever the rat goes, no matter what the floor looks like. Somehow, it gets news of the rat\u2019s movement and passes on that news in the form of these electrical bursts. There are many thousands of other grid cells like you. And each of them is working the same way, except that for each, the pattern of tiles is shifted just a bit in one direction or another. For some, the smallest tiles are something like 12 inches on a side, although the actual length varies in individual animals. For others, they are larger. Some even reach five feet on a side. All of them together send a stream of signals that track the rat\u2019s position on thousands of overlapping grids."]
["science", "This basic finding was reported in 2005 by the Mosers and their students Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn and Sturla Molden. The Mosers have continued to study the cells, revealing more about their origin and the details of their connections in the brain. At the end of last year they reported that the scale of the grids not only varies, but makes discrete jumps. If one group of cells works on a 12-inch scale, the next works on a scale exactly 1.42 times greater \u2014 17 inches. It is a geometric progression built into the brain, imposed on an irregular world. JAMES GORMAN"]

Valcke, who has been FIFA\u2019s secretary general and Mr. Blatter\u2019s trusted executive since 2007, has resisted calls to resign in light of allegations of corruption at the organization, but he said on Friday that he anticipated FIFA\u2019s next president would name a new secretary general. \u201cIf I would be the next FIFA president, I would take a new general secretary, so yes, whoever becomes president should have a new general secretary because it is the most important relationship for any organization,\u201d said Mr. Valcke, speaking in St. Petersburg, Russia, at a news conference before Saturday\u2019s draw for the 2018 World Cup qualifying tournament. Asked what he would do when he leaves FIFA, Mr. Valcke, 54, said, \u201cWhat I want to do with my life is just a question about me and myself.\u201d Fourteen soccer officials and sports marketing executives have been indicted in the United States as part of its investigation into corruption at FIFA, while the Swiss inquiry is examining potential improprieties related to the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting rights. Neither Mr. Valcke nor Mr. Blatter has been directly charged in either investigation, but, as the governing body\u2019s two top officials, they are under scrutiny. Mr. Valcke has been linked to a wire transfer of $10 million that the Justice Department considers suspicious and believes was related to the bidding for the 2010 World Cup hosting rights."]
["sports/soccer", "There have also been persistent questions and criticism from FIFA\u2019s corporate partners. Three crucial sponsors \u2014 Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald\u2019s \u2014 have been particularly vocal, and Mr. Valcke said on Friday that FIFA would hold a meeting next month with representatives from those companies to fully explain what FIFA is doing to overhaul itself. Mr. Valcke acknowledged that FIFA\u2019s current state of affairs had made it difficult to complete new agreements with sponsors. \u201cThe current situation doesn\u2019t help to finalize any new agreements,\u201d Mr. Valcke said. \u201cThat is a fact.\u201d FIFA has not signed any new major sponsors since the 2014 World Cup \u2014 a noticeable gap \u2014 and while Mr. Valcke said that negotiations were being held with two companies that he did not name, he conceded that it was unlikely that any deals would be announced before the presidential election on Feb. 26, 2016. FIFA\u2019s executive committee has announced some of the changes it hopes to put in place, although it also said the overhaul would be led by its own ethics committee, a move that some governance experts have panned because it would not be truly independent. Mr. Blatter has stated repeatedly that his main goal before leaving office after serving just nine months of his fifth four-year term is to see FIFA make significant changes to the way it operated."]
["sports/soccer", "Still, many fans and soccer officials outside FIFA believe no meaningful change is possible without a significant overhaul of the organization\u2019s structure. That, of course, includes its leadership, and Mr. Blatter said at a news conference this week that external pressure had played a significant part in his decision to call for a special election. Mr. Valcke, the administrative head of FIFA, has been more confrontational in his few meetings with journalists since the investigations became known publicly. He initially denied having any connection to the $10 million wire transfer that FIFA sent to the Caribbean football association on behalf of the South African federation. The United States authorities say they believe that transfer was a bribe. In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Valcke said, in part, \u201cI have not authorized such payment.\u201d He backtracked when a letter describing the transaction, with his signature, was later obtained by the Press Association of Britain. On Friday, Mr. Valcke reiterated his denial of wrongdoing, saying that as an administrator, he was only carrying out directives as ordered by the executive committee and by other FIFA leaders. \u201cYou are asking me if I am responsible for what has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am really involved. I don\u2019t think I am of anything to do in this case.\u201d He added that he did not have any concerns about traveling abroad, unlike Mr. Blatter, who has said he did not want to \u201ctake the risk\u201d of leaving Switzerland because of the investigations, presumably because of concerns about arrest and extradition."]

Mr. Valcke also provided an update on the construction for the 2018 World Cup.

["world/europe", "For Crimea, It\u2019s Russian Troops In, Tourists Out - The New York Times YALTA, Crimea \u2014 When choosing the idyllic setting for an extramarital affair, Anton Chekhov opted for Yalta, and this seaside resort proved so grateful that it erected a bronze statue of the fictional enchantress with her Pomeranian on the main boardwalk. Back when \u201cThe Lady With the Dog\u201d was published, Crimea\u2019s southern coast rivaled the French Riviera. Chekhov, who wrote several famous works in his study here with its red walls and stained glass window, was unequivocal in his enthusiasm. \u201cThe coast of Crimea is beautiful, cozy, and I like it better than the Riviera,\u201d he wrote more than 100 years ago, according to the permanent exhibition at his estate. \u201cYalta is better than Nice.\u201d That was perhaps the most famous endorsement of Crimea until President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia came along. Having annexed the Black Sea peninsula in March, Mr. Putin has since become the main promoter of it as a Russian holiday destination, and for good reason. With its already bedraggled economy flatlining, Crimea desperately needs a banner year in tourism, its No. 1 industry. But right now, the summer is looking like a washout, travel experts say. Few Ukrainians and virtually no Westerners are expected any time soon. \u201cThere will be no tourist season this year,\u201d fretted Lilia Ivanova, indicating the quiet harbor near her tour agency. The first cruise ship scheduled to visit this year, the M.S. Hamburg, steamed past without stopping. All international flights were halted with the annexation."]
["world/europe", "Last year, six million tourists visited Crimea \u2014 almost four million Ukrainians, and the bulk of the rest Russians. About 12 percent were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships that docked in 2013, according to tour operators. Virtually all of those dockings have been canceled this year. It doesn\u2019t help that Yalta \u2014 indeed, much of Crimea \u2014 fell prey first to the Soviet penchant for concrete and then to the more modern plague of endlessly homogeneous chain stores and apartment blocks. The place needs a little work, and many here hope that the Kremlin will provide it. In April, Mr. Putin announced that he had ordered the price of round-trip airplane tickets for vacationers from Russia slashed to $214, compared with a normal fare of about $385 from Moscow, and subsidized train tickets. State-run companies like Gazprom and Rosneft said they would underwrite vacations for tens of thousands of employees. Some Russians who work for government-owned companies have told their friends that they were ordered to vacation in Crimea this year. State-run television inaugurated a relentless campaign plugging the peninsula: Caves! Waterfalls! Palaces! Yuri Gagarin vacationed here! (Gagarin, the first man in space, remains a Russian archetype, used to plug almost any state goal.) But even Mr. Putin spoke bluntly about the limits of its attractions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t offer cheap tickets, people simply won\u2019t go,\u201d he said in announcing the subsidies. \u201cGiven its current infrastructure, Crimea is designed for people with small incomes.\u201d"]
["world/europe", "Sunshine, agriculture and the dilapidated Black Sea fleet are the three main pillars the Kremlin expects to exploit in its push to transform Crimea into an economic success story that proves the benefits of Mother Russia\u2019s embrace. There has also been talk of casinos. Propping up Crimea will be a difficult, expensive effort. Russia has earmarked $5 billion just to save the Black Sea fleet from the scrap heap. Agricultural exports face transportation issues because the peninsula is geographically remote from Russia. But tourism presents some of the biggest challenges. After being the playground of royalty, Crimea remained a cherished summer vacation destination in the Soviet Union, as few Soviets were allowed to travel abroad. It offered some of the only warm beaches available. So tourism has long been a cornerstone of the economy. Traditionally, a vast majority of tourists arrived by train, with most Russians crossing through Ukraine. For the past two months, however, television news in Russia, monopolized by the state, has depicted Ukraine as brimming with neo-Nazis bent on shedding Russian blood. The threat was largely invented, but it frightened potential visitors. Initially, Russia and its allies running Crimea vowed to match, if not increase, the number of tourists from last year, but they then began to scale back expectations. The acting head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, was recently quoted telling local reporters that the government expected at least three million tourists."]
["world/europe", "As if to hedge their bets, Mr. Putin and his allies wasted no time in accusing Ukraine of benign neglect. Ukraine received Crimea from Moscow in 1954, then ruled the area for 23 years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Moscow blames Kiev for every flaw, from the decrepit ships Russia seized to low agricultural exports, which Mr. Putin said dropped 60 percent under Ukrainian rule. Russian government inspectors, the president lamented during a recent national television broadcast, found Crimea\u2019s hotels and resorts terribly shabby. \u201cSome of these, if not all, cannot be used under Russian sanitary and epidemiological standards,\u201d Mr. Putin said. (This in a place once famous for sanitariums.) He went on: \u201cWhen they asked how former vacationers could have put up with this sort of quality, they heard this odd, and shameful, answer: \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we mostly had miners as guests here. It made no difference to them; they\u2019d down half a glass of vodka and go to the beach.\u2019 But we can\u2019t take this approach with Russian vacationers.\u201d Tour operators said the legions of Russian tourists wanting to lounge could find far nicer beaches, bigger buffets and better hotels in convenient, inexpensive destinations like Turkey or Egypt, safely distant from the urban unrest in those countries."]
["world/europe", "\u201cThe whole idea of tourism in this area is a little different,\u201d said Sergei V. Ivashin, the young general director of a Moscow franchise for Pegas Touristik, a major Russian tour operator. \u201cCrimea is not for people who want to lie on the beach in Egypt and eat eight meals a day, but people who want to see the culture and history of their own land, their own country. We are aiming for those kinds of nationalist tours.\u201d There is plenty of Russian history here. The biggest draw, with 782,000 visitors in 2013, according to the Tourism Ministry, is Livadia, the Italian Renaissance palace the last czar, Nicholas II, erected in 1911. But Crimea has definitely seen better times. Take Chekhov\u2019s home. The writer settled here in 1898, drawn, like so many, to treat his tuberculosis. He built a modest white house. He wrote \u201cThe Cherry Orchard\u201d and \u201cThree Sisters\u201d here, among other works. Sergei Rachmaninoff accompanied the opera bass Fyodor Chaliapin on Chekhov\u2019s black upright piano. Leo Tolstoy visited. Unlike many Russian museums ransacked during the 1917 revolution, this one still has authentic furnishings because Chekhov\u2019s sister and his widow lived here for decades after his death in 1904. But giant apartment towers have encroached on Chekhov\u2019s unbroken view of the sea and have badly affected the house itself. When cracks developed about 18 months ago, museum officials went to court to stop the construction of a nearby apartment building, guides said."]

In oft-frozen Russia, no ruler can really do wrong by adding hundreds of miles of warm beachfront property, said Natalya V.

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR; Bush Says Plan on Taxes Would Aid 2-Job Parents - The New York Times Gov. George W. Bush began his bid today to gain the allegiance of the middle class, arguing that his tax-cut plan would relieve the pressure on parents who were forced to hold more than one job to make ends meet. Mr. Bush used the issue of tax cuts to open a six-day, nine-state drive to showcase proposals that his campaign said would help middle-income Americans from ''cradle to grave.'' His first stop was in President Clinton's home state of Arkansas, which polls show to be a tossup. In a line he repeated throughout the day, Mr. Bush said his plan for a $1.3 trillion tax cut over the next decade would give tax relief to all Americans while Vice President Al Gore's proposal for $500 billion in ''targeted'' tax cuts would leave out millions of taxpayers. ''My plan gives people options, not orders,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that ''there's a lot of fine print'' in Mr. Gore's plan. ''It's so targeted that it misses the target,'' Mr. Bush said. His drive to court the middle class came as opinion polls showed Mr. Gore edging ahead in the presidential race, making inroads with voters in households earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year and also making gains with women."]
["us", "Hoping to stem Mr. Gore's advance, Mr. Bush has put a new focus on fighting Mr. Gore head to head on the issues. At a Catholic hospital in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Bush said it was an ''important week in this campaign, a week that speaks to the aspirations and hopes of middle-class families all across the country.'' His running mate, Dick Cheney, and his aides continued efforts today to hammer away at Mr. Gore's credibility. Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, distributed an article from The Boston Globe that challenged Mr. Gore's assertions that his mother-in-law paid nearly three times as much for the same arthritis medicine that was used by his ailing dog Shiloh. The article said that the figures Mr. Gore used came from a House Democratic study and that Mr. Gore's aides could not say for sure whether his mother-in-law and dog actually took the drug, Lodine. Ms. Hughes noted that reporters had focused on how Mr. Bush sometimes mangles words, and said, ''This is not a case of mispronunciation. This is a case of direct misstatement of facts.'' Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, called the Bush campaign's focus on the article, ''the latest sign the Bush-Cheney ticket is very, very desperate.'' And she said the campaign had verified that both Mr. Gore's mother-in-law and dog had used the same drug. Despite Mr. Bush's desire to focus on issues, he also made it clear that he would continue to raise questions about the vice president's character and credibility."]
["us", "''I would rather fight the fight on issues and on philosophy,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview with Fox News, ''but I'm not going to squander the opportunity. I will not let this man distance himself from the previous administration.'' His aides said that in large measure, his drive this week was focused on women. While Democrats in recent campaigns have done better among women than Republicans, Mr. Bush had made headway earlier this year by stressing education. But the traditional ''gender gap'' has reopened. Ms. Hughes said the gap had occurred because Mr. Gore had ''misrepresented'' the governor's record and ''that also he's managed to unfortunately muddy the waters on the issue of education.'' Mr. Bush toured the maternity ward at St. Vincent Doctors Hospital in Little Rock at his first stop today and delivered his speech standing next to two families with babies. Later this week Mr. Bush will appear on Oprah Winfrey's syndicated television program in Chicago and on the Regis Philbin show, both programs that appeal to women. The governor's wife, Laura, was campaigning with him today. Asked about her husband by an audience member in Little Rock, Ark., she said, ''his best character quality is his good heart.'' ''I see that every day in the way he relates to our children, to our pets even,'' Mrs. Bush said. Mr. Gore also kept up his courtship of women today, talking about health care in Las Vegas."]
["us", "In a speech at the University of Nevada, Mr. Gore said: ''The issue today is whether or not we will have a president who stands up and fights for families who need health care, for the women who need health care, for the children, all of whom should have health care, and against the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies that are always standing in the way!'' He also spoke to health care workers at the university and was joined by the tennis star Andre Agassi, whose mother and sister have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Mr. Bush's emphasis on the financial problems of the middle class seems to draw inspiration from the success of Mr. Gore's recent appeals. Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Gore released an economic blueprint with broad social goals including eliminating the national debt, increasing personal savings and homeownership and reducing poverty. The Bush campaign countered  with a 16-page booklet, ''Blueprint for the Middle Class,'' which summarizes Mr. Bush's domestic agenda. Mr. Bush held the pamphlet aloft. ''This pamphlet here outlines exactly what I'm talking about,'' he said. Later in in Kansas City, Mo.,, he credited Ronald Reagan for the current economic expansion saying the ''growth of today is occurring because of the tax cuts of the 1980's.'' Mr. Bush told Fox News in the interview that he would speed up tax cuts in a recession. ''I'm from the school of thought that it's important during a recession to give people their money back faster,'' he said. ''That may cause us to run a short-term deficit but the fundamental question is how to cause the economy to grow.''"]

Tonight, Mr. Bush flew here and was honored by the local Fraternal Order of Police. In the group's union hall, Mr. Bush kneeled and held a microphone for Jim Mullen, a former police officer who was shot and paralyzed from the neck down in 1996 and is now in a wheelchair. Mr. Mullen had trouble speaking, but he gasped out praise for the governor. When he finished, Mr. Bush leaned over and kissed him on the forehead."]

On Tuesday, fighters with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, said they had shot down a Syrian military aircraft over their stronghold in the northern city of Raqqa, in what antigovernment activists said was a first for the Islamic State. Syrian-led insurgent groups have brought down numerous Syrian military planes and helicopters in the past, but such attacks have grown rare recently as rivals of the Islamic State struggle to maintain arms supplies. The downed plane crashed into a house, killing eight occupants, said an activist in Raqqa who refused to give his name for fear of reprisal. Amid a three-year civil war that pits the government of President Bashar al-Assad against many insurgent and often rival factions, new attacks by the government in eastern Syria and in Damascus by opponents of the Islamic State demonstrated the volatility of the situation on the ground. It also showed the difficulty for the United States in striking the militants without allowing the Syrian government or Qaeda-linked insurgents to take advantage of any weakening of the Islamic State."]

He said Washington should share intelligence with Syria and put pressure on Turkey to better track the flow of militants into Syria and on the Saudis to stop promoting extremist Islamic ideology. In Damascus on Tuesday, security forces carried out intensive raids in the Midan neighborhood, after insurgents not affiliated with the Islamic State infiltrated the district at dawn on Monday and clashed with government troops.

Mr. Bush was referring to an article on Thursday in The New York Times that reported the Justice Department had started a preliminary investigation into the manner in which Democrats raised money from trial lawyers in 1995 and 1996. The article noted the existence of a memorandum that suggested a link between Democrats' solicitation of contributions from trial lawyers and President Clinton's veto of legislation that would have significantly curbed the size of the financial judgments that juries can award in civil cases.

Pilots negotiate the space themselves, working out safe distances from one another by using a tactic as simple as it sounds: \u201csee and avoid.\u201d Stretching from Governors Island in the south to the George Washington Bridge in the north, the airspace buzzes with helicopters on sightseeing tours or ferrying Wall Street executives. Airplane pilots use it as a shortcut \u2014 the only efficient way to fly through the city without getting tangled in commercial airspace or being forced to interact with the air traffic controllers who manage its three major airports. The Hudson River corridor is a through highway of sorts for  aircraft flying below 1,100 feet. Southbound planes and choppers hug the New Jersey coastline; northbound ones hew close to the West Side of Manhattan. \u201cIt is a two-lane street that has no air traffic controllers directing these aircraft,\u201d said Jim Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The chatter inside the corridor is rapid-fire, said Paul Dudley, a pilot who has flown helicopters for 20 years.

After the New York Yankees pitcher Corey Lidle and his flight instructor were killed when their plane crashed into a building on the East Side in October 2006, federal officials banned all aircraft except seaplanes and helicopters from the East River corridor without specific permission from air traffic controllers. Mr. Peters said that restriction \u201cremains in effect today.\u201d"]
["nyregion", "On Saturday, a new round of scrutiny was called for, this time as Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey and others said they hoped there would be an examination of the rules regarding air traffic above the Hudson. \u201cI would hope that in due course that maybe we will have to take a step back and look at the traffic flow so we can protect folks and their families,\u201d Mr. Corzine said, speaking in Hoboken. Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, zeroed in on two issues \u2014 communications and coordination. He noted that planes usually fly north or south along the river while helicopters can fly east to west, causing a potential for conflicting trajectories. And he questioned how small planes and helicopters interact. Officials, pilots and others said the Hudson River corridor is different from the East River space, so the relevant issues vary, as do the political and governmental interests at play. The Hudson corridor is wider than its counterpart, with more room to navigate. Perhaps most significantly, it does not dead-end, and  is seen, in part, as an aid to commerce because it lets small planes stay out of the way of big planes and not burden the air traffic system. Controlling the space by shutting it off to aircraft is not realistic or wanted, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. \u201cIt may be one of those things where no amount of restrictions, other than preventing aircraft from coming into the area, could have prevented,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not something that anybody wants either.\u201d"]
["nyregion", "Mr. Peters said such uncontrolled spaces are common in some areas in the nation, particularly in urban areas like Los Angeles and Phoenix. Though he said no official tally of the traffic in such areas is kept, many planes rely on such  space to get around, and most of them navigate it successfully. It often comes down to the skill of the pilots and their familiarity with the nuances of the airspace. \u201cA good pilot knows before he goes,\u201d Mr. Peters said. It was not known how often the pilot of the plane that crashed Saturday had been in the Hudson River corridor."]
["international", "President Hints He Will Halt War if bin Laden Is Handed Over - The New York Times WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 \u2014 President Bush said today that United States forces would attack Afghanistan for \"as long as it takes\" to destroy the Qaeda terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, but he offered to reconsider the military assault on Afghanistan if that country's ruling Taliban would surrender Mr. bin Laden. At a news conference in the White House, Mr. Bush also embraced for the first time the idea that the United Nations could play a central role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan after an eventual ousting of the radical Islamic Taliban government. Mr. Bush tonight gave the Taliban another chance to halt America's military action by handing over Mr. bin Laden. \"If you cough him up and his people today, then we'll reconsider what we are doing to your country,\" he said. \"You still have a second chance.\" \"Just bring him in,\" he added. \"And bring his leaders and lieutenants and other thugs and criminals with him.\" Addressing how long American forces would be in Afghanistan, Mr. Bush said: \"This particular battle front will last as long as it takes to bring Al Qaeda to justice. It may happen tomorrow, it may happen a month from now, it may take a year or two, but we will prevail.\""]
["international", "Mr. Bush made a confident entrance to the formal setting of the East Room down a long red carpet, mounted his podium and delivered his opening statement in the somber tones of a leader in the midst of war. During 45 minutes of questioning, he made no verbal slip of any significance, resorted to humor at times, and otherwise conveyed the seriousness of the moment through a new gravitas \u2014 seeming grayer, graver and more comfortable in the role. He said Americans would have to get used to living with the kind of F.B.I. warning that was issued today about the threat of possible terrorist attacks in the United States in the next few days. \"This is not the first time the Justice Department has acted like this,\" the president said. \"I hope it is the last. But given the attitude of the evil doers, it may not be.\" It was one of many occasions on which he used the word \"evil\" to describe the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The effect was to cast the battle against terrorism on which the country has embarked in almost biblical terms. On the fifth day of United States bombing raids against targets in Afghanistan, Mr. Bush described what he said would be a robust American commitment \u2014 even asking every American child to send a dollar to the White House \u2014 to rebuild Afghanistan, a nation destroyed by two decades of civil war and invasion."]
["international", "\"It would be a useful function for the United Nations to take over the `nation building,' \" he said. \"I would call it the stabilization of a future government after our military mission is complete.\" That amounted to a substantial policy shift. It was the first time that the president had made an explicit commitment to involvement in Afghanistan beyond an ousting of the Taliban. He has previously been dismissive of \"nation building\" in devastated or failed states. Mr. Bush's news conference was the first he had held in the formal setting of the East Room, and the first in prime time. His advisers said a president who until now rarely veered from a script had grown far more comfortable since Sept. 11 with the give-and-take from reporters. His answers were forthright and forthcoming, an evolution from the guarded tone of the first months of his presidency. When asked if the F.B.I.'s general warning today accomplished little more than scaring people from resuming their daily lives, the president said the public should expect such alerts when the government receives threats, vague or specific. \"On our TV screens the other day, we saw the evil one threatening, calling for more destruction and death in America,\" Mr. Bush said, referring to Mr. bin Laden. \"I think the American people should be \u2014 take comfort in the fact that their government is doing everything we possibly can do to run down every possible lead and take threats \u2014 and we take threats seriously.\""]
["international", "At the same time, he sought to reassure the country, saying many Americans were returning to regular routines, as much as they could after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said, for instance, that air travel and hotel bookings were picking up. \"We are getting back to normal,\" he said. \"We're doing so with a new sense of awareness.\" In general, the president sought to tread a fine line between reassuring Americans and telling them to be on their guard against possible future attack. He urged them to go on with their lives because to do otherwise would be to give a victory to terrorism; at the same time, he called for vigilance. Behind his appeal lurked at least this pressing consideration: The American economy is faltering, and if Americans do not return to something close to business as usual, the impact is likely to be severe. The president said there were logical steps Americans could take to forestall another attack, but when asked to give some practical advice about what Americans should be on guard against, he resorted to humor. \"If you find a person that you've never seen before getting in a crop duster that doesn't belong to you, report it,\" he said to laughter. Vice President Dick Cheney has been kept sequestered in an unspecified \"secure location\" for much of the last two weeks. The president said that Mr. Cheney was in the Oval Office this afternoon, but that they had an obligation to insure that one of them would be available to lead if the other was killed."]
["international", "\"We take very seriously the notion of the continuity of government,\" he said. \"It's a responsibility we share, to make sure that under situations such as this, when there are possible threats facing our government, that we separate ourselves for the sake of continuity of our government.\" He added that he had \"welcomed\" Mr. Cheney \"out of his secure location,\" as if the vice president were back from confinement, and reported that \"he's looking swell.\" The president closed his news conference with an appeal to the nation's children to help the children of Afghanistan. He urged each American child to send a dollar to the White House for a new fund to be run by the American Red Cross, to provide relief aid for Afghan children. \"One in three Afghan children is an orphan,\" Mr. Bush said. \"Almost half suffer chronic malnutrition. And we can and must help them.\" On the subject of security, Mr. Bush said that if federal officials received \"specific intelligence,\" a credible threat against a specific building or city, \"I can assure you our government will do everything\" it can to protect citizens there. That, he said, is what his administration did after receiving information that an operative from Al Qaeda might spread toxic chemicals from a crop duster plane. Mr. Bush said the primary lesson he had learned from Vietnam was that it is impossible to fight a guerrilla war with only conventional forces. The United States and its allies now, he continued, were not only using military force but also cutting off the money that allows the terrorists to operate and rounding up suspected members of terrorist groups at home and abroad."]
["international", "\"Slowly but surely we're smoking Al Qaeda out of their caves so we can bring them to justice,\" he said. \"This particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring Al Qaeda to justice.\" \"I am determined to stay the course,\" the president added. \"We must rid the world of terrorists so our children and grandchildren can grow up in freedom.\" Can you rid the world of terrorism if you cannot find Osama bin Laden to kill him, Mr. Bush was asked. He answered: \"I don't know if he's dead or alive. I want him brought to justice, however.\" He said the United States was following every possible lead to make sure that every member of Al Qaeda who might be in the United States is brought to justice. \"We're chasing down the leads,\" he said. He said that while the administration's focus was on Afghanistan, it was also monitoring President Saddam Hussein of Iraq closely. \"There's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man,\" he said. \"We're watching him very carefully.\" When asked if he would meet Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, Mr. Bush said he supported the aborted peace effort in the Middle East, but would leave that task to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, unless promising developments emerged. \"My calendar's a little crowded right now,\" he said. \"But if I'm convinced that a meeting with a particular party will further the process, I will do so.\""]
["international", "The president warned Americans against singling out people by race or religion. \"Don't use this as an opportunity to pick on someone who doesn't look like you or who doesn't share your religion,\" he said. \"If you see something suspicious or abnormal, report it to local law enforcement.\" Would he ask the American people to make sacrifices? The president said people already were sacrificing in ways both practical, like longer lines at airports, and spiritual. \"There's a certain sacrifice when you lose a piece of your soul,\" Mr. Bush said. He went on to say that positive things have come from the attacks by bringing Americans together and putting on display the nation's tolerance for Islam and all religions. \"I believe many people are reassessing what's important in life,\" Mr. Bush said. \"Moms and dads are not only reassessing their marriage and the importance of marriage, but the necessity of loving their children like never before.\" The level of compassion in the United States is \"overflowing,\" he said."]

DraftKings said that it was \u201cconfident in our legal position\u201d and that it intended to keep operating in New York. In separate complaints filed Friday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, FanDuel and DraftKings first asked a judge for an injunction, arguing that the attorney general, Eric T.

On Monday, DraftKings, which is based in Boston, and FanDuel, which is based in New York, asked Justice Manuel Mendez for an immediate restraining order to stop Mr. Schneiderman until they could present their case. Each company said it faced irreparable damage. DraftKings said that it had 375,000 New Yorkers among its 2.5 million players and that Mr. Schneiderman had told the company\u2019s vendors in letters that it was at risk of not doing business in New York anymore. FanDuel said that it had hundreds of thousands of users in New York \u2014 among more than one million over all \u2014 and that it had been unable to process New Yorkers\u2019 deposits since Friday.

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBATES; Bush, Facing Criticism, Abandons Debate Stance - The New York Times Gov. George W. Bush abandoned his effort to impose his own schedule of presidential debates today, and his campaign said it was prepared to sit down with aides to Vice President Al Gore to work out an agreement for debating under the auspices of a bipartisan commission. Mr. Gore's advisers responded that they were willing to meet with the Bush campaign. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the bipartisan panel that has been organizing the debates since 1988, said it had received a call today from Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, Don Evans, and immediately began trying to arrange a meeting with representatives of both campaigns next week in Washington. But the governor's decision did not appear to guarantee that Mr. Bush would sign off on the commission's original plan for three debates next month on college campuses in Boston, Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis, all of which Mr. Gore has agreed to. Advisers to Mr. Bush continued to insist that while the campaign might agree to two of the commission's debates, it remained opposed to the Boston event and wanted to replace it with a network-sponsored debate, perhaps with CNN's Larry King as moderator. ''Everybody knows there have got to be two commission debates, and everybody knows there has to be an agreement soon,'' an adviser to Mr. Bush said."]
["us", "Aides to Mr. Bush repeated their position that Boston was not acceptable, because the debate was scheduled to be held on the University of Massachusetts campus adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Library, which honors a Democratic president. ''I can't think of any reason in the world why we'd do that,'' the adviser said. The Bush campaign announced the shift in the face of what aides to the governor described as mounting criticism from prominent Republicans, and a desire to put a distracting issue to rest. Mr. Bush made the proposal on Sunday night, challenging Mr. Gore to two network debates, one on CNN and one on NBC, in addition to one sponsored by the commission. Because the network debates were likely to attract far fewer viewers than the commission debates, which were to be broadcast on multiple networks and cable outlets, many Democrats accused Mr. Bush of trying to avoid wide exposure. And while Mr. Bush tried to use Mr. Gore's rejection of the idea to raise questions about the vice president's credibility, even some members of Mr. Bush's staff suggested that the strategy was not working. Nonetheless, Bush advisers sought today to shift blame for the collapse of their proposal to Mr. Gore, saying he had made it clear he would not attend a debate proposed by Mr. Bush for next week on a prime-time edition of ''Meet the Press'' on NBC."]
["us", "''NBC News has told us that they have received a letter from Vice President Gore indicating that he will not attend the debate next Tuesday night,'' Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, told reporters in a brief stop here. Ms. Hughes added that Mr. Gore's refusal came ''despite the fact that he had accepted that debate and said he will debate anytime, anywhere.'' ''NBC News reiterated today that they will not host the debate unless both candidates are there,'' she said. NBC News and the Gore campaign disputed the suggestion by Ms. Hughes that the letter was news. Mr. Gore's aides announced days ago that the vice president would not participate. And Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman, said the network has had that rejection letter from William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, since Sunday, the day Mr. Bush unveiled his plan. Mark Fabiani, the Gore campaign communications director, said: ''We sent that letter within an hour of Governor Bush's press conference. We faxed it to Tim Russert at his home and at his office.'' Mr. Russert is the host of ''Meet the Press.'' After learning today that Mr. Bush had abandoned his plan, Mr. Daley said he welcomed the opportunity to meet with the governor's staff, but he seemed inclined to stick with the commission's original plan of three debates. ''We'll go in and hear what they have to say,'' he said. ''Right now, our attitude is three. It's only four and a half hours in a campaign that lasts thousands of hours.''"]
["us", "Mr. Bush had contended that his proposal, which included the 90-minute debate in St. Louis sponsored by the commission, plus two 60-minute debates, on ''Meet the Press'' on Tuesday and ''Larry King Live'' on Oct. 3, was an effort to invigorate the debates. Mr. Gore, however, sought to characterize the proposal  as an effort to limit viewership. Two major networks left out of the Bush plan, ABC and CBS, announced that they would not carry debates on rivals' programs. Debate commission officials have repeatedly said they are willing to negotiate over the formats of the debates, and would even entertain suggestions for moderators. But they have been less willing to forgo the debate sites, which were chosen from proposals submitted by dozens of institutions around the country. There is precedent for holding two commission debates. Four years ago, one commission debate was canceled because President Clinton had a scheduling conflict. Still, even those close to Mr. Bush were hard-pressed to view the counterdebates as even a partial victory. Days after the plan was announced, the campaign began running a commercial criticizing Mr. Gore for not accepting the plan, which failed to move the vice president from his dismissal of the Bush proposal. And privately, some Democrats said today that they believed that the Republicans' ability to bargain over the debates was diminished by Mr. Bush's abortive plan."]

For those of us involved in athletics, and especially with youth sports, \u201cone in a million\u201d also refers to a person who actually achieves the dream of becoming a professional athlete. The biblical passage \u201cfor many are invited, but few are chosen\u201d has wide application. It is especially relevant to the millions who, despite family connections, hours of training and private tutors, will not fulfill a childhood dream of being paid to play games. They will not become that one in a million. Anthony Mason did. Tributes to Mason, who died early Saturday at age 48, three weeks after being hospitalized with congestive heart failure, referred to his brawn and his toughness. The core of his being went much deeper. Mason, an undersize and overachieving power forward for 13 pro seasons with six teams, including the Knicks, possessed a tenacity that was embedded in his soul for as long as I can remember. That goes back to March 1983. After working in the Week in Review section of The New York Times, I came to sports just in time for the Public Schools Athletic League playoffs. There were a number of powerhouse teams and great players in the city that year."]

Mason, in his typically straightforward manner, expressed his unhappiness with coming off the bench as the sixth man. \u201cHe thought he should have been starting, and he probably should have been,\u201d Anderson told me in a 1994 interview as Mason and the Knicks were beginning their playoff run toward the N.B.A. finals. Shannon Greer, a senior who had been on the Springfield Gardens team longer than Mason, got the starting nod. Everyone acknowledged that Mason was the superior player, but he was an invaluable reserve, delivering a knockout blow from the bench. Ultimately, the Springfield Gardens players realized what every championship team and organization realizes: Everyone has a role. Someone has to be the headliner, someone has to be the face of a great story. It\u2019s no reflection on your worth as a human being if that person is not you. Everyone hoists the trophy. At the end of the day, what matters is how much you believe in yourself and how tenaciously you pursue your dream.

Also playing in the city at the time were Mark Jackson of Bishop Loughlin in Brooklyn, who went on to St. John\u2019s, where he had a spectacular career; Kenny Smith of Archbishop Molloy in Queens, who went to North Carolina, where he was equally spectacular; and Pearl Washington of Boys and Girls in Brooklyn, who was pretty spectacular at Syracuse. After his senior year, Mason went off to Tennessee State, and eventually \u2014 after stops in Turkey, the Continental Basketball Association and the United States Basketball League \u2014 joined Smith and Jackson in the N.B.A. Those who appeared to be ahead of Mason on his high school team saw their stars fade. Anderson, hindered by poor grades, accepted a scholarship to Lee College in Baytown, Tex. Two years later, he went to Texas Tech, but he gave up on his dream after one semester.

Hard currency reserves are estimated to be only about $12 billion, even with controls on the withdrawal of capital, and large debts are coming due. The central bank is printing cash for now, as the value of the currency drops, and a team of economists from the International Monetary Fund should be able to come up with a better analysis of the country\u2019s needs next week, Mr. Sheremeta said.

["world/europe", "\u201cStated simply, Ukraine is the economic equivalent of a failed state,\u201d said Robert J. Shapiro, co-founder and chairman of Sonecon, a private firm that advises American and foreign businesses, in a post for The Globalist, an online magazine. Ukraine\u2019s credit rating is worse than Greece\u2019s and large debts will soon come due, with some $15 billion in sovereign bonds maturing this year and another $15 billion in 2015. With a current account deficit equal to 8 percent of its gross domestic product, Ukraine cannot pay off and refinance those debts without large-scale aid \u2014 some $35 billion over two years, the new government says. Ukraine\u2019s vulnerabilities are enormous, partly a result of 23 years of mismanagement since independence from the Soviet Union, when early reforms were quickly jettisoned and the economy was distorted by corruption, favoritism, patronage and outright theft. That history damages Ukraine\u2019s efforts now to hold the country together against Russian pressure, because ethnic Russians and many Russian speakers, both in Crimea and in the industrial east, see Russia as more successful and attractive than Ukraine. Since 1991, Ukraine\u2019s economy has shrunk 30 percent while Russia\u2019s has grown 20 percent. And the connections of Russia and Ukraine keep Kiev in a subordinate position, subject to Russian economic and trade pressure. Take natural gas, which Georg Zachmann of Bruegel, an economic research institution, called \u201cUkraine\u2019s expensive addiction.\u201d Ukraine is dependent on Russia for 60 percent of its energy supplies, purchased at a price considerably higher than that paid by Russian natural gas customers in Western Europe."]
["world/europe", "Before the Orange Revolution of 2004, which shook Moscow, Ukraine paid about $100 per thousand cubic meters of Russian gas, Mr. Zachmann noted. On April 1, after Moscow ends a political discount, the price will again be roughly $400, while in Germany it is closer to $330. On Friday, Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-run natural gas company, warned Ukraine that it could cut off gas exports, as it did in 2009, if Kiev did not pay its debts that are now at $1.89 billion, said the company\u2019s chief executive, Alexei B. Miller. That threat aside, the answer, everyone agrees, is the politically fraught increase of domestic gas prices to market levels, or close to them, reducing the government\u2019s subsidy and encouraging other gas producers to invest. In 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund, the energy subsidies alone were 7.5 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the rough equivalent of the entire budget deficit \u2014 encouraging wasteful use. The fund is almost sure to repeat earlier demands for domestic gas prices to increase, and Mr. Sheremeta, the economy minister, said that the new government would simply have to do it. Officials will argue, he said, that higher gas bills are the price of freedom. \u201cWe had the option to choose to pay a lower price to Russia or to choose freedom,\u201d he said, then referred to the deaths of protesters at the Maidan. \u201cIf we paid so much for freedom, can\u2019t we find the money to pay more for gas?\u201d"]
["world/europe", "New American and European offers of loans are in part intended to soften the immediate blow to voters of economic reform and higher prices, especially in a country with a weak social welfare system. Some suggest charging sharply different prices for corporate and residential gas consumption. But the heavy industry of the east was built on cheap gas, and on the side deals that Gazprom made with friendly Ukrainian businessmen. Trade is the other obvious weapon Russia has to keep Ukraine unstable. About a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s trade is with Russia. Last week Russia banned pork imports from Ukraine, citing supposedly uncertain safety standards under the new government. Earlier this year, Moscow used tariffs to warn and penalize Ukrainian businessmen and oligarchs who favored the proposed trade and political accords with Europe. A disruption of that trade could be devastating for Ukraine\u2019s economy and stir further separatist feeling in the mostly Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine. Some analysts estimate that Ukraine needs about $3 billion to $4 billion before the May presidential vote and at least $15 billion this year. The European and American aid offers are intended to tide the new government over until what is expected to be an I.M.F. stabilization program and longer-term loan.

The World Series lasted 53 innings, and the Royals held the lead at the end of just 13. Yet they were always in control. A year and a half ago, it was easier to dismiss the Royals. They had nearly beaten San Francisco in the 2014 World Series \u2014 stranding the tying run on third base in Game 7 \u2014 but their charmed postseason had nearly died before it started, in a wild-card game they had barely survived."]
["sports/baseball", "Sure, the Royals were good, but perhaps they had also been lucky. Then, in 2015, the same thing happened. Facing elimination in Houston in Game 4 of their division series, down by four runs in the eighth inning, the Royals stormed back to win. That kind of repeated resilience is real. There should be nothing more we need to see from the Royals, who open their title defense \u2014 against the Mets, no less \u2014 at home on Sunday night. They have gone from possible fluke to possible dynasty. \u201cThey know they have a chance to get to three straight World Series and win back-to-back World Series,\u201d Royals Manager Ned Yost said in spring training. \u201cQuite frankly, they know they were 90 feet away from going for a three-peat this year. They\u2019re every bit as motivated to come back and do it again.\u201d The Royals did not do much to replace second baseman Ben Zobrist or right fielder Alex Rios, but Ian Kennedy takes over for Johnny Cueto in the rotation, and Joakim Soria assumes Ryan Madson\u2019s setup spot. At 24, Yordano Ventura could develop into an ace, and Yost believes the core position players \u2014 Hosmer, Lorenzo Cain, Mike Moustakas and Salvador Perez \u2014 will continue to grow. \u201cYou just see them getting better and better every year,\u201d Yost said. \u201cNone of those guys have reached their ceiling, even though they\u2019re experienced world champions now. They\u2019re such a special group because they really know when to have fun \u2014 but they know when to get after it, too, like no team I\u2019ve ever had before.\u201d"]

Catapulted by young talent \u2014 some of which had never before reached the majors \u2014 the Houston Astros, the Chicago Cubs and the Mets lifted themselves from losing records in 2014 to the postseason in 2015. The Twins seem capable of the same trick, especially if center fielder Byron Buxton, who hit just .209 in 46 games last season, and Byung-ho Park, a designated hitter signed from South Korea, have the same impact the slugger Miguel Sano did last summer. \u201cYou try to imagine how you envision your talent, and how it\u2019s going to play out in terms of being competitive and winning,\u201d Twins Manager Paul Molitor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about not so much getting to the playoffs as trying to continue to move forward and pushing in the right direction.\u201d The Twins are heading there, though their rotation may need a midseason reinforcement from the top pitching prospect Jose Berrios, who starred in Class AAA last season. The Detroit Tigers, as usual, left little to chance, restocking their last-place team with familiar names, including Jordan Zimmermann and Mike Pelfrey for the rotation, Justin Upton for left field and Francisco Rodriguez for the ninth inning. Age is always a concern for the Tigers, but Justin Verlander, at 33, could be an ace again. Over his final 11 starts last year, Verlander had a 2.12 E.R.A. while opponents hit just .194."]

Jordan Zimmermann doesn\u2019t have to be all-world. Miguel Cabrera doesn\u2019t have to hit 50 home runs. Everybody contributing as a team unit is going to determine our winning, not one guy being a superstar.\u201d The Cleveland Indians and the Chicago White Sox cannot be discounted in the Central, because both have strong rotations, at least at the top. The Indians will count on Corey Kluber, Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar, while the White Sox have three standout left-handers in Chris Sale, Jose Quintana and Carlos Rodon. Both teams struggled at the plate last season, though, and between them added only one elite hitter this winter: third baseman Todd Frazier, who joined the White Sox in a trade. The Indians are notoriously slow starters, and their star left fielder, Michael Brantley, will begin the season on the disabled list as he recovers from shoulder surgery. In the West division, the Astros and the Texas Rangers should again stage a spirited race, with both very likely to reach the playoffs. The Astros helped their bullpen by trading for Ken Giles, the former Philadelphia closer whose slider looks like the primary weapon of another Phillies and Astros relief star, Brad Lidge."]

Better health for right fielder George Springer and a full season of center fielder Carlos Gomez \u2014 who arrived in a trade last July \u2014 should also make the Astros more dangerous. As much as the Royals deserved their playoff victory last October, the Astros did make it awfully tough. That experience can only help. \u201cWas I O.K. with losing to the eventual champs?\u201d Manager A. J. Hinch said. \u201cIt was probably the best lesson we could give our team: We\u2019re good enough to compete with anybody on any given day.\u201d The Rangers, though, could say something similar. They nearly beat the Toronto Blue Jays in their five-game division series and should also benefit from the full-season production of their July acquisitions. The ace Cole Hamels and the revamped bullpen \u2014 with Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson \u2014 will make a big impact, and second baseman Rougned Odor could be the game\u2019s next major star. With Prince Fielder, Adrian Beltre and Ian Desmond, the Rangers should have enough power to at least win a wild-card berth. If Yu Darvish returns to stardom after Tommy John surgery, Texas will be tough to beat in a playoff series. Under the new general manager Jerry Dipoto, the Seattle Mariners should at least beat out Dipoto\u2019s old team, the Los Angeles Angels. The Mariners could be a surprise \u2014 Sleeper in Seattle? \u2014 if Dipoto\u2019s mini-makeover works.

But rising to the franchise\u2019s first playoff spot since 2001 seems just out of reach. The California teams \u2014 the Angels and the Oakland Athletics \u2014 seem likely to finish at the bottom, despite the presence of the game\u2019s best player (Angels center fielder Mike Trout) and the ace Sonny Gray in Oakland. The Angels seem thin in the rotation and at spots in their lineup, and while the A\u2019s are no pushovers, their history suggests that trading a star at peak value (in this case, Gray) will be a strong consideration. The A\u2019s did that last season with third baseman Josh Donaldson, who joined the Blue Jays, won the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award and carried the team to its first playoff appearance since 1993. The Blue Jays lost their rental ace, David Price, but retain almost everyone from an offense that scored 127 more runs than any other team last season. \u201cWhen you look around and see the kind of talent that we have, it makes winning very plausible, and you believe that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cNobody wants to be the weak link.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "There are few weak links in the Blue Jays\u2019 lineup, and the pitching staff is strong enough to make the most of the run support. The young starters Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez could be breakout stars in the rotation, with R. A. Dickey, Marco Estrada and J. A. Happ as stabilizers. Drew Storen adds to the bullpen depth as a setup man for Roberto Osuna. The Yankees ranked second to Toronto in runs last season, and while it is hard to trust their aging lineup to repeat that feat, it is not too far-fetched. Nobody would want to face the Yankees\u2019 relievers in October, but the starters need to do more to get them there. The Yankees\u2019 rotation included only one pitcher (C. C. Sabathia) who met the minimum requirement (162 innings) to qualify for the E.R.A. title last season, but with Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, Luis Severino and Nathan Eovaldi, the talent is there to contend. The Boston Red Sox have the motivation, the money and the prospects to add what they need at the trading deadline. But will their roster be strong enough for it to matter? The guess here is that David Ortiz will finish his career the way Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter did for the Yankees: without a playoff appearance. Price is a major upgrade atop the rotation, of course, and Craig Kimbrel arrives to secure the ninth inning. But with two of Boston\u2019s more promising arms now hurt \u2014 starter Eduardo Rodriguez with a knee injury and reliever Carson Smith with a muscle strain near his elbow \u2014 the rest of the staff looks underwhelming."]

["health", "Britain Gives Green Light for Embryo Cloning - The New York Times LONDON - Britain's House of Lords backed new government rules Monday to allow limited cloning of human embryos, turning a deaf ear to religious leaders from across the spectrum who had urged them to oppose the measures. Peers in parliament's upper chamber voted by 212 to 92 to allow research using stem cells to develop treatments for killer diseases such as leukemia, Parkinson's and cancer. Debate raged for seven hours but as MPs in the elected House of Commons passed the order by a majority of two to one late last year, it will now become law. Prime Minister Tony Blair argues the move would allow Britain to stay at the forefront of the booming biotechnology industry. But right-to-life groups and religious leaders see it as the first step down a slippery slope to full human cloning. Independent peer Lord Alton, a ``pro-life'' campaigner, released a letter from Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and Britain's Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, urging parliament to set aside the laws. Alton said the government was railroading the order through parliament without proper scrutiny and proposed a motion that would freeze the legislation until a special committee had heard exhaustive evidence from experts. ``It is precisely because we need to consider these things in detail that we shouldn't be stampeded into making decisions,'' he said."]
["health", "``There are many strong ethical and scientific arguments which may be deployed against cloning techniques but we are also strongly at variance with international opinion,'' he said. The European Parliament has urged Britain to stop its plans. Alton's amendment fell as the government bought off opponents by promising to allow a committee of experts to scrutinize the ethics and science of the issue as long as the House of Lords voted the order through on the night. Health minister Lord Hunt said Britain would legislate to ensure full human cloning never happened even though safeguards were already in place. DEVASTATING DISEASES Stem cells are master cells that can develop into different cell types such as blood, brain and bones. They offer the potential to treat diseases ranging from Parkinson's, diabetes and cancers to leukemia, hepatitis and stroke. ``The science is clear that this research has the potential to provide the answers for these diseases,'' Hunt said. ``The human embryo has a special status and we owe a measure of respect to the embryo. We also owe a measure of respect to the millions of people living with these devastating illnesses and the millions who are yet to show signs of them.'' The order changes the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act of 1990, extending the scope for research on stem cells from human embryos but leaving human cloning illegal. The leader of Britain's Catholics, Archbishop of Westminster Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, said stem cells could just as easily be obtained from adults as embryos."]
["health", "But scientists say stem cells from early embryos, less than one week old, offer the greatest potential for human benefit. Blair has courted controversy by strongly backing the technology."]
["well/eat", "Can You Develop Food Allergies at Any Age? - The New York Times Q. Can adults develop food allergies, such as allergies to peanuts? A. Yes. Preliminary data from a large, new national study that is currently under review suggests that nearly 52 percent of American adults with a reported food allergy developed one or more food allergies after age 18. An estimated 5 percent of adults in the United States have a food allergy, compared with about 8 percent of children. And while some children outgrow allergies \u2014 usually those to milk, eggs and wheat \u2014 many retain their allergies through adulthood. Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a food allergy researcher at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who led the national study, noted that at allergy meetings around the world, \u201cyou\u2019d hear more and more about adult-onset food allergy. But this was all anecdotal. That\u2019s the reason we did the study, to get the numbers behind how frequently.\u201d Last year, Dr. Gupta and colleagues from Northwestern and the AmeriSpeak unit of NORC at the University of Chicago surveyed 40,447 adults across the United States, recruited from a nationally representative sample. They found that shellfish was the most common food allergy among adults, affecting 3.9 percent of the population, followed by peanut allergies, at 2.4 percent, and tree nut allergies, at 1.9 percent. Peanut allergies typically develop during childhood, and children less commonly outgrow them than they do other food allergies. Peanut allergy appears to be equally prevalent among American adults and children."]
["well/eat", "It has been well established that kids develop allergies to the \u201ctop eight\u201d foods: milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. Most of the reactions in adults occur to the top eight foods as well, according to Dr. Sharon Chinthrajah, an assistant professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine and medical director of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research, which was involved in shaping the survey. That said, shellfish allergy is more common among adults than among children, as it tends to appear later in life. Several patterns have been observed that are unique to adults who develop new food allergies. One is called oral allergy syndrome, which occurs in a small percentage of adults who have seasonal allergies. It \u201cinvolves your body getting tricked,\u201d said Dr. Chinthrajah. She explained that some adults might have allergies to tree pollen, for example, and some of the tree proteins are similar to those in fruits and vegetables, \u201cso when your body eats the raw form of those foods, it thinks you\u2019re eating tree pollen.\u201d Birch tree pollen, for instance, bears similarities to proteins found in fruits like peaches, apples and cherries. The main symptom is typically an itchy mouth or throat. Interestingly, if the fruit is first processed or cooked in any way, it denatures the protein and does not produce the same reaction."]
["well/eat", "Many adults who develop a new food allergy wonder what caused it \u2014 the \u201cturn-on switch\u201d as Dr. Gupta calls it. Anecdotal reports suggest that pregnancy, for example, can trigger new allergies, leading some to hypothesize that a hormonal connection may be at play. Other patients report they noticed a new allergy after getting a viral infection. Still, it is not yet clear what causes a new reaction to a food after someone has eaten it for decades without incident. Importantly, an allergic reaction is not the same as a food intolerance. An allergic reaction is characterized by marked symptoms, such as itching, hives, swelling, trouble breathing or vomiting, within two hours of consuming the food in question. Symptoms that appear the next day may be characteristic of a food intolerance, which Dr. Chinthrajah said researchers do not yet understand as well as they understand food allergies. More severe allergic reactions may require epinephrine or a visit to the emergency department. But just because you have a reaction once doesn\u2019t mean you must completely remove a food from your diet, said Dr. Gupta. Instead, if you have concerns, seek an allergist to get tested."]
["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE LEGACY; A Father's Footsteps Echo Throughout a Son's Career - The New York Times As the thrill of his father's election to the presidency in 1988 began to fade a bit, George W. Bush began to wonder what it would mean for him. So he commissioned a secret report, asking one of his father's aides to write about what happens to the children of presidents. The 44-page report, ''All the Presidents' Children,'' was sobering: since the founding of the republic, some children had flourished because of bountiful new opportunities, while many others had been crushed by heightened expectations and scrutiny. For example, one of John Adams's sons, John Quincy Adams, also became president, but two other sons disintegrated into alcoholism. And of John Quincy Adams's sons, one thrived and another committed suicide. Mr. Bush, chilled by the implications of the report, ordered all extra copies destroyed, a longtime friend said. Yet simply by commissioning the report, he demonstrated an awareness of something he is usually loath to discuss: the manifold ways in which his life has been molded and prodded by his father's career and his family's legacy. One of the questions Mr. Bush is most sensitive about has to do with this inheritance: To what degree is he his own man? A look across his life suggests a fairly straightforward answer: almost everything he achieved, he did in part because of his name and family connections. Typically, his name opened doors that would otherwise have been closed, but once inside he impressed people with his energy and enthusiasm."]
["us", "If it were not for his background, Mr. Bush very likely would not have gotten into Yale, would not have become a baseball team owner, would not have become governor of Texas -- and would not be a presidential candidate. Yet much the same was said of John F. Kennedy, and even Vice President Al Gore benefited enormously when he first ran for Congress by carrying the name of his father, a former senator. When one steps back from any stage of Mr. Bush's life and examines his biography as a whole, one theme runs through each stage of his life: hero worship of his father, leading to an instinct to follow his father's trail. Many friends think that at some level, a driving force of George W.'s career has been an effort to honor his legacy and please his father, or at least to emulate him. Some acquaintances, though not all, even believe that this year's presidential bid is a culmination of that quest. ''What makes him tick?'' asked an old friend of both Bushes. ''It's Daddy.'' ''Daddy allows him to do things and achieve ambitions that he would not do on his own,'' the friend added. ''Daddy is the motivation -- to please his dad.'' Yet his father's experience also taught Mr. Bush lessons about what to avoid, and in some respects he is campaigning this year as the anti-Dad. His campaign organization has a beyond-the-Beltway, down-home-Texan feel to it that his father's did not. It is led by old Texas buddies who, at least until recently, have run a disciplined and virtually leak-proof organization that is the opposite of President Bush's 1992 campaign, dominated by Washington politicos."]
["us", "Moreover, for all his father's efforts to enjoy pork rinds and boycott broccoli, Mr. Bush has a far more natural Bubba quality. More than his father, he genuinely seems delighted by the chance to work crowds. Mr. Bush comes across as by nature remarkably cheerful, relaxed and free of neurosis or inner conflict. But one exception creates a fascinating knot in the grain: his complex relationship with his father and his family legacy. As his brother Jeb once observed, growing up in the shade of a prominent father can create ''all sorts of pathologies.'' Powerful Role Models Diane Paul was a serious girlfriend of Mr. Bush when he was in his mid-20's. She speaks very fondly of him, which is no surprise: Mr. Bush seems to be regarded more warmly by his ex-girlfriends than many men are by their wives. Ms. Paul says that that even during the period Mr. Bush has called his ''nomadic years,'' when he was partying aggressively and avoiding anything that hinted of a responsible career, he was casting about for a way to live up to his family. She remembers his speaking of his father and grandfather with such awe that she knew they were powerful role models. ''The whole way he talked about his father and grandfather, it's no accident that he tried to repeat just what his dad did, in the same order,'' Ms. Paul said. ''It's what I thought his goal was. His goal was to see how he could step into those shoes, how he could live up to that family legacy. It was in his bones.''"]
["us", "''I think George at that time had more of an intensity than people realized about living up to his legacy,'' Ms. Paul added. ''That was the psychological tension in him: how am I going to live up to this?'' One result of this tension is that he has spent most of his life traipsing along the same trail his father had already blazed -- yet leaving much smaller footprints. Young George followed his father to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and then to college at Yale, with worse grades and less memorable achievements at both. Based on his mediocre high school grades (he never made the honor roll even one term, unlike 110 boys in his class) and college boards (which totaled 1206, compared with an average of 1386 for his classmates in the Yale class of 1968), it is difficult to see how he could have gotten into Yale if his father and grandfather had not attended before him. Like his father, he entered and became president of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, was tapped into the Skull and Bones secret society and became a fighter pilot. But while his father had been a much decorated combat pilot in World War II, George W. avoided service in Vietnam by piloting obsolete fighter planes in Texas."]
["us", "After leaving the Air National Guard, George W. began a business career just as his father had: by driving to Midland, Tex., and starting an oil business with a name that would not get lost in the phone book. (His father chose Zapata, around the end of the listings, and he chose Arbusto, near the beginning.) His father made millions of dollars, while George W. lost millions. And the son had the opportunity to lose millions only because of his name: for investors, he tapped relatives and family friends. Finally, both began political careers with a run for Congress while in their 30's. Both lost, but the elder George ran such a strong race that he retained his political credibility, while young George emerged simply as, well, a loser. In short, George W.'s career was not a precise copy of his father's but rather -- until a sudden flowering in the last decade -- a poor-quality carbon. It was only when Mr. Bush was in his early 40's that his life took on a new direction, and this seemed to empower him. ''The conventional wisdom on George is that the turning point of his life was giving up drinking,'' noted Roland W. Betts, a friend since Yale days and a partner in the purchase of the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989. ''I don't believe that. The turning point of his life was buying the Texas Rangers, succeeding with the Texas Rangers."]
["us", "''The reason is that it was the first real deviation from the script, which was his father's life. He had tried to emulate everything his father had done.'' With baseball, Mr. Betts said, Mr. Bush not only tackled something his father had not done but did it very well. The son helped turn the Rangers around and presided over the construction of a grand new stadium, one of the best in major league baseball. A Path Made for Frustration This pattern of following Dad's footsteps strikes almost everyone who knows the family. ''I'm sure there was something subconscious,'' mused Donald B. Ensenat, a fraternity brother, sometime roommate and longtime friend. ''It was never sitting down and saying, 'I'm going to follow my dad's career path.' But whoever your dad is, he's your first and most powerful role model.'' George W. Bush is unconvinced by this analysis. Asked if this pattern of similar behavior was a coincidence, he shifted uncomfortably in his chair. ''I don't know,'' he answered. ''You could write anything you want. I haven't spent a lot of time psychoanalyzing myself.'' This attitude mimics his father's famous discomfort with any probing of his psyche. Friends and family members say the entire Bush family is exceptionally averse to introspection, in part because of an ingrained notion that excessive reflection is wimpish and also because of a fear that journalists will pounce on any self-searching and exaggerate any vulnerabilities it reveals."]
["us", "One natural tactic for a young adult caught in the shadow of a powerful parent would be to flee it. The elder George Bush had escaped from his own powerful family by moving to Texas after graduating from college. And Jeb had set out in a new direction by majoring in Latin American studies in college, marrying a Mexican woman and working for a time as a banker in Venezuela, although in the end he, too, followed his father into politics, eventually being elected governor of Florida. George W., instead of fleeing that shade as Jeb did, embraced it -- and after college followed his father's route almost precisely. Yet this was a path tailor-made for frustration and disappointment: the elder George Bush enjoyed a career in the spotlight -- member of Congress, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, envoy to China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency -- while young George floundered, going nowhere. But what shines through in speaking to Mr. Bush's oldest acquaintances is the deep respect he has always felt for his father. Even in 1969, the year of Woodstock, when young George was 23 and the generation gap was as great as it has ever been in America, he wrote his parents a warm thank-you note and added about his siblings: ''Someday Jeb, and Neil, Marvin, and Doro will know how lucky they are -- someday they'll know what it is to be surrounded by love.''"]
["us", "His father wrote one of his staff members about how warm that made him and Barbara feel: ''We wiped back our tears and we said, 'We are very lucky to have a boy today who understands.' '' Some acquaintances believe that Mr. Bush's political career arose from a desire to avenge his father's defeat, although Mr. Bush dismisses the idea. In any case, the interplay between father and son is a constant backdrop to the presidential contest. The younger Mr. Bush is very sensitive to suggestions that he is a princeling, and as a result keeps his father largely out of sight. But they speak often and remain very close, and the father remains a vast if barely seen presence hovering over the son's campaign. Yet although they have a very trusting and mutually respectful relationship, father and son always remained separated by a generational divide. They were loving but not exactly best buddies. ''Dad was shy,'' young George told an interviewer in 1992, before he entered politics and became careful of everything he said. ''We never had 'the talk,' '' he said, and with regard to the use of a condom he added, ''He never told me to wear a 'raincoat' or anything.'' In some respects, friends say, Mr. Bush was closer to his mother, Barbara, and she was an equally powerful but very different force in molding the family. The father and grandfather were grand figures but also a bit remote, while Barbara, the disciplinarian, inspired less reverence and more fear."]
["us", "''It was really Barbara who raised them all,'' noted Elsie Walker, a cousin. ''Big George was really busy in that time. So she was the one who lived with the day-to-day anguish -- 'Where are your socks?'  'Clean the bathroom,' that kind of thing.'' George W.'s looks come from his father, but his personality resembles his mother's. He shares her impetuousness, her dismissiveness of critics, and above all her rapier wit. Nothing is so central to Mr. Bush's style as his needling humor, his tendency to see just about everybody as a jousting partner, and all that borrows from his mother. Friends remember that George was much more likely to quarrel with his mother than with his father, and he was less likely to speak worshipfully of his mother as a role model. But he did often speak of her with deep affection, and perhaps it is telling that he ended up marrying somebody a good deal like his mother: a strong and intelligent woman who nonetheless chose not to pursue a career after marriage. A decade before he married Laura Welch in 1977, he had almost married another woman. And while human motivations are always complex, some friends believe that earlier engagement was telling. His father had become engaged to Barbara Pierce at the age of 20, and they had lived off campus while the elder George studied at Yale. A generation later, when young George was a 20-year-old junior at Yale, he, too, fell in love: achingly, passionately, irrationally, buy-a-diamond-right-away in love."]
["us", "So, one rainy winter night in Houston over Christmas vacation from Yale, a childhood friend named Doug Hannah drove George W. to Neiman-Marcus. Mr. Bush darted into the store and emerged soon afterward bearing a large diamond ring to give his beloved. ''I was impressed,'' Mr. Hannah recalled. ''But the whole thing seemed ill conceived to me.'' And to just about everybody else. Mr. Bush had been dating the woman, Cathy Wolfman, for only a short period, and his roommates at Yale were stunned when he returned from Christmas vacation with the news. ''He came back,'' recalled Clay Johnson, then a roommate, ''and said, 'Guess what, guys? I got engaged.' '' In explaining how it came to pass, some friends turn not just to the obvious motivations -- Ms. Wolfman was a catch, a former high school cheerleader and now an excellent student at Rice University -- but also to some inner drive to follow the example set by his father, in love as in almost everything else. Another explanation is simply that Mr. Bush was famously impetuous, even rash, in making decisions. Whatever the logic, the couple kept delaying the wedding date and finally called off the engagement. ''It was postponed, and then it gradually died,'' Ms. Wolfman recalled. ''We weren't in the same city, and we just drifted apart.'' Friends had the impression that Mr. Bush was more in love with Ms. Wolfman than she with him, and he seemed hurt when they decisively split up after graduation and she moved to Washington. Within a year, she had married a young man who had just graduated from Harvard Business School."]
["us", "Mr. Bush took it very hard. Once more, he had come close to emulating his father's storybook life, but again he had fallen short. Initially reticent when the topic of the engagement came up in an interview, Mr. Bush later acknowledged that it had been a very difficult time. ''I asked Cathy Wolfman to marry me,'' he said. ''I struggled with the decision. There was a conflict there. I think both of us realized that it wasn't the right thing. And she went off and married another man, which was fine. But there was a conflict there. You can imagine what it was like to think you wanted to get married and then both of us decided not to.'' 'You Have Disappointed Me' The Bush clan gets together each year at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Me., and in each generation there is a star around whom others revolve. ''At Kennebunkport with his family, you could see that George Senior was the one they would cluster around,'' recalled Ms. Paul, George W.'s former girlfriend. ''His brothers were all successful, but George's father was the one they would gather around and look up to. I think George wanted to be like that in his generation. I think he felt competitive with his brothers.'' Others echo the comment, emphasizing that while the Bushes are held together by tremendous affection and mutual support, there is also a good deal of rivalry in the mix. When George W. was playing tennis with his brother Marvin at Kennebunkport more than a dozen years ago, Marvin began to goad his brother about being behind -- until George W. charged across the court at his brother and chased him up the fence."]
["us", "One of the few major parental reproaches that anyone can remember occurred during George W.'s college years, when he quit a summer job on an oil rig a week early so he could party with his friends in Houston. His father immediately summoned him to his office in Houston and lectured him. ''Son, you agreed to work a certain amount of time, and you didn't,'' young George later remembered his father saying. ''I just want you to know that you have disappointed me.'' Young George was left to stew in his own guilt. Two hours later, his father called him again to signal forgiveness and invite him to an Astros baseball game, but the reproach left a mark. ''Those were the sternest words to me, even though he said them in a very calm way,'' George W. later recalled. ''He wasn't screaming and he wasn't angry, but he was disappointed. When you love a person and he loves you, those are the harshest words someone can utter. I left that office realizing I had made a mistake.'' Another family clash came in the spring of 1973, George W. recalled, when he was visiting his parents in Washington, where big George was chairman of the Republican National Committee and defending the Nixon presidency in the midst of revelations about the Watergate scandal. Young George drove after drinking too much and, with his brother Marvin in the car, he slammed into a neighbor's garbage can and drove down the street with the can still caught under the car, creating a ruckus."]
["us", "His father, angry, asked to see George immediately in the den. And George marched in and challenged his father, asking if he wanted to go ''mano a mano.'' The confrontation was quickly defused, and while it underscored young George's combustibility and fondness for alcohol, it was not typical of the family dynamic. Politics or Baseball? The ''All the Presidents' Children'' report, written by a White House aide named Doug Wead, warned that being the first son was ''not going to be easy,'' but it suggested that history pointed to one career path in particular. ''Curiously,'' the report declared, ''politics is one of the least criticized professions for a President's children. Get a job as a journalist, and people will say it was the contact. Get elected to Congress and you are 'on your own.' '' The report added: ''Historically, there are three dynamics present when a President's offspring launches a successful political career. ''1.) The Presidency must be viewed as successful, or, at least, as not unsuccessful. ''2.) The family must appear united behind the decision. ''3.) The career should be launched quickly, even while the President is in office.'' That logic suggested Mr. Bush should move quickly into politics, and he thought about running for office in Texas in 1990."]

So if that's what you're going to do, you owe it to me to tell me, because then I'm not going to do this.'' Somewhat later, Mr. Betts recalled, Mr. Bush promised that he would not run for office in 1990. Instead, he turned his focus on the Rangers, and on blazing his own trail to elective office. He quickly realized that by deviating from his father's route and going into baseball, he had gained credibility.

["world", "A NATION CHALLENGED: STRATEGIC RELATIONS; Russia and U.S. Optimistic on Defense Issues - The New York Times Russia and the United States signaled tonight that they were near a breakthrough on the key strategic issues that had  divided the two countries since President Bush came into office, in particular Washington's plans to build missile defenses and Russia's troubled relations with an expanding NATO alliance. The progress was reported tonight after a meeting here between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and  Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov. A Russian diplomat said the meeting had created ''favorable conditions'' for ''forming a new framework for strategic relations'' between Moscow and Washington when Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin meet here on Sunday on the sidelines of a summit meeting of  Asian and Pacific leaders. The diplomat, quoted by the Russian Interfax news agency in a dispatch from Shanghai, said the meeting of the two leaders, to be followed by talks next month in Crawford, Tex., at President Bush's home,  ''would be of exceptional significance in this sense.'' The momentum in the strategic arms negotiations, stalemated for months after the two leaders opened them this summer at their first  meetings in Slovenia and Italy, follows Mr. Putin's announcement last month that he was opening Russian air space to the American airlift of military and relief cargoes to Central Asian republics for deployment on Afghanistan's northern frontier."]
["world", "Along with its support for the American military campaign in Afghanistan, Russia is offering its oil fields as a secure alternative to dependence on the turbulent Persian Gulf. [Page W1.] ''Not only is the cold war over,'' Secretary Powell said, ''the post-cold-war period is also over.'' Washington and Moscow now regard the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States as a watershed  event in international relations, a number of experts say, that has offered opportunities for Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush to battle a common enemy. This could generate a level of cooperation that allows Mr. Putin to overcome the objections of domestic critics who grumble that he is compromising Russian security by making concessions to Washington. Mr. Putin's strong support for American intervention in Central Asia allows Mr. Bush to promote a greater role for Russia in Western security. Neither side made public the details of any prospective agreement. But in recent days Secretary Powell  has underscored that Washington is now prepared to make the kind of cuts in its nuclear arsenal that Moscow has been seeking as a possible trade-off for amending the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Russia might also choose not to object to a testing program for missile defenses that  might otherwise be construed as a violation of that 1972 accord. The Bush administration's determination to build a missile defense shield has been a source of tension with Russia because such a shield violates the ABM treaty, regarded by Russia as the basis of all strategic arms control."]
["world", "A senior State Department official traveling with Secretary Powell said tonight that he would not go so far as to predict that Mr. Putin was ready to accept American proposals to modify the ABM treaty to allow extensive testing. But the official emphasized an ''across the board''  change in attitude by the Russian leadership toward cooperation on everything from strategic issues to fighting terrorism and closer relations between Russia and NATO. The American official said Russia's decisions this week to abandon a Soviet-era electronic eavesdropping base in Cuba and give up its lease on the Cam Ranh Bay naval base in Vietnam signified a change of thinking that went beyond the financial savings that both steps would yield for the Russian military. ''Clearly the Russians, in making these decisions for financial or whatever other reasons, do see this as a  new opportunity in a changed time,'' the official said, ''and it comes up  again when we talk about NATO-Russian cooperation.'' The official said NATO and Russian officials had stepped up their consultations in recent weeks to expand their cooperation, but he would not elaborate beyond saying that the cooperation did not include joint military action. Mr. Powell met Mr. Ivanov after a day of meetings with the foreign and trade ministers of the Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum. The ministers completed a statement condemning terrorism, though efforts by the United States to get a specific pledge of support for its military operations in Afghanistan foundered after Indonesia and Malaysia raised objections. Both have large Muslim populations. Secretary Powell declared that he was satisfied with the statement."]
["world", "''I got a resounding signal of support from all the members present,'' he said. Mr. Bush arrived this evening, and he and the secretary will meet Mr. Putin on Sunday after his talks with President Jiang Zemin on Friday. Mr. Putin's decision to align Russia with the fight against the bases of Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been hailed as a significant turn in Russia's post-cold-war policy toward the West. It has secured one immediate benefit for Russia: greater Western acceptance of the military campaign Mr. Putin is waging in the rebellious territory of Chechnya. The Russian leader characterizes the Chechnya campaign as Moscow's battle against terrorism by Islamic militants, some trained in Afghanistan. Though the Bush administration abruptly shifted its policy to acknowledge that terrorist groups had exploited the Chechnya conflict, the White House and State Department continue to admonish Mr. Putin to seek a political settlement there, and to hold accountable Russian military commanders who had presided over atrocities. Since last summer, Bush administration officials have been pressing Moscow not to put Washington in the position  of withdrawing from or violating the ABM accord. Such a step would probably incite renewed concerns in Europe and the Middle East that Mr. Bush was still pursuing a unilateralist course in foreign policy, and could undermine his coalition-building against terrorists. For his part, Secretary Powell said the terrorist attacks on the United States and its commitment to build a worldwide coalition against terrorist groups had ended any pretense of American unilateralism."]
["world", "''Nobody's calling us unilateral anymore,'' he said in remarks to American businessmen here. ''We're so multilateral it keeps me up 24  hours a day checking on everybody.''

["opinion", "Moving Beyond Stop-and-Frisk - The New York Times MY husband and I are about the same age and build, wear the same clothes and share the same gender, but I am far more likely to be stopped by the police. This isn\u2019t because I have a criminal record or engage in furtive movements. Nor is my husband a choirboy. Statistically speaking, it\u2019s because I\u2019m black and he\u2019s white. Even before Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the Federal District Court in Manhattan issued her courageous opinion in the two-month civil rights trial of Floyd v. City of New York on Monday, the numbers bore this out. Since 2004, the New York Police Department has stopped more than four million individuals, approximately 84 percent of whom have been black or Hispanic. In one recent year, stops of whites amounted to approximately 2.6 percent of the white population; in contrast, stops of blacks amounted to just over 21 percent of the black population. According to Jeffrey A. Fagan, a statistician at Columbia Law School who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be targeted than similarly situated whites, even after adjusting for precinct crime rates, racial demographics and other social and economic factors. For too many officers, male + black = reasonable suspicion."]
["opinion", "Judge Scheindlin has thus confirmed what many of us suspected all along. A large number of these stops and frisks failed to satisfy the minimal constitutional requirements that the Supreme Court put in place with its decision in Terry v. Ohio in 1968: for a stop, reasonable and articulable suspicion that a person is engaged in a crime, and for a frisk, reasonable and articulable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous. Even more important, Judge Scheindlin found that many stops were based almost entirely on race, in violation of the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection under the law, and that the city has long responded with deliberate indifference. But even if these practices were constitutional, they\u2019re still a bad idea. Of course, one wouldn\u2019t know that listening to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other true believers, who insist that aggressive stop-and-frisks have reduced violent crime. But they\u2019re wrong. The most obvious reason is the brute numbers. For every 100 individuals stopped and frisked, only about 6 are arrested, often for minor offenses like marijuana possession. The success rate for finding a gun borders on the nonexistent: 1 in every 1,000 stops. In fact, purely random stops have produced better results. For another thing, the government\u2019s reasoning is empirically suspect, and conflates correlation with causation. The homicide rate has been dropping during the time that stop-and-frisk has been policy. By its defenders\u2019 logic, stop-and-frisk works \u2014 even though there are many other reasons for the drop in homicides. Moreover, when the number of stops dropped by 20 percent last year, there should have been a corresponding rise in homicides. There wasn\u2019t."]
["opinion", "And there is a more important argument that isn\u2019t captured by the numbers. Aggressive stop-and-frisks sow community distrust of the police and actually inhibit crime control, creating a generation of disaffected minority youths who believe that cops are racists. Last, the pro-stop-and-frisk camp ignores the strategies other cities have employed to reduce crime without violating civil liberties, like \u201cfocused deterrence,\u201d which works with communities to go after the few individuals who are typically responsible for driving up crime rates. None of this means that stop-and-frisk should be junked. As Judge Scheindlin made clear, she is \u201cnot ordering an end\u201d to stop-and-frisks. She\u2019s ordering the police to follow the law. When my students ask, what should a cop do to \u201cfollow the law,\u201d I think back to Martin McFadden, the detective in Terry v. Ohio. Detective McFadden, a veteran of the Cleveland police, saw two men he thought were acting suspiciously. But he didn\u2019t immediately stop or frisk them. Instead, he took up a post to watch them. It soon became clear that the men were scoping out a location for a robbery. He watched as one man walked by the spot several times; he then watched the other go through the same motions. Only then, based on his belief that he had seen enough to think the men were \u201ccasing a job, a stickup,\u201d did he stop and frisk the men, finding two guns. That\u2019s reasonable suspicion. That\u2019s good police work."]
["opinion", "Instead, the New York Police Department has watered down the standard so that almost any black or Hispanic male can be deemed suspicious without need for further investigation. That means me. Now imagine if it meant you, too. That still leaves the question, \u201cWhat now?\u201d Mayor Bloomberg is sure to appeal Judge Scheindlin\u2019s decision, both in the court of appeals and the court of public opinion. But that\u2019s not the only option. He could actually welcome Judge Scheindlin\u2019s decision to appoint an independent monitor to supervise reform. Mr. Bloomberg already claims crime reduction as part of his legacy. It\u2019s not too late for him to claim that and more: that he reduced crime and finally did so in a way that was fair, egalitarian and not racially discriminatory. And it\u2019s certainly not too late for his successor. Just imagine what a legacy that would be. And not just for the mayor, but for New York City as well."]

["style/international", "A Start-Up Incubator With a Fashion Focus - The New York Times PARIS \u2014 The jewelry designer Sara Beltr\u00e1n owes part of her success to a Jaipur rickshaw taxi driver she met when on a business trip. From helping her find her house, to production and business contacts, he made the introductions. But a local connection can take you only so far. The Council of Fashion Designers of America is helping Ms. Beltr\u00e1n develop her jet-set beach-vibe brand Dezso into a profitable global enterprise with its in-house incubator program. The C.F.D.A., known for its charity fund-raising campaigns \u2014 particularly for HIV/AIDS research \u2014 and scholarships, introduced the incubator for emerging designers in 2009 as part of the initiatives of the mayor of New York at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg, to develop and retain entrepreneurs there. The original proposal was to partner with the Fashion Institute of Technology, but Lisa Smilor, the council\u2019s executive director, said she did not want to stake her organization\u2019s reputation on students fresh out of school. Instead, the C.F.D.A. set admission guidelines strictly to American designers who have established businesses at least two years old, and who have received notable press and orders from top-tier retailers. For its current class, the third generation, the council accepted 10 brands out of 35 applicants."]
["style/international", "After starting their business with $8,000 of personal funds and growing 30 percent annually over five years, Farah Malik and Dana Arbib, the designers of the jewelry brand A Peace Treaty, hit a wall. They were looking for an opportunity. The designers, who produce in 10 countries, had organized communities of older artisans to train younger generations in order to revitalize dying craftsmanship techniques, such as camel bone carving in Rajasthan. Ms. Malik said the kind of mentoring they had fostered was missing for their own business. Before the incubator, the C.F.D.A. already had a designer development program in partnership with Vogue magazine, which has been responsible for launching such designers as Rodarte, Proenza Schouler and Alexander Wang. However the organization\u2019s proprietary incubator is more of a slow cooker for young brands rather than the fast-paced cutthroat competition of the C.F.D.A./Vogue Fashion Fund, which is filmed as a Project Runway-like reality show. Ms. Smilor describes the incubator program as less marketing for the organization and more \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of supporting emerging designers. \u201cThe concept was to create a space where we can help nurture designers,\u201d she said. After applying to the C.F.D.A./Vogue Fashion Fund and making it through the first round, the designers of A Peace Treaty ultimately decided it was not right for the brand. Ms. Malik said they decided to focus on a \u201csure shot that would be more lucrative.\u201d A friend and incubator designer Jonathan Simkhai suggested they apply to the two-year program."]
["style/international", "The C.F.D.A. underwrites half the cost of a studio in a collective workspace in the heart of New York\u2019s garment district, which Ms. Malik likens to being on a school campus. Before moving into their studio at the incubator, she said, the designers were \u201cisolated\u201d in their Midtown Manhattan office. \u201cThe excitement and creativity buzzes with us all there,\u201d Ms. Malik said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re all struggling with the same business issues. That kind of sharing is really reassuring. We crack a lot of codes together.\u201d Ms. Smilor said that for 10 brands competing for the same investment dollars and editorial attention, the incubator is more of a community than a competition for the fellows. \u201cThey really are all for one and one for all,\u201d she said. In the first part of the two-year program, designers selected for the incubator get an intensive eight-month business finance and marketing education as part of the C.F.D.A.'s partnership with Stern School of Business at New York University. Because the designers have established businesses, their brands also act as a case study project for the M.B.A. students, who work with the designers to develop business plans that include e-commerce and finance strategies. Having the tough love of aspiring business sharks pick apart and critique her business was sometimes uncomfortable for Ms. Malik. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very proud about building our business ourselves from the ground up,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it felt too big and I had to negotiate my feelings around the program. But it was the best treatment we could have gotten.\u201d"]
["style/international", "Beyond the textbook education of running a business, Ms. Beltr\u00e1n said the value of the incubator for her was also the introduction of work discipline. \u201cI was dying to have routine,\u201d she said in Paris during the recent fashion season. \u201cI needed to have a more formal business structure.\u201d Integrating the M.B.A. students and designers has a marked effect on the designers\u2019 language when they talk about their lines now. Ms. Malik refers to her brand\u2019s \u201cDNA\u201d when discussing A Peace Treaty\u2019s identity, which she describes as \u201cglobal ethnic modern for the contemporary girl.\u201d Ms. Beltr\u00e1n also uses the same term when talking about Dezso\u2019s look. Before joining the incubator, Ms. Beltr\u00e1n knew her company from every angle, but talking about it in a business pitch was stressful for her. That new business language also prepares the designers to present themselves and their brands to potential investors and executives, such as in a recent presentation to Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive of LVMH Fashion Group. Throughout their residency, industry executives are assigned to incubator fellows as mentors to help them identify personal challenges and guide them in developing their businesses. Shira Sue Carmi, a fashion business consultant, is acting as a mentor and helping Ms. Beltr\u00e1n streamline Dezso and transition the brand from a casual summer line, which in early designs used materials like leather and sharks\u2019 teeth cast in rose gold, to the high-end luxury market. Mexican bracelets from her first collection retail starting at about $100, and more recent pieces with semi-precious stones retail for up to $95,000."]
["style/international", "The C.F.D.A. not only wants to elevate designers\u2019 business operations while in the incubator, but also foster their creativity to continue developing their lines. Through partnerships, designers are granted allowances for travel and funding for business projects. Ms. Beltr\u00e1n, for example, will shoot a video lookbook in Puerto Rico. A Peace Treaty will travel to Colombia for inspiration for their coming collections. As the C.F.D.A. prepares to start taking applications in spring for the next generation, Ms. Smilor said it was exploring the possibility of creating a showroom for the designers. The business development and skills the designers receive in the incubator are fueling more than just their existing brands. \u201cThe idea is that when I leave the incubator everything is under control so that I can take the next step,\u201d Ms. Beltr\u00e1n said. \u201cBut I cannot do just jewelry.

["sports", "A lot of people came to the funeral. Everybody said, \u201cGanbareyo\u201d [try your best] or \u201cSupport your mother and sister.\u201d I felt pressure every time I heard these words. The reality is that I lost my beloved father. I have a responsibility to carry on for my father. I was ready to be crushed by the pressure. Because of a letter from my homeroom teacher, or encouragement from neighbors and friends, I managed to overcome the pressure. I made myself a promise. \u201cOK, I can do it.\u201d When I questioned what I could do, I answered quickly. That was basketball, a game my father enthusiastically watched. He had been watched me play since I played mini basketball and was always there at my tournaments. Having him watch me was like being tickled; I felt happier. I believe that my father will keep watching me from the sky, so I reaffirmed my commitment to playing basketball. I returned to practice 10 days after the tsunami. My teammates quietly welcomed me. Without any words, I felt that the passes they threw me were their way of telling me that you are not alone, we are with you. The bond with my teammates was intertwined with the trajectory of each pass. I wiped away sweat and tears as I ran up and down the court."]
["sports", "I realized again the pleasure of playing basketball. More than anything, I felt deeply the importance of my teammates and how wonderful they were. Basketball is a game played by five people. If one of them is absent, the team can\u2019t play well. Each player is under heavy pressure. Everybody shares the pleasure when winning and the frustration when losing. That\u2019s why we practice over and over every day. Since then, I have devoted myself even more fully to basketball. In \u201cSlam Dunk\u201d [a Japanese comic about high school basketball], my bible, Anzai sensei said that if you give up, the game is over. This phrase has become my motto. The phrase not only applies to basketball, but also our life. Actually, when I was almost crushed by the pressure, this phrase pushed me to move forward. There will be some times that I may give up when facing a wall playing basketball or in my life. At such times, not giving up, instead of turning back, I will look to the sky. I\u2019d love to move forward a long path of life step by step for my father\u2019s sake. My dream is to become a teacher. I think they have a role to convey many messages to students. I experienced sadness and pain as a result of the disaster, and I learned something. That life is precious, important, and how wonderful and delightful it is that you are alive."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE BUSH CANDIDACY; G.O.P. Leaders Fret at Lapses In Bush's Race - The New York Times Prominent Republicans around the country, including several who advise Gov. George W. Bush, say they are worried that his candidacy has floundered in recent weeks, allowing Vice President Al Gore to build on his velocity from the Democratic convention in a way that they never expected. While none of these Republicans expressed panic and all said that Mr. Bush could reverse the trend, they acknowledged puzzlement, frustration and even some distress about the strides that Mr. Gore has made, a degree of progress that they said went beyond an inevitable tightening in polls. ''There's no doubt about it: There's real worry about the general state of things,'' said William J. Bennett, the former secretary of education, who has advised Mr. Bush from time to time. ''There's nervousness that was not there before.'' In interviews during the past several days, leading Republicans on Capitol Hill, at state capitals and even at the Bush headquarters in Austin, Tex., raised concerns beyond poll numbers. Many of them expressed unease about the way Mr. Bush has handled himself, saying that in the last two and a half weeks there had been too many instances when he seemed either defensive, bumbling, weary, detached or peevish. And there have been too many missteps, several Republicans said. For starters, some cited Mr. Bush's refusal to go along with the debate schedule proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, saying his reluctance had made him look timid and was diverting attention from issues that he would be better off discussing."]
["us", "Others said Mr. Bush was letting himself get dragged too deep by Mr. Gore into the bogs of a policy debate, where the vice president is at his best. Still others said that Mr. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney as a running mate had produced scant excitement on the campaign trail but significant damage in the news media, manifest in weeks of questions about the financial details of Mr. Cheney's retirement package from Halliburton, the energy services company he served as chief executive. Several Republican officials said they had serious reservations about the party's tongue-in-cheek TV commercial broadcast last week that challenged Mr. Gore's truthfulness and political consistency. Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the campaign was too preoccupied with trying to make everyone happy and not delivering a clear message. ''The biggest mistake we can make is to try to be all things to all people,'' he said. ''We have to be very aggressive and not engage in any reticence about our philosophy or our positions.'' Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, dismissed the worries about the state of the governor's candidacy, so dominant for most of the year. ''Everybody wants to win in a landslide,'' he said. ''Landslides are rare. We've always known and said this was going to be a close race.''"]
["us", "Indeed, to some Republicans, Mr. Bush began the process of correcting his campaign this week. On Tuesday, he moved aggressively to neutralize Mr. Gore's advantage on the critical issue of health care by releasing his own plan to give prescription drug benefits to the elderly. And Mr. Bush has engaged Mr. Gore much more forcefully in his comments and oratory. But Republicans said that the combination of Mr. Gore's surge and Mr. Bush's stumbles had made Mr. Gore, for perhaps the first time in the 2000 presidential race, the front runner. Many said they were unnerved by voter surveys showing that Mr. Gore -- who for months trailed in the polls -- had pulled even or ahead of Mr. Bush nationally and in some important states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Missouri, where campaign officials had long predicted victories. ''Everybody expected a bounce, but not nearly as much as this,'' said Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, referring to Mr. Gore. And, he said, it had significantly altered the mood of Republicans in his state, a crucial battleground. ''There is a lot of chatter at the grass-roots level about how they're scared of these new numbers,'' he said. ''This has shocked the system from what looked like a slam dunk.'' Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who has campaigned with Mr. Bush in his state for the past three days, said: ''I'm at a loss to explain the rather significant change in the polling numbers.''"]
["us", "While Mr. Ridge said he was confident Mr. Bush would recover, he said, ''We've got to go a little bit more on the offensive.'' He added of Mr. Gore, ''This guy's tough.'' In fact, in the nearly three weeks since the end of the Democratic convention, Mr. Gore has been constantly on the offensive. First he declared himself the candidate of the little guy and portrayed Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as beholden to big oil and drug companies; then he relentlessly attacked Mr. Bush over tax policy and health care. At the same time, Mr. Gore has managed to use the favorable attention he received during the convention -- even the much publicized kiss he planted on his wife, Tipper, before his acceptance speech -- to give life and personality to his stiff and uninteresting stereotype. A Republican official closely involved in the Bush campaign said that Mr. Bush's aides had readjusted their expectations for a spate of new polls that are to be released in the next few days. As recently as two weeks ago, the official said, Mr. Bush's aides were forecasting that these polls would show the race in a dead heat. But there was now a feeling inside the Bush camp that Mr. Gore might have, on average, a 3-to-5-point advantage, the official said. A Washington-based adviser to the Bush campaign said: ''Today, I think anybody forced to wager on the race would have to bet on Gore.''"]
["us", "An official of the Republican National Committee said, ''You're always on the defensive when your lead evaporates.'' In the interviews, Republicans of all ideological stripes were hardly unified in dispensing advice for Mr. Bush, or in gauging the health of his candidacy. Several said that Mr. Bush was merely being buffeted by cyclical forces, which might change several times again before Election Day. Others said that Mr. Bush's position on debates made at least as much sense to voters as Mr. Gore's. But some concerns about Mr. Bush's campaign were mentioned time and again. For example, several Republicans said that Mr. Bush still needed to be more aggressive in explaining his proposal for a tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years, more than double the size of the cut planned by Mr. Gore. ''People get very worried about that kind of a tax cut with the speculative nature of the surplus,'' said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Mr. Specter and other Republicans said it was a mistake for the Bush campaign to sign off on a Republican Party commercial that poked fun at Mr. Gore for appearing at a Buddhist temple fund-raiser. ''I don't think it's wise to do a 'tongue-in-cheek,' '' Mr. Specter said. ''It's got to be treated very seriously and in a factual way with no apologies -- but not tongue in cheek.'' Some people close to the campaign even said that Republican National Committee officials warned that the commercial was inappropriate because it moved the discourse away from issues."]
["us", "Mr. Cheney was also cited by many Republicans as a disappointing choice for Mr. Bush's running mate, especially compared with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who has helped energize the Democratic ticket. ''He can recover, but he's not gotten off the dime,'' Mr. Upton said of Mr. Cheney. ''The focus, rather than on his solid record of achievement, particularly as the secretary of defense, and then in the private sector, has been totally eclipsed by personal finances.'' Mr. Bennett put it this way: ''The Lieberman pick looks pretty solid. He's a happy camper out there.'' Some Republicans also said that despite his proposal for debates this week, Mr. Bush was unwise to make an issue of the format for his televised encounters with Mr. Gore. ''He is proposing debates that will arguably reach fewer people,'' said a Bush adviser. ''You can't sell a Chevy and say it's a Cadillac.'' In addition, several Republicans said, Mr. Bush has at times failed to muster the sunny geniality and bravado that have always been his strongest suits. He has fumbled with his mathematical figures and his words. In an interview late last week, at a time when he might be expected to be as pumped up by the gathering frenzy as ever, Mr. Bush instead grew prematurely reflective and slightly teary as he mulled over what he said was the greatness of American democracy."]
["us", "At a news conference on Sunday, as he showed snippets of videotape to support his accusation that Mr. Gore was backing out of an agreement to debate anytime and anywhere, he tapped his foot and occasionally pursed his lips. The next day, Mr. Bush, who prides himself on discipline, was caught uttering a vulgarity to describe a reporter into a microphone. While many political analysts said that the incident would cause no major damage, others said it could feed into perceptions of Mr. Bush as insufficiently experienced or mature for the task at hand. ''He's still a relative rookie at the national level,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a government professor at the University of Texas in Austin, ''and that's showing right now.'' Despite their concerns, some Republicans said that while they were sobered by the situation, they were not scared. ''There was a period right before and during the Republican convention where it looked like Bush would sail away with this,'' said Senator Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois. ''We've all come back to reality.'' Representative Joe Scarborough of Florida said: ''The campaign actually started yesterday in earnest. If Bush was going to have a problem, he picked the right time to have it.'' Bill Paxon, a former House member who is an adviser to the campaign, said Republicans who expected Mr. Bush to be ahead now were guilty of ''Alice in Wonderland'' thinking. ''I believe that it's going to be a tight race to the finish,'' he said. ''But I am as confident of victory as I was six month ago. George W. Bush is going to be the next president.''"]
["science", "Waking From Hibernation, the Hard Work of Spring Begins - The New York Times For animals that hibernate, making it to spring is no small feat. Torpor \u2014 the state of reduced bodily activity that occurs during hibernation \u2014 is not restful. By the time they emerge, hibernating animals are often sleep-deprived: Most expend huge bursts of energy to arouse themselves occasionally in the winter so their body temperatures don\u2019t dip too low. This back-and-forth is exhausting, and hibernators do it with little to no food and water. By winter\u2019s end, some have shed more than half their body weight. But just because it\u2019s spring doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to celebrate. Spring means getting ready for the full speed of summer \u2014 and after spending a season in slow motion, that requires some ramping up. Here\u2019s a look at what different animals have on the agenda after coming out of winter\u2019s slumber. Black bears emerge from their dens in April, but stay lethargic for weeks. During this so-called walking hibernation, they sleep plenty and don\u2019t roam very far. Though they have lost up to one-third of their body weight over winter, they don\u2019t have a huge appetite right away \u2014 their metabolism is not yet back to normal. They snack mostly on pussy willows and bunches of snow fleas. In January or February, some females give birth, typically to two or three cubs. New mothers continue to hibernate, but they go in and out of torpor, staying alert enough to respond to their cubs\u2019 cries. When they emerge from their dens, mama bears find trees with rough bark that her cubs can easily climb for safety."]
["science", "\u201cSlowly, the bears\u2019 metabolism gears up to normal, active levels,\u201d said Lynn Rogers, a bear expert and principal biologist at the Wildlife Research Institute, a nonprofit in Minnesota. \u201cWhen plants start sprouting on the forest floor, that\u2019s when they start really moving around.\u201d Though many insects go dormant over winter, honeybees don\u2019t turn off completely. They stay in their hives, clustered close around their queens, and shiver with their flight muscles to generate heat. Their only food source is the reserve of honey they built up over summer. When it gets warm, the first thing honeybees do is take flight and defecate all over the place. They don\u2019t want to soil their hives, so they\u2019ve been saving their waste all winter. Then they forage for fresh water. All the while, they\u2019re on alert for first signs of blooming flowers, when the pollen gathering begins. Fresh pollen prompts the queen to lay eggs, and provides an important protein source for young bees. This is a time of fierce competition between colonies, said Mehmet Ali Doke, a doctoral candidate at Pennsylvania State University who studies what honeybees do during the winter. \u201cThey will start getting into whatever they can \u2014 if you\u2019re having a coffee with six cubes of sugar and you left it out on your porch, they will get into that too.\u201d Fertilization happens a few days after females emerge from hibernation. After leaving their winter caves, they move to a large tree or another cave. \u201cThey want a warm, stable environment where they can develop their young,\u201d said Joy M. O\u2019Keefe, a bat expert and assistant professor at Indiana State University."]
["science", "Bats often return to the same maternity spot year after year, sometimes traveling hundreds of miles to get there. Dozens of mothers will congregate at these sites, cuddling to keep warm. When their pups are born, 50 to 60 days later, mothers may help each other by taking turns foraging for insects and roosting with the group. With no parenting responsibilities, and perhaps to avoid competing with the females, males will stay in torpor for longer \u2014 making their hibernation spaces real man caves in the spring. Arctic ground squirrels hibernate farther north than any other animal. They enter torpor in August or September, and stay in suspended animation underground for up to 270 days, reducing their metabolism by well over 90 percent to survive. To achieve this, males shrink their testes and stop testosterone production, which means they must experience puberty every spring. When they awaken in mid-March, they live off a cache of seeds, berries, mushrooms and willow leaves while sexually maturing and bulking up. When they surface in mid-April, the world outside is still covered in snow and temperatures can be as low as minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. But the males are charged up. For two weeks, testosterone will surge through their bodies and impel them to storm the tundra, competing with other males for mates, sometimes to the death."]
["science", "The females spend just a day warming up before surfacing. On average, a female gets impregnated just two days after ending her hibernation. Males approach her, greasy with hormone secretions, and she fends them off for up to a day to test their endurance.

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS SIMILARITY; Once Before, Bush Balked at Debating - The New York Times His Democratic opponent needled George W. Bush for months about being ''afraid'' to debate. The opponent said he would debate the Texas governor any time, anywhere. Mr. Bush hemmed and hawed. When the governor finally agreed to debate, his opponent accused him of trying to dictate terms that would reduce the size of the audience. If the plot sounds as if it had been lifted from the debate squabbles between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, think again. The Democratic opponent in question was Garry Mauro, and the election was the 1998 governor's race in Texas. ''Bush's position was he'd do it when the time was right,'' recalled Mr. Mauro, who is a chairman of Mr. Gore's Texas campaign. ''And the time was never right.'' Mr. Bush's aides now say that the governor always intended to debate -- a point that seemed less clear in 1998 -- and agreed to a single event late in the race when voters would be paying attention. But Mr. Bush did so only after his campaign was allowed to control when, where and how the debate was conducted, choosing the most remote city in Texas on a night when many people were attending high school football games. His staff also dictated the format, ruling out questions from an audience or Capitol reporters in favor of a single moderator, and declining a large auditorium for a small television studio."]
["us", "To some degree, Mr. Bush was simply playing the role of a popular incumbent reluctant to share a stage with a long-shot challenger. Despite leading in some polls by more than 50 percentage points, Mr. Bush exhibited the same caution toward debating that he does today, an approach that some now regard as a missed opportunity. Before the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush had participated in only two major debates, against Mr. Mauro in 1998 and against then-Gov. Ann Richards in 1994. ''I thought it was curious that he didn't take advantage of this to prepare for the presidential race,'' said Richard Murray, a University of Houston political science professor, of the 1998 race. ''Mauro would have been a good sparring partner.'' Few people believed Mr. Mauro, a former Texas land commissioner, had any chance of unseating Mr. Bush. With little money for advertising, Mr. Mauro had pushed for debates, even accepting an invitation from a radio station to debate the governor inside the ball park of the Texas Rangers, the baseball team once run by Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush had rejected invitations from many organizations before he agreed to a debate in El Paso, sponsored primarily by the local newspaper, that would be held about three weeks before Election Day. ''The argument that we pushed was that if the governor planned to run for president, it would benefit him to have more than one debate under his belt,'' said Robert Moore, managing editor of The El Paso Times, who had courted the Bush campaign for several months."]
["us", "Mr. Mauro accused Mr. Bush of trying to orchestrate a debate that no one would watch. El Paso, he noted, was the only city in Texas in the mountain time zone. And by picking a Friday night roughly three weeks before Election Day, Mr. Bush had chosen a time that conflicted with high school football, an ardent passion across Texas. Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governor chose El Paso because it had never been the site of a gubernatorial debate, and he wanted to emphasize the importance of voters in West Texas. Mr. Moore said the Bush campaign made several demands. First, he said, they rejected the format used in the lieutenant governor's debate, in which the candidates were asked questions by members of the audience, by a panel of journalists and then by each other. Instead, the Bush campaign insisted on a single moderator and asked Mr. Moore to fill that role. Mr. Moore  said the campaign insisted that the two candidates be seated at an oval-shaped table with himself in the middle. ''I would serve as a buffer that might prevent personal attacks,'' said Mr. Moore, who insisted on free rein to ask questions on any topic as well as follow-ups. ''They wanted a very controlled environment for the debate.'' Mr. Mauro said the Bush campaign also required that the cameras only be allowed to focus on the moderator and whichever candidate was answering the question as a way of avoiding unguarded reaction shots.  Mr. Bartlett said any prohibitions on the cameras ''doesn't ring a bell with me.''"]

["sports/football", "N.F.L.\u2019s Forays to London Muddle Its Stance on Sports Betting - The New York Times LONDON \u2014  The N.F.L. has long opposed sports betting and has more recently declined to invest in, or officially embrace, the daily fantasy sports websites that have caught on with fans in the United States and blanketed game broadcasts with advertising. But in Britain, where sports betting is legal, and which is now host to three N.F.L. regular-season games a season, the line is, well, blurry. The N.F.L. signed a three-year deal that allows one of the major daily fantasy sports\u00a0companies, DraftKings, which has been deemed a gambling outfit here, to post advertisements at Wembley Stadium, where the games are played, but with a caveat. It can post its logo with each replay shown in the second quarter on the big\u00a0screens at Wembley, but not on signboards\u00a0near the field, so television viewers in the United States cannot see them. Likewise, the N.F.L. required that the sports betting machines at Wembley be turned off during games, but fans here Sunday happily placed bets from their seats on mobile phones or at a betting parlor near the grounds. DraftKings, which made the marketing push ahead of its plans to open for business in Britain in the near future, did win out on something more innocuous: It got a choice spot to hand out foam fingers with its logo to some of the 80,000-plus fans who made their way into the stadium."]
["sports/football", "The N.F.L., whose players and games form the backbone of the sites\u2019 virtual contests, has long walked a delicate line, at once trying to tap fantasy fans\u2019 rabid appetite for football while trying to keep an arm\u2019s length between itself and this unregulated industry, which is increasingly under scrutiny. Daily fantasy sports games are not considered gambling in the United States because of an exemption to a federal law. The exemption was pushed for by the N.F.L., which opposes gambling out of the fear that it could compromise real games. So the league is left with a seemingly contradictory posture that becomes particularly glaring as it tries to expand beyond the United States, into places like Britain, where sports betting is permitted. Daily fantasy\u2019s popularity has flourished as millions of people flock to sites in which users pay an entrance fee, draw up their own \u201croster\u201d of players for virtual contests, and win cash based on the actual performances of athletes on the field. In the United States, federal and state agencies have begun inquiries into the practices of daily fantasy websites, which are valued at more than $2 billion. The agencies want to know if players have been duped by aggressive solicitation or the use of insider information by employees of the sites. At the same time, lawmakers and some states see a resemblance to Internet gambling and are pushing to prohibit the games or regulate them."]
["sports/football", "The question of whether daily fantasy sports is gambling is settled in Britain: DraftKings had to get a gaming license to operate, a regulatory necessity that critics of the industry have seized upon. \u201cBy maintaining a gambling license in the U.K., DraftKings is directly admitting the obvious: Daily fantasy sports is gambling,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who has asked Congress to explore the relationship between fantasy sports and gambling. \u201cThe N.F.L.\u2019s acceptance of sports betting \u2014 as long as it isn\u2019t in the U.S. \u2014 is yet another example of the league engaging blatant hypocrisy by supporting and investing in fantasy sports betting while opposing sports betting at casinos and the tracks.\u201d Mr. Pallone and Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, intend to ask the Federal Trade Commission to investigate not only the practices of daily fantasy companies, but also any ties between the industry and professional sports leagues, players and employees of the leagues. \u201cIf employees of fantasy sports games should not be allowed to play the games due to the potential use of insider information, then certainly neither should those who actually run, catch, throw or kick the ball,\u201d Mr. Menendez said. The N.F.L. allows its players to participate in fantasy contests as long as the stakes do not exceed $250.

["health", "VITAL SIGNS: PROTECTION; Blue Shirt May Help Prevent Red Body - The New York Times Correction Appended The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology kicked off beach season with two studies on sunburn. One suggests  that a good way to avoid that red-all-over-look is to wear a T-shirt dyed blue. Researchers at the New York University medical school examined the protection against ultraviolet rays afforded by cotton shirts and how it can be enhanced. Repeated washings of a white shirt with water or detergent raised UV protection by about 50 percent as the cloth shrank. Use of a detergent additive called Tinosorb that makes fabrics into more effective barriers to UV light raised the shirt's score by 400 percent after washing. But the biggest gain, 544 percent, came from dyeing the shirt blue. Dr. David Polsky, a member of the research team, said different colors absorb light differently, so researchers wondered if a change of hue could greatly affect UV protection. In the second study, researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston went to the shore to look into why many people who used sunblock still managed to get burned. They interviewed 67 beachgoers at the end of a summer day. Of the 30 who had arrived without sunburn and used sunblock, 22 were going home burned. Of those, 20 said they had gone swimming and not reapplied the lotion after toweling off; the other two had stayed out of the water but had not reapplied sunblock despite spending more than four hours in the sun."]

["nyregion", "Two Who Arrived Minutes After Fatal Hudson Flight, and Avoided Death - The New York Times Paola Casali, 42, a tourist from Rome, was hoping to make a midday helicopter tour with her 13-year-old son, Lorenzo, from the West 30th Street heliport on Saturday, but she arrived shortly after the doomed helicopter had left. Two days earlier, she had called Liberty Helicopters to reserve seats on a tour for her and her son, and was told to be at the heliport on Saturday between noon and 1 p.m. \u201cWhen we arrived, there were no other passengers here,\u201d Ms. Casali said. As they waited for the next helicopter, word started to arrive that the previous one had collided with a small airplane and plunged into the Hudson. Ms. Casali, who is traveling alone with her son, said she felt that it was fate or some kind of divine intervention that had prevented them from making the ill-fated flight. \u201cI feel so confused, but I feel that we are so lucky,\u201d she said a few hours after the crash. Sitting outside the heliport by the Hudson River, she appeared stunned and reflective. \u201cToday begins a new life for me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is so strange is that this morning Lorenzo felt so nervous and did not want to fly today. He wanted to stay behind in a Starbucks but I said, \u2018No, no, no, this is completely safe,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said, adding that she had taken a similar helicopter tour in New York about six years ago."]

["world/middleeast", "Key Step in Checking Chemical-Arms Use Is Also Hardest - The New York Times The most important step in conclusively determining whether chemical weapons have been used is for independent experts to get prompt, unfettered access to the site of the suspected attack, according to Physicians for Human Rights, the American organization that was one of the first to document Iraq\u2019s use of poison gas against its Kurdish population in 1988. In the Syrian conflict, that step may also prove to be the most difficult, said Susannah Sirkin, a senior adviser at the organization in Cambridge, Mass. The areas where the weapons may have been used are hard to reach because of fighting and government restrictions on independent organizations that seek to enter the country. \u201cThat poses a challenge,\u201d she said, \u201cto anyone trying to assess what was delivered, whether or not it was chemical weapons, what it was, what injuries it has caused.\u201d On March 19, the Syrian government and Syrian rebels accused each other of having used chemical weapons in the northern province of Aleppo. Physicians for Human Rights called for immediate investigations by independent experts of all sites where the use of chemical weapons was alleged, and both the rebel groups and the Syrian government requested an independent United Nations investigation. Ms. Sirkin noted that the clock was ticking and that evidence could be deteriorating. Under ideal circumstances, she said, investigators would conduct full clinical exams of anyone injured or killed, and analyze blood, urine, soil, residue, clothing and any remains of weapons delivery systems, like munitions or cannisters."]
["world/middleeast", "\u201cThat usually is not going to happen because you\u2019re in a war,\u201d she said. If there is no direct access to the site, investigators try to gather as many interviews as possible from patients and other eyewitnesses. Intelligence agencies would look at what chemical weapons the players were known to possess. If the use of the weapons was confirmed, they would look, in trying to determine who used them, at factors like how they were delivered, which combatants had that capacity, and intelligence on what orders might have been issued. In a war environment, Ms. Sirkin said, there are many cases \u201cthat may look like chemical weapons, and legitimate observers, including medical observers, may legitimately believe that chemical weapons were used, and they may or may not have been.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to know unless you\u2019re an expert,\u201d she said. For example, a full six weeks aftrer Soviet forces used poison gas in an attack in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 1989, dozens of people were hospitalized with were what Physicians for Human Rights determined was \u201ccatastrophe reaction syndrome\u201d \u2014 symptoms brought on by fear after the use of poison has been reported. (The Soviets later confirmed and publicly acknowledged that they had used the agent chloropicrin.) Until a clear determination is made on whether chemical weapons were used, Ms. Sirkin said, \u201cit\u2019s important for everyone commenting on a situation to be as precise as possible.\u201d \u201cOne doesn\u2019t want to cause panic,\u201d she added."]
["world/middleeast", "On the other hand, she said, a small death toll or mild symptoms do not necessarily mean that banned weapons were not used, because there are many factors that affect their potency, including weather and volume. Determining what was used is important not only from a political and human rights point of view, but also from a public health standpoint, she said, so that appropriate care can be delivered. Everyone with access to a site should try to preserve anything that might be evidence, she said, because with chemical weapons used so infrequently, experts are still learning about new ways to detect them. Even without immediate direct access to a site, investigators can make headway, though they may not be able to make a final determination. Ms. Sirkin said her organization was surprised in the Iraq case by how much it could find out by interviewing people who had fled the scene and then returning years later to gather samples. She said she remembered being unable to enter Iraq in 1988 and wondering if the question of whether chemicals were used in the Kurdish areas would ever be answered. Physicians for Human Rights ended up surveying refugees who had fled to Turkey. Based on reported symptoms and people\u2019s descriptions of \u201cwhat they had seen, heard, smelled and felt,\u201d the group declared that it believed that mustard gas and a nerve agent had been used. Four years later, when the group reached the site, it found trace breakdown elements of the nerve agent sarin. \u201cWe had no idea that traces could remain four years later,\u201d she said."]

["well/live", "For Sore Throat, Xylitol and Probiotics Offer No Benefits Over Placebo - The New York Times Xylitol, a popular sweetener in sugarless gum, and probiotics are sometimes recommended as remedies for sore throat, but a randomized trial has found that neither works better than a placebo. Researchers assigned 1,009 people with sore throats to one of three groups: no chewing gum, xylitol gum, or sorbitol gum without xylitol. Half of each group was also given capsules containing either probiotics (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or a placebo. Patients recorded the number of pieces of gum and capsules they consumed daily and, using a seven-point scale, the degree of pain, swallowing difficulty and other symptoms they had each day. The study is in the Canadian Medical Journal. No matter how the researchers made comparisons \u2014 probiotic versus no probiotic; no gum versus sorbitol; no gum versus xylitol; xylitol versus sorbitol \u2014 they could find no difference in pain or swallowing problems between the groups. Even when they looked at subgroups \u2014 children 3 to 15, people over 15, people with high temperatures, people with various symptoms (tonsil swelling, cough, fever and others) \u2014 no differences appeared. Nor were there any differences between groups in number of days to return to normal activities or in recurrences of the sore throat. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing really,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Paul Little, a professor at the University of Southampton in England, \u201cbut once you have an established sore throat, xylitol and probiotics are not going to do any good.\u201d"]

["well/mind", "Heart Attack Survivors at Risk of Later Dementia - The New York Times Heart attack survivors have an increased risk for developing dementia, a new study has found. Danish researchers studied 314,911 heart attack patients and compared them with 1,573,193 controls who had not had a heart attack. They excluded anyone who had already been diagnosed with dementia or other memory disorders. The study, in Circulation, adjusted for heart failure, pulmonary disease, head trauma, kidney disease and many other variables. During 35 years of follow-up, there were 3,615 cases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, 2,034 cases of vascular dementia and 5,627 cases of other dementias among the heart attack patients. There was no association of heart attack with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But heart attack increased the risk for vascular dementia, the type caused by impaired blood flow to the brain, by 35 percent. There are several possible reasons for the link, including similar underlying causes for dementia and heart attack \u2014 among them, hypertension, stroke and having undergone coronary artery bypass surgery. The researchers had no data on smoking, and they acknowledge that there may be other variables they were unable to account for. \u201cDementia can\u2019t be cured,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Jens Sundboll, a resident in cardiology at Aarhus University in Denmark. \u201cWhat\u2019s the solution?

["technology", "At C.D.C., a Debate Behind Recommendations on Cellphone Risk - The New York Times When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new guidelines 18 months ago regarding the radiation risk from cellphones, it used unusually bold language on the topic for the American health agency: \u201cWe recommend caution in cellphone use.\u201d The agency\u2019s website previously had said that any risks \u201clikely are comparable to other lifestyle choices we make every day.\u201d Within weeks, though, the C.D.C. reversed course. It no longer recommended caution, and deleted a passage specifically addressing potential risks for children. Mainstream scientific consensus holds that there is little to no evidence that cellphone signals raise the risk of brain cancer or other health problems; rather, behaviors like texting while driving are seen as the real health concerns. Nevertheless, more than 500 pages of internal records obtained by The New York Times, along with interviews with former agency officials, reveal a debate and some disagreement among scientists and health agencies about what guidance to give as the use of mobile devices skyrockets. Although the initial C.D.C. changes, which were released in June 2014, had been three years in the making, officials quickly realized they had taken a step they were not prepared for. Health officials and advocates began asking if the new language represented a policy change. One state official raised the question of potential liabilities for allowing cellphones in schools."]
["technology", "C.D.C. officials began debating how to back away from their recommendation of caution, internal emails show. One official proposed saying instead that other countries \u2014 \u201cspecifically the United Kingdom and Canadian governments\u201d \u2014 recommended caution. Others suggested pointing to determinations by agencies in Finland, Israel and Austria. Ultimately, though, no other country was mentioned. Bernadette Burden, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said in a statement that the original changes made in June 2014 stemmed from \u201ca C.D.C.-wide effort to make health information for the public easier to understand\u201d but led to confusion that the agency was making a new policy statement. \u201cTo correct that misperception and to confirm that C.D.C. had not changed its policy or recommendations, C.D.C. posted a clarification statement,\u201d she said, adding that the cellphone industry did not weigh in before changes were made. Christopher J. Portier, former director of the National Center for Environmental Health, the C.D.C. division that made the changes, disagreed with the decision to pull back the revised version. \u201cI would not have removed it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI would have been in support of a recommendation that parents look carefully at whether their children need cellphones or not.\u201d Dr. Portier, who led the center when the revision process was initiated, said he believed parents should have been presented \u201cwith enough information to say caution isn\u2019t ill advised, because we really don\u2019t know, and there are enough indicators to say we should be cautious.\u201d"]
["technology", "Dr. Portier also served on the International Agency for Research of Cancer, a branch of the World Health Organization that in May 2011 called low-frequency radiation from cellphones and other devices a possible carcinogen, a designation that has also been used for coffee and pickled vegetables. He said the I.A.R.C. declaration led him to seek a review of the C.D.C. guidelines. Dr. Portier\u2019s view is not shared by many other experts. While sporadic claims about cellphones and cancer go back several decades, most American organizations echo the Federal Communications Commission, which says radio-frequency energy is not \u201ceffectively linked\u201d with \u201cany known health problems.\u201d Radiation released by nuclear bombs is obviously harmful. Known as ionizing radiation, it is powerful enough to remove electrons from atoms. By contrast, radio-frequency energy is a form of non-ionizing radiation given off by cellular and portable phones, Wi-Fi routers, baby monitors and countless other devices. John D. Boice Jr., president of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, said his own research had found \u201cno evidence for associations with brain tumors or any other cancers.\u201d The European Environment Agency, like some others in Europe, strikes a more cautious tone than American agencies. \u201cScientific opinion is split on the issue \u2014 many different studies have reached different conclusions based on the same evidence,\u201d the European agency says. It advocates \u201ca precautionary approach to policy making in this area.\u201d Regarding children, the European agency says, \u201cThere is sufficient evidence of risk to advise people, especially children, not to place the handset against their heads.\u201d"]
["technology", "Given the state of the research, the industry has rejected health concerns. When Berkeley, Calif., passed an ordinance last spring requiring retailers to warn customers that radiation emitted by cellphones could be hazardous, CTIA-The Wireless Association, an industry trade group, sued. It called the ordinance \u201cscientifically baseless and alarmist,\u201d adding that the federal government had determined that \u201ccellphones approved for sale in the United States, however worn, are safe for everyone.\u201d The lawsuit is pending. The study cited most often is Interphone, a multination review published by the I.A.R.C. in 2010. CTIA, in a statement, noted that Interphone found \u201cover all, no increase in risk.\u201d But Interphone did find \u201csome indications of an increased risk of glioma,\u201d a type of brain tumor, among the heaviest 10 percent of cellphone users, though \u201cthe researchers concluded that biases and errors limit the strength of these conclusions and prevent a causal interpretation.\u201d Dr. Elisabeth Cardis, Interphone\u2019s principal investigator, said in an interview, \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure there\u2019s an effect, but I can\u2019t say for sure there\u2019s no effect.\u201d However, the usage rates studied were far lower than those seen now, she said. The median call time in the study was two to two and a half hours per month. A Nielsen study in 2014 found that Americans used smartphones more than 34 hours a month, on average, though more often for games or social media than for communications."]
["technology", "Dr. Cardis is now conducting a large government-funded study in Europe of the potential risks of cellphone use among children. Nevertheless, she uses a mobile phone herself, as do her children \u2014 though she said it was prudent to use headsets or speakerphone, or to text, instead of holding the device next to your ear. \u201cIf there\u2019s a risk, it\u2019s likely to be greater for exposures at younger ages,\u201d she said, \u201csimply because the skull is thinner and the ears are thinner in children than in adults. Basically your phone is closer to your brain.\u201d The C.D.C.\u2019s internal email traffic shows a lengthy revision process for the agency\u2019s recommendations. After the announcement by the I.A.R.C. in 2011, one agency official wrote that there was \u201coutdated information on our current website.\u201d Some changes were made within days, though they did not mention the I.A.R.C. determination.

["sports/hockey", "Sides Still Far Apart in N.H.L. Labor Dispute - The New York Times After weeks of fitful negotiations, rejected offers and prickly rhetoric, the deadline for the N.H.L. to avoid a lockout passed without a resolution. Though the league did not make an announcement after the deadline, which was midnight Saturday, it was presumed that the league had shut down. It would be the N.H.L.\u2019s second lockout of the players since 2004, and the third since Gary Bettman became commissioner in 1993. Bettman had long promised a lockout if the players union did not agree to a new collective bargaining agreement. No major North American sports league has lost as many games to work stoppages in the last two decades as the N.H.L., all through owners\u2019 lockouts. Now the league is less than four weeks from losing more. With management and labor still far apart in talks for a new collective bargaining agreement, the start of the regular season on Oct. 11 is in jeopardy. The same is true for the opening of training camps Friday and the exhibition schedule, including an Oct. 2 Islanders-Devils game at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. All that will probably be lost. Many see the lockout lasting into December and perhaps beyond. On Saturday, and for a third straight day, only informal talks were held by telephone between the No. 2 men on the two sides: Bill Daly, the N.H.L. deputy commissioner, and Steve Fehr, the special counsel for the N.H.L. Players\u2019 Association and the brother of the union\u2019s executive director, Donald Fehr."]
["sports/hockey", "\u201cWe spoke today and determined that there was no point in convening a formal bargaining session in light of the fact that neither side is in a position to move off its last proposal,\u201d Daly said in a statement Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe are sorry for where we are. Not what we hoped or expected.\u201d Steve Fehr also released a statement. \u201cToday we suggested that the parties meet in advance of the owners\u2019 self-imposed deadline of midnight tonight,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cThe N.H.L. said that it saw no purpose in having a formal meeting.\u201d Daly and Fehr said that private, informal discussions between the sides would continue. Despite the N.H.L.\u2019s record financial growth in recent years, which reached $3.3 billion in revenue last season, the dispute centers on the owners\u2019 wish to reduce the amount they pay the players. Under the expiring contract, players received 57 percent of revenue. The owners\u2019 latest offer would leave them with 47 percent at the end of a six-year agreement, the equivalent of a 17.5 percent pay cut. The players have offered to accept roughly 53 percent. Bettman has frequently cited the deals basketball and football owners wrested from players after lockouts in 2011. In those cases, the players\u2019 share of revenue dropped similarly, to 50 percent or less from about 57 percent. \u201cIn two other leagues, the N.B.A. and the N.F.L., their players have recognized that in these economic times, there is a need to retrench,\u201d Bettman said Thursday."]
["sports/hockey", "The N.H.L.\u2019s previous lockout, in 2004-5, was the only work stoppage in North America to cost a major sports league a full season. Donald Fehr has frequently cited the 24 percent pay cut the players accepted to settle that lockout as one reason for objecting to the owners\u2019 current demands. \u201cFrom the players\u2019 standpoint, it\u2019s the owners\u2019 insistence that after seven years of record revenues and massive concessions the last time, they want the players to take another significant, absolute rollback in their compensation,\u201d Fehr said Thursday. Several players, including Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Henrik Lundqvist of the Rangers, said they would consider playing in European leagues if the lockout dragged on. In 2004-5, nearly 400 N.H.L. players \u2014 more than half the league \u2014 joined teams in Europe during the lockout. In a lockout, almost all league business ceases. Trades and other personnel moves cannot be made. Team facilities will be closed to players. Players will not receive paychecks, with exceptions in two categories. Injured players like the Rangers\u2019 Marian Gaborik, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, and Michael Sauer, who is out with a lingering concussion, will receive full salaries until team doctors declare them fit to play. In addition, players will receive outstanding signing bonuses. The four-year, $21.5 million contract Phoenix\u2019s Shane Doan signed Friday to stay with the Coyotes includes a $2 million signing bonus, which he will receive despite the lockout."]

That total since Bettman took the job in 1993, 1,698 regular-season games, exceeds the totals over the same period in Major League Baseball (948 games in addition to the postseason in the 1994 players\u2019 strike); in the N.B.A. (704 games in owners\u2019 lockouts last season and in 1998-99); and in the N.F.L.

Hertz, the car-rental company, found itself under siege by two major activist investors. As soon as Mondelez International finally acquiesced to one activist, Trian, by giving it a seat on the board, Mr. Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management, showed up.

The Americans received a favorable grouping on Saturday, as FIFA held its draw for the World Cup qualifying tournament during an elaborate ceremony in St. Petersburg, Russia. The United States will face Trinidad and Tobago and the winners of matches between St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Aruba, and Antigua and Barbuda and Guatemala. If the United States finishes as one of the top two teams after its group concludes home-and-away round-robin play, it will advance to the final round of qualifying, known as the hexagonal, which pits six teams against one another in another home-and-away round robin. Three guaranteed spots in the World Cup are available, with the fourth-place team entering a playoff with a team from Asia. Group B appears to be the most difficult of the Concacaf groups drawn on Saturday, as Panama and Costa Rica could end up being joined by Jamaica and Haiti. Mexico and Honduras were the top two teams in Group A. Technically, the United States is entering the qualifying tournament at the fourth round, as Concacaf \u2014 the regional governing body overseeing soccer in the North and Central America and the Caribbean \u2014 has 35 members, and 17 were previously eliminated in the opening rounds.

As controversy over alleged corruption has enveloped FIFA in recent months, questions about the fate of the Russia World Cup and the 2022 event, in Qatar, have persisted. The awarding of hosting rights for those two tournaments has been scrutinized for potential improprieties. While Russian organizers have stated repeatedly they did nothing untoward in trying to win the bid, there has been speculation that the 2018 or 2022 tournament could be moved if it is proved that organizers acted improperly. With the qualifying draw being held on Saturday, however, it seems all but certain that Russia\u2019s tournament will proceed as planned, if only because Russia\u2019s national team, as hosts, was not drawn into the qualifying tournament for Europe. Re-inserting a team once qualifying has begun \u2014 if, say, the tournament were shifted to another country \u2014 would seem all but impossible.

["books", "Speed Limits - The New York Times PERSONAL VELOCITY By Rebecca Miller. 178 pp. New York: Grove Press. $23. In ''How to Become a Writer,'' a terrific early Lorrie Moore story, Moore parodies the trials and tribulations of Francie, a young writer with a penchant for bang-up plot twists: an elderly couple who accidentally shoot each other in the head with a shotgun; a couple who electrocute themselves by turning on a badly wired lamp; two violinists who inadvertently blow themselves up in a recital room; and so on. Moore's point is that writers who are just getting their sea legs have a tendency to shy away from truly explosive -- that is, internal -- material and rely, instead, on the external. Such is the case with a number of the stories in Rebecca Miller's first collection, ''Personal Velocity,'' which is nevertheless the work of a talented and highly visual writer. Miller, the daughter of the playwright Arthur Miller and an accomplished filmmaker (she wrote and directed ''Angela,'' a film that won awards at the Sundance festival and was released in 1996), has, much like a painter, organized her collection as a series of studies on the female form: each of the seven stories here is named for its female protagonist, each is told in a deliberately monochromatic third person, and each quickly places its subject in a defining -- and, unfortunately, often pat -- situation. Delia, for example, is a 29-year-old battered woman on the run with her three young children. Julianne is the 41-year-old wife of a renowned poet, who, by contrast, spends her days dabbling in poetry, splashing in her pool and baking bread for her glamorous dinner parties. Bryna, whose story follows Julianne's, is also in her 40's, but unlike Julianne -- whose house she cleans -- she is not beautiful or well educated, and lives an isolated existence with her husband, a farmer. Then there's Greta, an up-and-coming New York editor; Nancy, a lonely rich kid; Louisa, a struggling painter; and finally Paula, a pregnant, aimless 21-year-old who has just witnessed a horrifying accident."]
["books", "While Miller's intent to portray women of such varied classes, ages and circumstances is admirable, it is her adherence to this conceit, which frequently feels imposed rather than organic, that gets her into trouble. Too much time is spent making these characters' external situations believable, and too often Miller neglects dialogue and action in favor of exposition and flashback. In a summarizing voice (almost like a Hollywood voice-over), Miller informs us of crucial elements in Bryna's life -- her ''practically mute'' husband, bitter mother-in-law and distant kids -- rather than allowing us to experience Bryna's existence viscerally. The result is that when Bryna, at the story's end, begins screaming uncontrollably, we are utterly disassociated from this explosion. On the other hand, when Miller eases up on the defining situations her women find themselves in and focuses on their interior landscapes -- the to and fro of the human heart, the ungovernable pulls of desire, ambition and ambivalence -- both character and story resonate. ''Greta,'' one of the collection's strongest stories, charts a woman's painful realization that she's built her life and her marriage on a fault line. In an effort to distance herself from her family, Greta, the daughter of a famous Jewish lawyer (a ''moral giant,'' we are told), drops out of a promising law career, takes a job as a cookbook editor and burrows into a nest of domesticity with a sweet, laid-back Midwesterner. At first Greta feels ''the ambition draining out of her like pus from a lanced boil. She had stopped desiring other men. She wanted to have a baby. She was going to lead a simple, decent life.'' But the tangle of identity is not so easily undone. Greta is far more like her driven (and unfaithful) father than she would care to admit, and Miller affectingly dramatizes Greta's struggle to figure out who she wants to be and who she really is."]
["books", "Throughout this collection Miller gives us moments of fine, revelatory writing: a hospital waiting room is a ''sad choppy sea of people needing attention''; sex with the beautiful Julianne is like ''falling into a vat of gardenias and landing on a lovely fat sleepy sow''; and a creep is efficiently sketched with one line: ''he was bald, with a ponytail.'' But one can't help feeling that Rebecca Miller, like Lorrie Moore's Francie, hasn't fully mastered the art of fictional alchemy, of turning inside out the material that truly moves her."]
["world/americas", "New Scrutiny on Vote Buying as Argentine Elections Near - The New York Times BUENOS AIRES \u2014  Some voters received sacks stuffed with bottles of cooking oil, pasta and flour. Others were ferried to the polls in convoys of cars. There were even reports of a raffle in which the grand prize was a Chevrolet. In return, the voters promised to cast their ballots for particular candidates during recent municipal elections in Tucum\u00e1n, in the north of Argentina. The rampant vote buying was branded a \u201cscourge\u201d last month by judges looking into the validity of the polls, although the results were allowed to stand since the practice, which experts say is widespread in Argentina, is not actually illegal. The vote buying, documented by election observers from the National University of La Plata and highlighted in the news media, has ignited debates about the frailty of the country\u2019s democracy as it prepares for presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday. \u201cThe problem is poverty and that there are people willing to lose their voting freedom for a bag of food,\u201d Margarita Stolbizer, a candidate for the Progressive Front, said in an interview with the newspaper Perfil. Vote buying strategies will probably sway 5 to 12 percent of Argentine voters on Sunday, according to estimates by Rodrigo Zarazaga, the director of the Center for Research and Social Action, a Jesuit institute. Mr. Zarazaga is an expert on clientelism, the term used when politicians turn the electorate into clients over a long period of time, offering services and goods in exchange for support, a common practice in the region that has been closely scrutinized here in recent weeks."]

The party has been in power since 2003, and is well placed to secure a fourth consecutive term in Sunday\u2019s elections, led by Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s successor, Daniel Scioli. Some party officials conceded that there was vote buying in Tucum\u00e1n, where the party\u2019s candidate for governor, Juan Luis Manzur, won easily.

Other practices condemned by the judges were the use of convoys, reported by election observers, to transport voters to polling places and raffles organized in the days before the elections. One Front for Victory official raffled off a Chevrolet hatchback car, according to the local news media."]
["world/americas", "There is no provision in Argentina\u2019s electoral code that explicitly criminalizes vote buying. Julia Pomares, a specialist on election issues and director at Cippec, an Argentine public policy research center, noted that the validity of the elections in Tucum\u00e1n was challenged on constitutional grounds. Because polling booths ensure secrecy, the judges decided, vote buying does not actually suppress the constitutional right to freely choose candidates. Politicians often use networks of go-betweens, known as \u201cpunteros,\u201d to whom they give public funds and resources. They supply poor voters with basic items, like food, medicine and construction materials, experts say. Often, these campaign workers \u2014 who were the subject of a fictional hit TV series in 2011 called \u201cThe Puntero\u201d \u2014 also hand out welfare benefits and jobs. In Argentina, the punteros are largely concentrated in the sprawling outskirts of Buenos Aires, the capital city that is home to nearly a third of the country. In these outlying neighborhoods, Peronists have the most extensive networks, Mr. Zarazaga said. But other parties, like Republican Proposal, led by Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires and Mr. Scioli\u2019s chief rival in the elections, also rely on punteros. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic and commonplace practice; Peronism gets stigmatized, but there\u2019s no party that hasn\u2019t used it,\u201d said Mario G\u00f3mez, 58, who works at a cultural center in Villa 21-24, a slum on the city\u2019s south side."]

["travel", "The Latest on Ebola and Travel - The New York Times The international response to the West African Ebola outbreak has affected travel by air, rail and cruise ship. And the news that a nurse who contracted Ebola while treating its first casualty in the United States flew commercially and another employee who was not infected was aboard a cruise ship has stoked fears that it could spread here. Here is a guide to how the travel industry and the government has responded. Are people potentially exposed to the virus allowed to travel? There is no travel ban in effect. However, since two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where the first Ebola victim in the United States died, were diagnosed with Ebola in the past two weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stepped up efforts to monitor other hospital employees who may have been exposed to the virus. It now has asked that staff involved in treating Michael Eric Duncan, the Liberian who died of Ebola in Texas, avoid public spaces. One infected nurse traveled from Dallas to Cleveland and back again on a commercial flight, resulting in the closure of public schools in both Texas and Ohio. Another employee, a lab supervisor who may have had contact with specimens of the virus, was found to be aboard the Carnival Magic, a commercial cruise ship on a voyage to Belize last week."]
["travel", "The C.D.C. notified Carnival of the passenger on Wednesday, according to a statement from the cruise line. The employee and her traveling partner, remained in voluntary isolation in a cabin aboard the ship throughout the voyage, which returned to and Galveston, Tex., Sunday morning. She was monitored by a physician throughout the trip and remained asymptomatic. A blood test on Sunday confirmed that she did not have Ebola, Roger Frizzell, a spokesman from Carnival said. \u201cThe Galveston County Health District, as part of the Unified Command, has reviewed all available information regarding a potential Ebola contact voluntarily isolated on a cruise ship returning to the Port of Galveston Sunday, Oct. 19,\u201d a statement from Carnival said. \u201cThis morning, the Galveston County Health Authority has made the assessment that there is no evidence of a public health threat to cruise passengers or to Galveston County. The passenger and her travel partner have been allowed to disembark without restrictions.\u201d Any passenger sailing with the line must answer a series of health screening questions during embarkation, according to an earlier statement from Carnival, and any guest or crew member who has visited or traveled through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea within 21 days of a cruise departure date will be denied boarding. Can you get Ebola by sharing a flight with someone who is infected? "]
["travel", "It\u2019s not likely. The disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids \u2014 blood, vomit, urine, diarrhea \u2014 of a contagious person, and those people are unlikely to feel well enough to fly. And in one case in which a passenger who was vomiting from the illness did fly from Monrovia to Lagos in late July, none of the roughly 200 people on his flight fell ill. How are air travelers being screened in the United States?  Enhanced screening measures are in effect at five major hubs for passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, including temperature checks and detailed questioning on arrival. The screenings are taking place at Kennedy Airport in New York, Washington Dulles International, O\u2019Hare International, Hartsfield-Jackson International and Newark Liberty International. Passengers will also undergo detailed questioning upon their arrival. Passengers at other points of entry will continue to be screened by customs agents, who examine travelers for visible signs of illness and distribute fact sheets to those who have traveled in West African nations affected by the outbreak. In addition, the T.S.A. is providing guidance to airlines on how to identify passengers who are ill. Are passengers being screened elsewhere? The broader E.U. said that it would look into whether screening at points of origin in West Africa is sufficient Reuters reported, and that if not, it would strengthen that process. It also plans to better coordinate screening at some airports within the union."]
["travel", "Britain has begun screening travelers from affected West African countries at Heathrow Airport in London and plans to also do so at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals. And France has announced that it would screen air passengers at Charles de Gaulle in Paris, according to The Associated Press. Screenings are also taking place at Canadian airports and at Cairo\u2019s as people return from Haj. People departing the West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak are screened before they fly. They must fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a visual assessment and a temperature check by a noncontact thermometer. Hong Kong International Airport has begun encouraging travelers who have been to Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo within the past three weeks, or who hold a passport or other travel document from those countries, to fill out a voluntary screening questionnaire upon their arrival at the airport, Mashable.com reported. The questionnaire covers a person\u2019s travel history, health status and any contact they may have had with infected persons. Travelers exhibiting symptoms of Ebola or who may have been exposed to the virus will be referred to the Infectious Disease Center of Hong Kong at Princess Margaret Hospital for further testing and evaluation.\u200b \u201cThese are supplementary measures to existing border control measures,\u201d Dr. Edwin Tsui, Hong Kong\u2019s chief port health officer for the Department of Health, said at a press conference on Monday. \u201cNow we have temperature screening measures at borders and also ongoing health screening activities at borders to advise those incoming travelers who present illness to seek help from our port health officers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope these new, voluntary health surveillance questionnaire measures can supplement and also enhance our capacity to detect Ebola virus.\u201d"]

While the idea a travel ban on flights to and from those West African countries affected by Ebola is being debated, the Obama administration and the Department of Homeland Security announced that beginning Wednesday, anyone traveling to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will have to fly into one of the five U.S. \u200bairports where enhanced screening procedures were taking place, Reuters reported.  \u201cWe are working closely with the airlines to implement these restrictions with minimal travel disruption,\u201d Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security said in a statement. \u201cIf not already handled by the airlines, the few impacted travelers should contact the airlines for rebooking, as needed.\u201d About nine people per day will have their flights rerouted due to the new restriction, according to a statement from Airlines for America, a trade group made up of several major U.S. carriers. Several cruise lines have voluntarily altered their routes to avoid the West African coast. Are carriers still operating flights to affected nations?  Some international airlines, including British Airways and Kenya Airways, have suspended flights since August. But others, including Royal Air Maroc, have regularly scheduled departures to destinations in West Africa. Keep in mind that the C.D.C. has advised avoiding nonessential travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. What are air carriers doing?  Airlines follow general guidelines issued by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization. They have also informed their flight attendants about the hazards of Ebola, its symptoms and how the disease is spread."]
["travel", "The C.D.C. has asked United States airlines and international airlines with direct flights to or from the United States to begin asking any sick passenger if they had traveled to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in the past 21 days. If the answer is yes and the passenger is exhibiting symptoms of Ebola specifically, the airline must report the incident immediately to the C.D.C. and follow the agency\u2019s infection control guidelines, according to the agency\u2019s Ebola Guidance for Airlines advisory. In general, the guidelines call for flight crews to take steps to protect themselves as well as other passengers, including washing their hands often and thoroughly, wearing waterproof gloves and face masks when dealing with a sick passenger and treating any and all bodily fluids as if they were contagious. Sick passengers are also advised to wear a face mask, unless they are nauseated or vomiting. To minimize exposure, the C.D.C. also advises isolating sick passengers as much as possible and minimizing crew and passenger interactions with them. Strict cleaning procedures are also outlined for in-flight and ground crews, both of which are instructed to wear personal protective equipment like aprons, goggles and other gear typically included in a Universal Precaution Kit, which the International Civil Aviation Organization has recommended all airlines traveling to countries affected with Ebola carry."]
["travel", "Plastic bags are to be used to dispose of tissues and any other waste that might have been used to clean the area in which the passenger is seated, and then must be sealed tightly, much as a hospital does with biohazards. Once on the ground, any soiled area of the plane that cannot be thoroughly disinfected is to be removed, according to the C.D.C. If a flight attendant becomes sick mid-flight, they are required to stop work immediately and isolate themselves. Airlines are working closely with the C.D.C. and the Department of Homeland Security to mitigate risk to the traveling public and airline employees, as they have done in the past during SARS and H1N1 Virus outbreaks, Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines For America, the trade group for major airlines, said in an email. Crew members have been trained in the C.D.C.'s infection control procedures and all members of the group carry Universal Precaution Kits aboard their planes, she confirmed. Flight attendants have been trained to passively screen passengers for several types of illnesses, she continued. \u201cOnce someone does appear to have symptoms, airlines have had the ability to directly connect with medical experts midflight to consult on whether there is an actual concern about Ebola. This includes connecting with the C.D.C. emergency operations center.\u201d"]
["travel", "Should that rare situation occur, she said, airlines are instructed to do everything they can to isolate the passenger to the best extent possible, while also complying with all F.A.A. safety rules, including having all passengers remain in their seats. Some aircrafts, however, may have a configuration that allows for a passenger to be seated in a less-crowded section of the plane or to be seated away from others. \u201cWhile we understand there is heightened concern, it\u2019s important to remember that this is not an airborne disease, nor is it easily transmittable, particularly when common hygiene precautions are followed,\u201d Ms. Medina said. \u201cThe C.D.C. has consistently noted that there is virtually no risk to air travelers, no matter where you travel. There are screening procedures in place today in West Africa, in the United States and in Europe, and airlines have always had the authority, as granted by Congress, to restrict passengers whose travel might cause harm to themselves or others.\u201d Reporting by Rachel Lee Harris, Emily Brennan and Nicola Clark."]
["world/middleeast", "Mubarak Tells Court He Gave All For Egypt - The New York Times CAIRO \u2014 In his first public statement since his ouster in the Arab Spring revolts, former President Hosni Mubarak told a Cairo court on Wednesday that history would vindicate his self-sacrifice as a servant of the people. Called to testify about charges that he had directed the killing of protesters, Mr. Mubarak took the opportunity to recite the achievements of what he called a 62-year career of service to Egypt. \u201cI exhausted my life fighting against enemies of the homeland,\u201d Mr. Mubarak said. \u201cThe wheel of history can never roll backward, and no one can falsify the facts.\u201d Once reviled for the brutality and corruption of his 30-year rule as president, Mr. Mubarak seems to be enjoying a modest revival in his reputation after three years of tumult that followed his ouster. A military takeover last summer brought to power another military-backed strongman, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and some Egyptians now acknowledge a measure of nostalgia for the stability of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s era. Many more view him with growing indifference, as an old-timer watching from the sidelines as Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood swept into the presidency in Egypt\u2019s first free election, and Mr. Sisi swept him out just 12 months later."]
["world/middleeast", "Mr. Mubarak, 86, now lives in police custody in a military hospital overlooking the Nile, but on Wednesday, he sounded as proud and defiant as he did in his last speeches from the presidential palace on the eve of his ouster. Wearing a dark blue shirt open at the collar, he sat upright in the hospital gurney that has carried him into all of his many court sessions. He wore glasses and read a prepared statement. But his hair was still unusually thick and black for a man his age, just as it was in the photographs that once adorned billboards, police stations and public offices across Egypt. At times, Mr. Mubarak seemed to implicitly criticize his old office\u2019s new occupant, Mr. Sisi, over his tacit support for Israel in its current battle with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. Mr. Mubarak dwelled at length on what he said was his own firm opposition to Israel and his support for the Palestinians. \u201cI have managed relationships with Israel like a man walking a tightrope, without any compromise on national sovereignty or the Palestinian people\u2019s rights,\u201d Mr. Mubarak said. \u201cConsidering Palestinian interests, I have never hesitated a moment in providing Egypt\u2019s aid to those under siege in Gaza.\u201d His voice caught for a moment as he alluded to his own mortality. \u201cPerhaps my talk today is the last I speak to the sons of my nation before life reaches its end, and the time has come, and I am hidden in Egypt\u2019s pure dust,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God, conscience at rest, that I spent my life fighting for Egypt and its children.\u201d Echoing the advice of autocrats everywhere, he admonished: \u201cTake care of the country\u2019s unity.

["world/middleeast", "But his own legacy was his main theme. \u201cI never sought any position or power,\u201d Mr. Mubarak said, recalling his military service in wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973 as well as Egypt\u2019s economic expansion during his years as president. \u201cWe freed our economy, and opened it to the world, and provided a suitable atmosphere to attract investment,\u201d he said, declaring that he had \u201cachieved the highest growth rates in history.\u201d None of that was relevant to the case: It was a retrial ordered after an appeals court overturned a 2012 conviction on charges of overseeing the killing of hundreds of Egyptians by security forces during the protests that ended his rule. The judge in that case had issued a life sentence even while acknowledging a lack of direct evidence that Mr. Mubarak had ordered the killings. The court said Wednesday that it would deliver its verdict in the retrial on Sept. 27. But even if acquitted, Mr. Mubarak may not walk free. In May, he was sentenced to three years in jail in a separate embezzlement case involving the diversion of public funds through a state-owned construction company for his family\u2019s personal use."]
["living", "In This Bare-It-All Age, Bikinis Are Back - The New York Times Leesa Leverette, an educational tester from Savannah, Ga., does not easily fit the old profile of someone who would be moved to push a credit card across a counter in exchange for a neon-peach string bikini. To begin with, Ms. Leverette is 40 and the mother of a 10-year-old. Recently though, she found herself at a swimwear shop on Tybee Island, Ga., trying on the $48 suit and thinking, ''O.K., this is acceptable -- this feels good.'' Good is generally not how most women at midlife feel in garments the size of a Crayola box. ''I'm not 25,'' Ms. Leverette said. ''I'm not out there trying to scope out guys. Whatever I feel good in is what I'm going to wear to the beach.'' Against a cultural landscape in which generously exposed skin has attained the shock value of a white lie, the bikini, which fell from favor in the 90's, is enjoying a vibrant comeback in the United States, including among women whose adolescent years are a dim memory. At In Toto, a Minneapolis boutique, a gingham bikini that ties at the hip had a waiting list of customers, women in their late 30's and 40's among them. At H&M on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, customers 17 to 51 plucked leopard-print bikinis and tiny lavender crocheted ones whose brevity recalls the Italian Riviera in 1968."]
["living", "''Bikinis are bigger than they have been in longer than anyone here can remember,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, fashion director of Bloomingdale's, where bikinis make up 54 percent of swimsuit sales, a 25 percent increase over last year. ''You go out at night and you see people in cropped tops and low-cut pants -- that's conditioned people toward the bikini.'' Larger social and cultural forces are also at work, among them the premium placed on fitness training by women in their 40's and up, and the increased acceptability of plastic surgery. But perhaps the strongest influence is pop culture's latest adoration of bareness, so ripely displayed by stars like Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Pamela Anderson. From the undergarment-inspired dresses and evening tops of high-end labels like Gucci and Chlo\u00e9 to the midriff-baring T-shirts advocated by teenage stars, less is more. The new J. Crew catalog is advocating string-tied leather bras with jeans. The recent film ''Someone Like You'' had Ashley Judd working as a talent scout in spaghetti straps, while Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Bridget Jones, book publicist, went about her job with black bra in full view. Vanity Fair's June cover has Ms. Lopez forgoing styles inspired by lingerie and posing in actual lingerie: pearl-encrusted silk briefs with a matching bra. ''People are comfortable exposing more,'' said Mari Morsch, an owner of Three Sisters, a boutique in Lake Forest, Ill., where bikinis are outselling one-piece suits three to one. ''They want tight-fitting clothes,'' Ms. Morsch said of her customers, many of them women in their 40's and 50's. ''I wouldn't be able to give away a pair of pleated pants.''"]
["living", "The NPD Group, a market research company based in Port Washington, N.Y., reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide -- including classic bikinis and more modest variations -- jumped 80 percent in two years, to $566.1 million last year from $313.8 million in 1998. Sales of one-piece suits declined 23.7 percent over this period, to $763.3 million from $1 billion. Retailers say teenagers and young women are still the major buyers, but women over 30 make up an increasing share. Linda Wachner, chief executive of Warnaco, which under its Authentic Fitness division makes the swimwear lines Anne Cole, Speedo and Lauren by Ralph Lauren, said bikini sales got a jolt a few years ago from the introduction of the tankini, a midriff-concealing two-piece. The two-piece business, which accounted for 25 percent of Authentic Fitness's sales three years ago, now contributes 45 percent. Retailers report that the tankini's popularity has waned. Credit -- or blame -- for the bikini lies with a French engineer, Louis R\u00e9ard, who invented it in 1946 while running his mother's lingerie business. It was named for the Pacific atoll used for nuclear testing. The suit was scorned by Parisian runway models of the day, who found it too risqu\u00e9. Unlike the ribbed one-piece swimsuit first mass-produced by Carl Jantzen in 1913 -- allowing women the mobility to swim rather than wade -- the bikini's sole objective was to objectify, as Brigitte Bardot films made abundantly clear. (Jantzen's tasteful but groundbreaking one-piece followed women's entry into Olympic swimming events, in 1912.)"]
["living", "The bikini did not begin to appear on American shorelines until the chaste Hollywood beach movies of the 60's (and an appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1964) legitimized it, chipping away at its image of louche sexuality. But in the 80's, fashion's cinched-waist silhouette regenerated interest in the 50's-style one-piece suits that would have found favor with Mamie Eisenhower. In the 1990's, the sleek, androgynous look that characterized so much of fashion from Prada to J. Crew to the Gap left the bikini eclipsed by the streamline, less provocative one-piece tank suit. A key to the bikini's re-emergence is aging baby boomers conditioned by a fitness-obsessed culture now two decades old. ''This is a group inculcated with the idea that they won't ever grow old,'' said Kathy Peiss, a professor of women's history at the University of Massachusetts and the author of ''Hope in a Jar: The Making of America's Beauty Culture'' (Henry Holt, 1998). Georgea Fenady, 41, a mother of two in Los Angeles who goes to the gym five days a week, would find little argument with that. ''I've always had tiny string bikinis, and I refused to give them up,'' Ms. Fenady said. For Roberta Horowitz, in her 40's and a mother of two in Woodcliff Lakes, N.J., workouts have intensified as she's gotten older. Last year, a flirtation with a one-piece suit ended in failure. ''I wore it once, and I'm never going to wear it again,'' Ms. Horowitz said. She said the suit was uncomfortable and unflattering. Last month she bought three bikinis."]
["living", "As women's suits are shrinking, men's are growing larger. The men's Speedo, the abbreviated staple of St. Tropez -- ground zero in the bikini world -- stubbornly refuses to dominate stateside. Speedo's summer catalog features something called ''water shorts'' -- baggy swimsuits that hit the knee. The rise of the bikini, which accentuates rather than diminishes the breast, correlates with an increase in cosmetic surgery, including breast augmentations, which more than doubled, to 203,310, from 1997 to 2000,  the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reports. Movies, magazines, television and video games have trained the eye to consider the enhanced breast the norm, said Susan Bordo, a professor of philosophy at the University of Kentucky and the author of ''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture and the Body'' (University of California Press, 1993). And many women have been sculpturing their muscles in a way that makes them look more like men, as well as suctioning away fat. The number of liposuctions has also more than doubled since 1997. ''In so many ways women's bodies have become more androgynous,'' Ms. Bordo said. Of the resurgence of the bigger-breasted figure, she added, ''It's very important -- for people to whom it is still important to make gender distinctions -- to have this last remaining marker of femininity.'' A number of plastic surgeons, like Dr. Michael Kane, who has a practice on Manhattan's East Side, said that the majority of women signing up for breast enlargement were older than 35 and married with children. Many, he said, hoped to look more defined in clothes and bathing suits."]
["living", "''Sometimes, I didn't think I looked good in a bikini,'' said Theresa Baker, 38, a mother and cardiac care nurse from Montgomeryville, Pa., who went to Dr. Kane for breast implants last month. After the surgery, Ms. Baker said, ''I went major bathing-suit shopping.'' At California Sunshine, a chain of swimsuit stores in New Jersey, Delaware and other Eastern states, two-piece suits now account for 65 percent of the business, up from 40 percent three years ago, Stephanie Pickelny, the head buyer, said. Ren\u00e9e Buda, the assistant buyer, attributed the trend in part to the popularity of breast implants. ''We're selling larger-size tops and smaller-size bottoms,'' Ms. Buda said. ''You see your 20-somethings with implants, your 30-somethings with implants and your 40-somethings with implants.'' Susan Brodsky, 48, a Los Angeles mother of two, points to another force edging bikini sales along: exhaustion. Ms. Brodsky replaced three worn tank suits with bikinis, in part because she did not want to look ''matronly,'' she said, but also because she no longer felt the need to be model-thin to reveal more of herself. ''When I was in my 20's and 30's, perfection was a huge deal,'' Ms. Brodsky said. ''I realized that I can do 50 million situps, and at the end of the day I'm 48. Look at all the guys who have a little fat.''"]

["sports/basketball", "As N.B.A.\u2019s D-League Celebrates the Future, Older Players Savor Their Invitations - The New York Times The N.B.A. Development League staged its annual All-Star Game at Barclays Center on Sunday afternoon, pitting the Western Conference Prospects against the Eastern Conference Futures. If the team names were not indication enough that the event was geared around the twin concepts of youth and potential, two supplemental activities \u2014 a 3-point shootout before the game and a dunk contest at halftime \u2014 were billed by the league as the Dream Factory. For young players from teams like the Santa Cruz Warriors and the Canton Charge \u2014 the unsung, the unknown, the undrafted \u2014 the events presented a rare opportunity to share the bright lights of All-Star weekend with their N.B.A. brethren, and perhaps even impress a few of the big-league scouts and front-office types who were sitting courtside. And then there was Damien Wilkins, who, at 35, started for the Futures \u2014 \u201cHow ironic is that?\u201d he asked \u2014 and was the only person in the building who had played four seasons with the Seattle SuperSonics.

["sports/basketball", "On Sunday, Wilkins assumed his familiar role as D-League elder statesman and was unwilling to cede the stage. He cluttered the box score by launching 15 shots in 21 minutes and scored 13 points in the Futures\u2019 129-94 victory over the Prospects. \u201cWhen they approached me about this, there was no doubt I was coming,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to what I\u2019ve been doing in the D-League this season. I wanted to come here to represent myself, my family, my team \u2014 and try to put on a good show.\u201d His basketball odyssey has included stints with the Sonics, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Atlanta Hawks, the Detroit Pistons, the Philadelphia 76ers, the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association and, most recently, the Indios de Mayag\u00fcez of Puerto Rico\u2019s Baloncesto Superior Nacional. Wilkins has been a teammate of Kevin Durant and Stephon Marbury. He has competed in the N.B.A. playoffs. He has made a handsome living. But he tends not to view basketball in the past tense, which he made clear when he referred to the D-League All-Star Game as the \u201copportunity of a lifetime\u201d \u2014 and actually seemed to mean it. \u201cYou can\u2019t take this for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my right to be here.

(Curry\u2019s brother, Stephen, won the N.B.A. version of the event on Saturday.) And in the dunk contest, Jarvis Threatt of the Rio Grande Valley Vipers posted two perfect scores to edge Thanasis Antetokounmpo of the Westchester Knicks. Threatt, 21, went between his legs on his final attempt and then stole one of the judge\u2019s cards to give himself a 10. The game itself had more of a vintage feel. Andre Emmett, a 32-year-old journeyman with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, shot 10 of 14 from the field, including 4 of 6 from 3-point range, to finish with 28 points. He was named the game\u2019s most valuable player. Emmett said he wanted another crack at the N.B.A. \u201cYou never know,\u201d said Emmett, who appeared in eight games with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2004-5 and in six games with the Nets in 2011-12. \u201cJust be patient and keep grinding and pray something good comes of it.\u201d Emmett kept using the word \u201cbusiness\u201d \u2014 as in, the game was business for him, and that mentality was shared by pretty much everyone involved. Both teams played defense, which is generally absent from the All-Star code of conduct. But these players were vying for something \u2014 for N.B.A. contracts \u2014 or at least that was the hope."]

So far this season, 25 D-League players have been signed by N.B.A. teams, tangible proof to players like Frazier that the dream is not so distant. And then there are veterans like Wilkins, one of 12 players in Sunday\u2019s game with N.B.A. experience and a shared desire to return. \u201cI think I can come in and fill a role,\u201d said Wilkins, who is averaging 20.8 points and 6.3 rebounds with the Energy, the D-League affiliate of the Grizzlies. On Sunday, Wilkins leaked out for a series of fast-break dunks that were distinctly old-school: two hands, authoritative, no frills. At this stage of his professional life, Wilkins knows that 2 points are 2 points, that the aesthetics make no difference. And while he could be making more money overseas, he said he viewed the D-League as his most effective path to the N.B.A. \u201cI want for those people to see the improvements I\u2019ve made as a player, and to show that I can still help a team win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want.\u201d His dream is a timeless one, even if his career has an expiration date.

["business", "Experts Oppose Ebola Travel Ban, Saying It Would Cut Off Worst-Hit Countries - The New York Times Fear of Ebola is spreading faster than the disease itself, and the growing paranoia in the United States is fueling calls to impose a travel ban on people coming from the three West African nations struggling with the outbreak. In a politically tense climate, with the Nov. 4 elections just weeks away, the issue is being supercharged by partisan considerations with prominent Republicans calling for a ban, including John Boehner, the House speaker. But public health officials say a travel ban would be ineffective and difficult to carry out and would not entirely prevent people in Ebola-hit countries from entering the United States. Ultimately, health specialists said, a ban would do more harm than good because it would isolate impoverished nations that are barely able to cope with the outbreak, and possibly cut them off from the international aid workers who provide critical help to contain the disease. The White House on Thursday repeated its opposition to such a ban. President Obama said that he was following the advice of health experts and that \u201ca travel ban is less effective than the measures that we are currently instituting.\u201d \u201cIf one takes the big-picture view the most important thing that can be done to protect Americans from Ebola is controlling Ebola in West Africa,\u201d said Dr. Barry R. Bloom, a specialist in infectious diseases and public health professor at Harvard."]
["business", "But Ebola evokes irrational fears \u2014 the disease is extremely infectious but also tremendously hard to catch \u2014 and authorities must tackle a public health crisis as well as manage public confidence. So far, only one person has died in the United States from Ebola \u2014 a Liberian man who flew from Monrovia to Brussels and then to Dallas. Two nurses who helped treat him at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital contracted the disease. Fears of contagion spiked after one of the nurses said she had been on a domestic flight the day before she was admitted with symptoms of Ebola. That prompted some schools in Texas and Ohio to close. Authorities have since asked that staff members involved in treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian who died of Ebola, to avoid public spaces. Denying entry to people from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone would not stop the spread of Ebola into the United States, said Aditya Bhattacharji, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk firm. A ban, he noted, would be impossible to accomplish with 100 percent effectiveness. What would happen with United States citizens visiting those countries and returning home, for instance? How about dual-nationals who don\u2019t need a visa into the United States? How about other foreign nationals who visited West Africa? Health quarantines have a long history, going back to the bubonic plague in Venice, said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases at the University of Michigan. But in recent decades, even with diseases that are much more readily contagious than Ebola, travel bans have been rejected."]
["business", "A travel ban was never adopted in the 2003 SARS outbreak, which started in Asia, although it affected about 8,000 people worldwide, killing 774 of them. In that case, the World Health Organization issued a travel advisory, Dr. Markel said. The closest that the United States has come to a travel ban was barring entry to people with H.I.V. or AIDS in a 1987 decision during the Reagan administration. That ban, which did not apply to specific countries, was lifted by President Obama. Mr. Bhattacharji pointed out that after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, all flights in the United States were grounded for days. That radical measure had an unexpected consequence: it delayed the flu season by two weeks. It was the only example he could point to where travel restrictions actually slowed down the spread of a disease. While the prevention and screening measures in place today are far from perfect, they allow public officials to track down sick travelers and understand their travel pattern. A ban might lead people to hide their tracks, making it harder to find out who they met or where they came from. There are no direct flights from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea to the United States and only a handful of international flights to Europe. People flying out of these countries are screened before they board a plane. Health workers check their temperature and look for visible signs of illness."]
["business", "Public officials acknowledge that more cases of Ebola are inevitable in the United States, but can be managed. Last week, the Obama administration said that it would increase screening measures for travelers coming from West Africa at four airports, something European countries are already doing. Some African countries, like Ivory Coast, have curtailed access to people from neighboring Ebola-afflicted nations, and sharply limited cases of the virus. Dr. Gerald Weissmann, research professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, said he favored a travel ban on \u201canyone coming from Ebola-infected areas,\u201d as documented on their passports or visas. \u201cThe objections are very humane and very lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cThey consider quarantines medieval, and think there\u2019s a touch of racism in this. It may be, but I wouldn\u2019t care if Ebola came from Sweden.\u201d Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, like blood or vomit. Unlike the flu, which kills tens of thousands of people each year, there is no vaccine against Ebola and there is no cure. It also has a mortality rate of about 50 percent. That said, the risk of catching Ebola is extremely low. There is no risk of transmission from people who have been exposed to the virus but are not yet showing symptoms. Bleach solutions can kill it. The best way to contain the spread of Ebola is to avoid direct contact with people who have been contaminated."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR; Bush Planning To See Voters, And to Be Seen - The New York Times Gov. George W. Bush today dismissed criticism from some Republicans over the direction of his campaign. But he also called himself the underdog in the race and said he would restyle his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with voters. Mr. Bush and his aides said he would start appearing at town hall meetings again as early as next week. Such sessions disappeared in March after Senator John McCain dropped from the Republican race. Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said the Texas governor was also likely to start dropping into coffee shops and cafeterias and might begin to visit families to discuss how his tax cut plan would affect them. Asked why he wanted to hold such events, Mr. Bush said, ''Well, it's a  better picture.'' He said that if his unscripted encounters were mostly with reporters on his campaign plane, ''people don't get a sense of  my ability to relate to people. They don't get a sense that my plan has got real purposes for real people.'' Ms. Hughes repeatedly used a similar phrase, ''real plans for real people,'' making it clear that this was the Bush campaign's new slogan. Mr. Bush made his comments at an impromptu news conference on an airport tarmac in Detroit after prominent Republicans across the country expressed concern over the state of his campaign and after a series of national and state polls showed that Vice President Al Gore was solidifying the gains he had made after the Democratic National Convention."]
["us", "A poll released today by ABC News and The Washington Post found the race tied, with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore each attracting 47 percent. A Gallup Organization poll for CNN and USA Today found Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush, 47 percent to 44 percent, a result that is also essentially a tie, since it is within the margin of error. While Mr. Bush said today that he would change some campaign events, he also waved off some of the second-guessing. ''That's Washington,'' he said. ''That's people getting ready to jump out of the foxhole before the first shell is fired.'' Mr. Bush used the military analogy on a day when he campaigned with two of the most prominent figures of his father's administration, Colin L. Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and J. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded United States troops during the Persian Gulf war of 1991. Both voiced support for Mr. Bush's contention that President Clinton had allowed the military to deteriorate, leaving it unprepared for post-cold-war conflicts. And Mr. Powell called Mr. Bush ''a man with a mission, a man with vision, a man who is committed to making sure the armed forces of the United States will always be the best.'' Many of the Republicans who had voiced concerns about the shape of the Bush campaign seemed particularly concerned about Mr. Bush's refusal to agree to debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. They said his stance had made him seem timid and had taken him into an unproductive fight over political process rather than issues."]
["us", "While he continued to criticize Mr. Gore for rejecting his offer for a different set of debates -- two of them shorter and to more limited audiences than the commission debates -- Mr. Bush for the first time gave some suggestion that there was give to his position. ''There will be debates,'' he said. ''I am confident there will be debates. As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out in due course.'' Mr. Bush even joked that he ''may go more alpha male coming down the stretch.'' That was a dig at Mr. Gore, who had a feminist author on his payroll last year, advising him how to dress and act like an alpha male. ''I'm under no illusions and neither should our supporters be -- it's going to be a tough contest,'' Mr. Bush said. Asked if he was the underdog, Mr. Bush jumped at the label. ''Yeah,'' he said. ''I'm the underdog. But I was the underdog when I first started.'' Mr. Bush's new campaign style is reminiscent of the retooling of his primary campaign in South Carolina in February after his drubbing by Mr. McCain in New Hampshire. Mr. Bush began holding town meetings, which had been his opponent's trademark. And he tried to appropriate Mr. McCain's reform mantle, calling himself a ''reformer with results.''"]
["us", "The events Mr. Bush and his aides were describing today, similarly echoed of the style of Mr. Gore, who has been holding town hall meetings, visiting teachers in their homes and stopping into coffee shops to talk to workers. Mr. Gore often talks of fighting for ''working people.'' Mr. Bush is now speaking of working for ''real people.'' Ms. Hughes said the governor and his aides had thought they were not being ''creative'' enough. She said the campaign had fallen into auto-pilot, simply using the rally formats that had worked so well for the governor on his ride into the Republican National Convention. She said Mr. Bush wanted to put a human face on his policy proposals by meeting with people and showing how they would benefit under his plans. The Gore campaign derided Mr. Bush's portrayal of himself as an underdog. ''This is a guy who raised $100 million in this campaign, a record, from the special interests -- the H.M.O's, the prescription drug companies and the big oil industry,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''It's Al Gore who has an agenda that represents the underdog and George W. Bush who has an agenda that represents the special interests.'' Mr. Bush's new style was not visible today, however, as he turned to military themes and showcased at his side Mr. Powell and Mr. Schwarzkopf. At Wright University here, under a banner proclaiming ''Respecting America's Military,'' Mr. Bush introduced the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Desert Storm commander, and each one gave him a strong endorsement as the best man to be commander in chief."]
["us", "Mr. Bush also hinted at stops across the day that should he be elected, he would name Mr. Powell to his administration. ''The general talked about being retired from public service,'' he said here, then glanced at Mr. Powell and added puckishly, ''If all goes well. . . .'' The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Mr. Bush pledged that he would push for modernization of the military to meet the new threats in the world. And he said that the nation had the chance to ''redefine how war is fought and won in the future, and therefore we have the opportunity to redefine how the peace is kept.'' Mr. Bush said that if elected, he would assemble a task force of military leaders to come up with a ''strategic plan'' for what the military of the future should look like. ''We know it's not going to look like the great American moment of Desert Storm and Desert Shield,'' Mr. Bush said. ''A military of the future is not going to be that heavy, and it's not going to be that hard to move.'' Today's events were designed to put the gulf war leaders at center stage in order to endorse the son of the man they served under. General Schwarzkopf called himself proud to ''stand up and endorse'' Mr. Bush. Mr. Powell lambasted the Clinton administration for hurting military readiness, a theme that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who was defense secretary under President Bush, have been hitting hard."]
["us", "''I was shocked and frankly deeply disappointed the other day when the president's spokesman attacked Dick Cheney because he dared to tell the truth about the state of readiness, and said he was attacking the military,'' Mr. Powell said. ''Dick Cheney has never attacked the military.'' Mr. Cheney pressed the same theme in appearances at military contractors in New England. He recalled a telephone call he had made to former President Ronald Reagan after the gulf war, saying he had thanked Mr. Reagan for the money his administration had spent on the military. ''I ask myself,'' he said, ''is anybody going to call Bill Clinton or Al Gore in the future to thank them for what they did to the U.S. military? I don't think so.'' The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, challenged several of the assertions Governor Bush made in his speeches today. Mr. Bacon said that the administration, along with Congress, had increased military spending by $150 billion over the next several years. That included an increase in spending on weapons and other equipment -- an area where Mr. Bush was sharply critical -- from $43 billion in 1998 to $60 billion today, as well as three straight years of pay raises. Mr. Bacon also noted that the number of troops qualifying for food stamps -- which Mr. Bush has often cited as evidence that the Clinton administration has neglected men and women in uniform -- had declined significantly."]
["us", "Mr. Bacon said that 19,400 service members, nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total, collected food stamps in 1991, when Mr. Bush's father was president and his running mate, Mr. Cheney, was secretary of defense. Today, Mr. Bacon said, 5,100 are on food stamps, or four-tenths of 1 percent of a smaller force."]
["world/europe", "Tensions Remain High in Crimea Amid Renewed Effort to Mediate - The New York Times MOSCOW \u2014  Even as Russia and Ukraine signaled a modest willingness to seek a diplomatic resolution to the widening crisis over Crimea on Saturday, there were new reports of Russian reinforcements there, and Russia raised the possibility of suspending inspections required under arms control treaties because of stepped-up operations by NATO. \u201cWe are ready to continue a dialogue on the understanding that a dialogue should be honest and partnerlike, without attempts to portray us as one of the parties in the conflict,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said during an appearance with his counterpart from Tajikistan. Hours after he spoke, however, Russia began moving new troops in unmarked uniforms in large trucks around Crimea, and a Ukrainian defense spokesman there said that witnesses had reported seeing amphibious military ships unloading about 200 military vehicles in eastern Crimea on Friday night after apparently having crossed the Strait of Kerch, which separates Crimea from Russian territory. The Ukrainian spokesman said that a convoy of about 60 military trucks was moving from Feodosiya toward an airfield near Simferopol, Crimea\u2019s regional capital. A Ukrainian border patrol plane was also fired on near the boundary between Crimea and Russia, the Ukrainians said, but was not damaged. In Moscow, an unidentified military official told Russian news agencies that Russia was considering suspending inspections of its strategic nuclear arsenal required by the arms reduction treaties, as well as other military cooperation accords meant to build confidence and avoid confrontations."]
["world/europe", "The official said the move was justified by \u201cbaseless threats\u201d against Russia by the United States and NATO. A suspension of the inspections would undermine a pillar of international security and expand the confrontation beyond Ukraine itself. Although President Obama has made it clear that the United States does not want to escalate the Crimean crisis, the Pentagon stepped up training operations in Poland and sent fighter jets to patrol the skies over Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, three former Soviet republics with sizable populations of ethnic Russians. Mr. Obama, who was spending the weekend in Florida, also held phone consultations about Ukraine with the French president and the British and Italian prime ministers, then had a conference call with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which are NATO members. He pledged that the United States, as a NATO ally, had an \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to their defense, according to the White House\u2019s account of the call. In a separate phone conversation on Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry warned Mr. Lavrov that \u201ccontinued military escalation and provocation in Crimea or elsewhere in Ukraine, along with steps to annex Crimea to Russia, would close any available space for diplomacy,\u201d a State Department official said. In Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s new foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsa, said that some small progress had been made to form a \u201ccontact group\u201d of foreign diplomats to mediate the country\u2019s confrontation with Russia after the occupation of Crimea by Russian soldiers and local \u201cself-defense\u201d groups more than a week ago. Washington has sought to establish the contact group, which would include Russia, Ukraine, Britain, France and the United States, as a way to bring Moscow and Kiev to the negotiating table."]
["world/europe", "Crimea\u2019s regional assembly voted on Thursday to secede from Ukraine and apply to join the Russian Federation, and scheduled a referendum for March 16 to ratify its decision, significantly escalating the crisis between Russia and the West. Ukraine, along with the United States and Europe, declared the referendum unconstitutional and made clear it would not recognize the vote, though the prospect of Crimea joining Russia received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from Russian lawmakers on Friday. \u201cWe have a certain small progress and some hope that we will manage this in a peaceful way,\u201d Mr. Deshchysta said in Kiev. \u201cWe need to create some negotiating mechanism\u201d with Russia, \u201cand we think it should be established as soon as possible.\u201d He said Ukraine was open to talks with Russia in any setting \u201cto stop the aggression and de-escalate the situation.\u201d But Mr. Lavrov did not budge from Russia\u2019s position that the new government in Ukraine was illegitimate and under the sway of \u201cradical nationalists\u201d who seized power in a coup. He insisted that any talks with Europe or the United States should begin with the agreement signed Feb. 21 between the ousted Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and opposition leaders, even though that accord fell apart almost immediately. The diplomacy is likely to be complicated, however, because Russian officials have refused to recognize Ukraine\u2019s new political leaders, though the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers have spoken and Mr. Deshchysta said that messages were being exchanged through intermediaries."]

The group, Right Sector, has not disbanded its quasi-military units, whose members now at times appear armed in public and have recently become more vocally critical of the interim government A day after declaring himself a candidate for president in the election now scheduled for May, the group\u2019s leader, Dmytro Yarosh, provided the most detailed description yet of his political ambitions and goals. Mr. Yarosh said the Right Sector was not disbanding because it wanted to dissuade Russia from moving deeper into Ukraine. \u201cUkraine is practically in a state of war with Russia,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is too early to speak of pacification and disarmament.\u201d In Crimea itself, tensions continued to mount. Poland evacuated its consulate in Sevastopol on Saturday \u201cbecause of continuing disturbances by Russian forces there,\u201d Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said.

The Associated Press reported that warning shots were fired at the observers when they tried again to cross into Crimea on Saturday. A day after Russia signaled that it was prepared to annex Crimea \u2014 despite a denial by President Vladimir V. Putin only days before \u2014 Mr. Deshchysta, the foreign minister, flatly declared that Ukraine would never agree. \u201cCrimea is and will remain a Ukrainian land,\u201d he said. After days of pro-Russian protests in Crimea, supporters of the new government in Kiev also rallied in Simferopol, confronting Russian demonstrators and volunteer militiamen.

It's what you say when caught red-handed with ''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls'' by someone who is rereading ''The Mill on the Floss.'' It's the justification for putting off quality time with Balzac and Flaubert in favor of the gustatory noodlings of Peter Mayle, whose vision of Gallic culture exists on a somewhat less exalted plane. ''The size of French appetites never fails to impress me,'' Mr. Mayle writes in his latest taste-bud travelogue, ''French Lessons,'' ''nor does the Frenchman's ability to absorb vast amounts of alcohol without falling headfirst into the cheese.'' ''Power! Sex! Money! Fame!'' trumpets the jacket flap on Jackie Collins's demurely red-lettered, leopard-print-covered latest, ''Hollywood Wives: The New Generation.'' This neatly identifies the four basic food groups of hot-weather reading, although food itself (\u00e0 la Mayle, a man who means a humongous truffle when he refers to a ''quarter-pounder'') and humor are two other staples. Put them all together and they spell reason to hate yourself in the morning after you have, for instance, eavesdropped on the close personal moments shared by the defrocked gossip columnist A. J.

["arts", "Now it is possible, as Richard Russo demonstrates so splendidly in ''Empire Falls,'' to write a great American novel that is also great fun to read. But on the page as on screen, there is a mysterious summertime phenomenon that large numbers of us seem to experience, one that activates the instinct to seek out -- to paraphrase one of Ms. Collins's very favorite characterizations -- rubbish. Amazon.com puts this notion much more pleasantly on a bookmark distributed with orders, one that says, ''Summer days call for light reading,'' a quotation attributed to Anonymous. That figures: nobody wants to own up to saying this, since everybody knows what it really means. But the confounding thing about light reading is that so much of it sinks like lead. Nothing could be less escapist than the beach book that leaves the reader feeling slimed or moves along like a piece of weary machinery. What can match the gloom of a bad book inside a bright, cheery-looking cover? And what could be more discouraging than a humor book without funny parts, unless it's that unfunny comedy can be wildly popular in spite of itself? George Carlin's best-selling ''Napalm & Silly Putty'' is chock-full of such observations as ''Somehow I enjoy watching people suffer'' and ''I'm curious, what precisely is Zsa Zsa Gabor's job title?'' Maybe this would make sense if the cover price of $22.95 brought Mr. Carlin himself, available to speak aloud comedy lines that curl up and die on the page."]
["arts", "Mr. Carlin, like Ms. Collins, seems to be lost in some kind of time warp, flashing back to the time when mentioning Zsa Zsa was funny and invoking Hollywood wives was hot stuff. But no amount of leopard-spotted cover art can put much spice into Ms. Collins's fiction these days, and it's not really her fault. Dishy as the original ''Hollywood Wives'' was in its time, this new book has an entire tabloid culture to compete with. And probably not even the wildest, naughtiest figments of Ms. Collins's imagination can match Russell Crowe on an off-day. So for up-to-date inspiration here, she turns to two siblings described as ''a younger, hipper version of the Farrelly brothers'' and seriously character-assassinates a very famous director resembling Steven Spielberg. His bad qualities are sexual inadequacy and always eating a plate of sliced papaya, banana and apple for breakfast. This prompts his wife to cheat, first with a young stud and then with a strong female director named Montana Gray. Thus, Ms. Collins can tell her readers that men in Hollywood are afraid of strong females, allowing one character to gaze unblinkingly at the groin of her kickboxing instructor by the book's fifth page, and deliver the occasional dialogue howler. (''I'm 19,'' she thought. ''I want wild uninhibited sex.'' But beyond this, she has surprisingly little up her sleeve."]
["arts", "Which is not to say that ''Hollywood Wives: The New Generation'' will not pass muster by beach book standards. If the scheming and seducing and back-stabbing to be found here seems awfully tame by, say, Motley Crue's standards (more about them in a moment), Ms. Collins's book does indulge in enough apparent gossip- and privilege-dropping to fill a beach book's quota. In the latter department, she sends a very famous platinum-blond singer to be the main attraction at the Desert Millennium Princess, where every last perk is described in loving detail. It's a wonder she doesn't bump into Stuart Woods's equally luxury-loving detective, Stone Barrington, there, but Stone is busy in Palm Beach. ''Cold Paradise,'' Mr. Woods's latest, installs Stone on a large yacht in the midst of an overplotted story as he helps out a software tycoon and runs into an old flame. Mr. Woods's last book in this series, ''L.A. Dead,'' was better plotted and came closer to big-ticket escapist perfection. If Marie Antoinette were vacationing in the Hamptons, Mr. Woods is probably the man she'd be reading."]

First of all, it is Cannie's good fortune to find herself promoted by extremely cute, bright, sexy, reader-friendly cover art, featuring pedicured toes and a piece of cake -- not a bad way of conjuring the desired state of mind. Second, in this amusing if sometimes strenuous story of a reporter's troubles with her kiss-and-telling ex-boyfriend, Cannie is befriended by a big movie star with the equally frisky name of Maxi. This is such a sunny book that it regards film stars as sweet, ready to make new friends, eager to read the new friends' screenplays, apt to leave considerate notes and kind enough to offer the use of their vehicles to Cannie -- including, in one case, a monthlong lease on a car. It is of course a far cry from such sweetness and light to the trademark misanthropy of Joe Queenan, whose latest witty tirade is entitled ''Balsamic Dreams,'' in homage to the baby boom generation. Mr. Queenan cites Sept. 24, 1987, as the date that ordinary guys began talking about balsamic vinegar. And for him it is of course one short and entertaining leap from such minor warning signs to major invective. Though David Brooks's ''Bobos in Paradise'' more than paved the way on this subject, Mr. Queenan still finds enough to work with. ''If the Greatest Generation was so great,'' he asks, ''how come they raised children like the baby boomers?''"]

The best chapter of his book rewrites American history to boomer tastes, with dialogue to match, as in: ''Speaking for the entire Lincoln family, I'd like to congratulate the Confederacy for taking things to another level.'' That replaces the Gettysburg Address. Bill Geist, another humorist, concentrates on a single subject, and it's one worthy of his talents: golf. ''It's not just for Republicans any more,''  Mr. Geist explains at the start of ''Fore! Play: The Last American Male Takes Up Golf,'' the title of which is self-explanatory. Calling golf ''bowling with landscaping,'' and calling his book '' 'one man's personal journey' so maybe I can attract a little interest from Oprah's Book Club,'' Mr. Geist investigates all corners of the golf universe. At a show of golf gear, he is on hand to question such statements as: ''To play golf well, you need good socks. It's as simple as that.'' High time somebody got tough about these things."]

Here on the page is what is liable to be one of next year's flashier high-tech thrillers, as a homicidal hacker goes on the rampage and a brilliant convict named Gillette is enlisted to track him down. This is the only thriller of Mr. Deaver's to require diagrams. And though it eventually becomes more formulaic than it was at its crackling good start, it's a big improvement over ''Speaking in Tongues,'' the author's grisly last one. Speaking of grisly, the former Daily News gossip columnist A. J. Benza offers a not-too-many-holds-barred autobiography in ''Fame: Ain't It a Bitch.'' And his account, noxious as it is at times (he and Mickey Rourke traded hoop earrings as a friendship gesture), does qualify as a guilty pleasure. After all, Mr. Benza is a guy who, when he met a porn actress whom he wildly admired, gushed, ''I just want to tell you, when I put in your videos I never fast-forward past anything you do.'' As for journalistic ethics, Mr. Benza could serve as a case study. ''I'm like crime,'' he used to say on the subject of free drinks and dinners. ''I don't pay.''"]

(No student of the beach-book genre should be without some awareness of Mr. Evans, it's true.) A fit of indignation about a book written by four call girls allowed Mr. Benza to show just what he stood for by having their publisher ejected from the party. This apparently endeared him to Mr. Evans and Warren Beatty, who were maligned in that kiss-and-tell. Said Mr. Evans: ''This guy is one of us, Warren. He's one of the guys.'' Said Mr. Beatty: ''I see that. I see.'' For Mr. Benza, it just doesn't get any better than that. Mr. Benza makes glancing, disparaging references to a onetime Newsday colleague, Anthony Scaduto, grousing that his co-worker has heart trouble and ought to die so that Mr. Benza could inherit his job. Sic transit gossip, if he means the same Anthony Scaduto who wrote an early tell-all biography of Bob Dylan, itself quite a beach book in its time.

And he has done some homework, not only in finding out about the singer's heretofore-secret marriage to one of his backup singers, but also in offering some sense of what Mr. Dylan's recent life has been like. It would be understandable if readers with eternal curiosity about Mr. Dylan should have absolutely no such interest in Motley Crue. And that's the beauty of ''The Dirt,'' that group's sleaze-and-dysfunction-packed new autobiography, written by the band members along with Neil Strauss, who writes about popular music for The New York Times: the less you know or care about them the better.

["sports/baseball", "Matt Harvey Quashes Uncertainty and the Nationals - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014  When Matt Harvey took the mound Thursday for his first professional baseball game in 593 days, he kicked at the dirt in front of the rubber, paced off four steps toward the plate and drew a straight line. Every time he threw a pitch, his left foot would land on, or somewhere near, the end of the line. Before each inning, he repeated the process. Then he would repeat his delivery, his foot landing in that sweet spot each time, with ease. Harvey had spent the last year and a half recovering from Tommy John surgery and waiting for this moment. The Mets and their fans had been waiting, too, wondering if their ace would return with the same dominance he had displayed before being injured. No one, not even Harvey, knew for certain if he would. Now they do know. In a commanding performance against the Nationals, Harvey threw six scoreless innings, allowed just four hits, struck out nine, walked one and got his first victory since a complete-game shutout of the Colorado Rockies on Aug. 7, 2013. In all, Harvey threw 91 pitches in the Mets\u2019 6-3 win, which is just about the workload the Mets wanted for him in his first game back. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said. Harvey said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could draw it up any better.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "As he worked toward this day in spring training, Harvey took comfort in the familiar parts of the game, the little things that made it feel routine, such as being around his teammates, taking fielding practice and landing his foot on that line. He had actually wanted to make his comeback last September, less than a year after his surgery, but the Mets held him back, hoping the extra time off would make him stronger. And in his exhibition-game outings last month, Harvey did look tough, throwing in the 90s, locating all his pitches for strikes, developing a better angle for his fastball and a tighter spin on his curve. He looked as good as ever, or maybe better. Amid these performances, his pitching coach, Dan Warthen, could not help but laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get better than before,\u201d he said. The only caveat was that spring training is not the same as a game that counts. So Thursday would be the real test, and Mets fans traveled here carrying Harvey signs and cutouts of his face. They wanted to see him for themselves. And Harvey did not disappoint. His first pitch was a 96-mile-per-hour fastball. He struck out his first batter, Michael Taylor, on a nasty curveball. Over Harvey\u2019s six innings, barely anyone hit him hard. Through his young career, Harvey has seemed fueled by moments like these. In his major league debut, he struck out 11. Early in his second year, he outdueled Stephen Strasburg, the Nationals ace. When he started the 2013 All-Star game, he struck out three batters in two innings."]
["sports/baseball", "The most electric moments Thursday came against Bryce Harper, the Nationals\u2019 best hitter. Harvey attacked him viciously and struck him out three times, each time with a fastball that Harper could not catch up with. The speed of those pitches: 97 m.p.h., 97 m.p.h., and 96 m.p.h. \u201cHe\u2019s like the big block bully,\u201d Manager Terry Collins said. Strasburg was the opposing starter on Thursday, and the Mets, with the help of an error by Ian Desmond, took a 4-0 lead in the second inning. They added two more runs in the sixth and then coasted to the victory. Harvey, meanwhile, faced real trouble just once, when the Nationals had runners on first and third with two outs in the second inning. He proceeded to buckle Jose Lobaton\u2019s knees with a 3-2 curveball to end the threat. Harvey finished his day nicely, too, striking out Clint Robinson, swinging. Harvey said afterward that he tried to concentrate on every pitch, something he said he may not have done well before he was hurt. \u201cFor me, it was really just being thankful for being out there, and compete, and not giving up any free passes, which is something I may have had trouble with in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think, now, especially, I\u2019m going to make those guys earn it.\u201d When Harvey left the mound after the sixth, he nodded toward Collins, a sign that he knew his day was done."]
["sports/baseball", "As the season progresses, the Mets will monitor his pitch counts and his innings carefully. There may be instances where Harvey is pulled from a game in which he has a shutout working. Arguments seem inevitable. Much of his rehabilitation, after all, was a tug of war between his desire to pitch as soon as possible and the Mets\u2019 insistence that he slow down. Alderson knows all this. He recognizes that Harvey is a player with both great talent and a good deal of bravado, which is just what the Mets need. \u201cHe talks the talk but he walks the walk,\u201d Alderson said outside the clubhouse after the game. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s a good combo. The talk provides some sizzle, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Alderson had one thing to add, but he waited until Harvey walked by. \u201cNice going, guy,\u201d he told him."]

George W. Bush accept an independent commission's schedule of debates, while Mr. Bush vowed to show up next week for a television debate he helped to set up regardless of whether Mr. Gore was there. ''I'm going to Washington, you bet,'' Mr. Bush said on NBC's ''Today'' show, in response to a question about his proposed debate on ''Meet the Press'' with Tim Russert on Tuesday at 10 p.m. Eastern daylight time. ''It's on my schedule. And I hope he's there. After all, it was on Mr. Russert's show, where he clearly said that he would show up if I showed up, and I'm showing up.'' But NBC officials said there would be no edition of ''Meet the Press'' on Tuesday if Mr. Gore was not on hand. ''Our offer of a debate has always been contingent upon acceptance by both candidates,'' said Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman. ''We have no interest in favoring one candidate or another.'' All the maneuvering has left the staging of any debates up in the air. The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has been running the candidate showdowns since 1988, has a longstanding invitation to both contenders to appear in three debates on college campuses in October, an offer Mr. Gore accepted months ago. On Sunday, Mr. Bush countered with his own  plan, which included one of the 90-minute commission debates but replaced the others with one-hour forums on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' next week and CNN's ''Larry King Live'' on Oct. 3."]
["us", "The commission has invited the campaigns to meet to settle their differences, but thus far only the Gore campaign has agreed to. Mr. Gore, who denounced Mr. Bush's offer as an effort to duck the commission debates because he was trying to limit the viewers, has said he is amenable to debating on the two programs. But he added that Mr. Bush must first consent to the commission's debates, which traditionally are broadcast live across the spectrum of major broadcast and cable news networks. But Mr. Bush's plan would make it impossible for the candidates to adhere to the commission's schedule, because the date for the proposed encounter on Mr. King's program -- Oct. 3 -- is the same as the first commission debate, at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Aides to Mr. Bush last week had expressed particular opposition to that debate, because of the university's proximity to the John F. Kennedy Library, an institution honoring a Democratic president. Asked whether CNN had been made a party, perhaps unwittingly, to efforts to scuttle the Boston debate, CNN said that it was the candidates who had the power over the schedule and that the Bush campaign itself chose the Oct. 3 date. ''They are in control of when and where they debate,'' said Christa Robinson, a CNN spokeswoman. ''What CNN did was put an offer on the table that did not have a specific date on it.'' But, she added that no debate would occur without Mr. Gore's participation."]
["us", "The degree to which Mr. Bush is pushing his counterproposal was underscored yesterday, when the Bush campaign introduced a new commercial taunting the vice president for not accepting Mr. Bush's debate plan. ''When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate 'anytime, anyplace, anywhere,' '' an announcer says, concluding, ''If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him on anything?'' The commercial drew an immediate condemnation from the Gore campaign, which contended that it was Mr. Bush who was practicing debate avoidance. ''It's just the latest act of political chicanery,'' said Chris Lehane, the Gore campaign press secretary. ''The bottom line is, he's bobbing and weaving and dodging by not putting the debates before the largest number of people possible.'' Mr. Bush's alternative plan drew complaints from other corners. Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee for president, sent letters to all the major cable and broadcast networks yesterday, asking that he be included in any debates they show. Mr. Nader wrote that the inclusion of him and the Reform Party candidate Patrick J. Buchanan would, among other things, make the debates more entertaining."]
["world", "Boutros-Ghali Angrily Condemns All Sides for Not Saving Rwanda - The New York Times Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed exasperation today at the refusal of most countries to send troops to Rwanda. He called the continuing slaughter there \"genocide\" and said it was a \"scandal\" that the world has not acted speedily to end the blood-letting. At a news conference in New York, the Secretary General described the United Nations efforts in Rwanda in harsh terms, saying: \"It is a failure not only for the United Nations; it is a failure for the international community. And all of us are responsible for this failure. Not only the great powers but the African powers, the nongovernmental organizations, all the international community. \"It is a genocide which has been committed. More than 200,000 people have been killed and the international community is still discussing what ought to be done.\" Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he had done all he could to persuade African governments to supply the 5,500 troops he wants to send to Rwanda to protect refugees and help aid workers. \"I have tried,\" he said, by writing to more than 30 heads of state after the United States and other Western countries made it clear they would not get involved. \"I begged them to send troops. I was in contact with different organizations and tried my best to be able to help them find a solution to the problem. \"Unfortunately, let us say with great humility, I failed. It is a scandal. I am the first one to say it.\""]
["world", "The Secretary General placed the blame on \"donor fatigue\" among countries that frequently assign troops to the United Nations but now find themselves being asked to support 17 such operations with personnel and money. In Annapolis, Md., today, President Clinton listed Rwanda among the world's many bloody conflicts where the interests at stake did not justify the use of American military power. \"We cannot solve every such outburst of civil strife or militant nationalism simply by sending in our forces,\" Mr. Clinton said in a commencement address at the United States Naval Academy. At an emergency meeting today in Geneva, the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted unanimously to send an investigator to Rwanda, who is to report back within four weeks. It also called for \"human rights field officers\" to be stationed in Rwanda to deter abuses. In Kigali, the capital, the army and the forces of the Rwanda Patriotic Front battled today for control, trading artillery and mortar fire that killed two people at a Red Cross hospital and ended Tuesday's brief truce. A United Nations envoy, Iqbal Riza, drove through the fighting in an armored car to confer with Government ministers, who have fled to Gitarama, 35 miles from Kigali. The renewed fighting has stopped deliveries of food and water to all but 3,000 of the 12,500 refugees under United Nations protection at 11 sites in Kigali. Nearly half the refugees are children."]
["world", "Roger Carter, of the United Nations Children Fund, said in Nairobi, Kenya: \"As the siege of Kigali goes on, the situation is going to get worse. In the next few days you are going to see malnutrition in Kigali.\" 3 Nations Pledge Troops So far the United Nations has received firm pledges from Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal for about 2,000 of the 5,500 troops it wants for Rwanda. The United Nations is asking Western nations for equipment for the African troops and has asked Australia for soldiers specialized in logistics. Mr. Boutros-Ghali indicated today that he still hopes Egypt, Nigeria and Zimbabwe will provide soldiers. Although Italy has said it is ready to send troops to Rwanda, no firm offer has been received, he said. His display of near despair over Rwanda was not the first time Mr. Boutros-Ghali had appealed emotionally for troops to rescue a country degenerating into chaos. Two years ago, he helped push the Bush Administration into sending troops to Somalia after contrasting the world's indifference toward the catastrophe there with its extensive effort to halt the fighting in Yugoslavia, which he described then as \"a rich man's war.\" African diplomats say most countries are shying away from offering soldiers because of the obvious dangers. But they are other inhibitions.  Problems of Their Own Nigeria and several West African countries have already sent peacekeeping forces to Liberia. And East and Central African countries generally have small, poorly equipped armies or are consumed by civil war themselves. Newly democratic South Africa has a large, modern army but apparently has not been approached."]
["world", "Furthermore, few African countries can afford the cost, especially when the United Nations' own financial difficulties are delaying reimbursements to nations contributing troops. The Secretary General emphasized that the troops he wants to send to Rwanda cannot impose a solution, but he said a large United Nations force could \"contain\" the deteriorating situation and \"reinforce\" the position of his mediator there. \"They may help protect both Tutsi and Hutu,\" he explained. \"But the mandate is limited so it is not our intention to impose on the protagonists of the dispute a certain formula.\" When last year's peace agreement collapsed on April 7 and fierce fighting broke out between Hutu and Tutsi, the United Nations cut its 2,500-member force in Rwanda back to a few hundred at the urging of the Clinton Administration. As the killing got worse, the Secretary General backed African calls for a new, larger force to be sent in. But the Administration, which had just set tight guidelines for supporting new peacekeeping operations, successfully opposed doing more than restoring earlier cuts until certain conditions are met. These conditions include progress toward a cease-fire, a firm schedule for ending the operation and agreement that the emphasis should be on protecting refugees along the borders rather than sending troops into Kigali, as the Secretary General favors."]
["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICAN RUNNING MATE; Cheney More Generous by His Own Numbers - The New York Times Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, today defended his charitable contributions as ''appropriate'' and insisted he should be given credit not only for direct contributions but also for speaking fees he directed to charity and for corporate gifts that matched his own donations. Answering reporters' questions on a campaign flight from Washington, Mr. Cheney challenged the suggestion that his generosity should be measured by comparing his direct contributions of $209,832 over the last 10 years to his income of $20,677,742, a standard by which he gave 1.01 percent of his income. He also counted $89,500 in speaking fees and $142,820 in matching gifts. Neither is a charitable contribution under the federal tax laws. ''About four hundred forty-some thousand dollars were directed to charity, either direct contributions or honorariums or matching funds from the boards that we sat on,'' he said. ''I thought that was appropriate.'' By his measure, that would equal 2.14 percent of his income. Asked if he considered that level ''generous,'' Mr. Cheney replied, ''I answered your question.'' When a reporter, noting that he is a multimillionaire, asked him, ''What do you think is a proper level of giving for someone who has millions of dollars, in terms of percentage?'' he replied: ''I think that's a choice that individuals have to make in terms of what they want to do with their resources. It's not a policy question. It's a private matter. It's a matter of private choice.''"]
["us", "According to the Internal Revenue Service, average taxpayers give about 2 percent of their income to charity. In 1997, the last year for which figures are available, those with incomes of $1 million or more gave an average of 4.5 percent. The last year that the income of Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, was below $2 million was 1992, when he was secretary of defense and they earned $258,394. Later today, an aide explained that Mr. Cheney's first concern when he started making a lot of money in the private sector was providing for his children and grandchildren, and that the $442,152 represented only the start of substantial lifetime contributions he expected to make to charity. Mr. Cheney, who last week released the first two pages of his tax returns for each of the last 10 years, but not the full returns, said he and his wife had decided not to identify the charities they had given money to. He said, ''It was everything from the United Way to Capital Partners for Education in Washington, which provides scholarships for inner-city kids to go to parochial school, and a whole range of things in between.'' Mr. Cheney said he had rejected a chance to have $3.5 million worth of stock options in the Halliburton Company vest before the election because ''that is traditionally not the way we do business at Halliburton.''"]

["science", "Find an Ice Flower Before It Melts - The New York Times After unseasonably warm weather, some parts of the country are expected to be blasted by winter storms over the coming weeks. There may be a tiny, fleeting bright side for those who live in places where something known as frostweed grows: ice flowers. It blossoms in the middle of the night, when the air is just at freezing and the ground is warm \u2014 at least relative to the air. As supercool water seeps out from the cracks of a plant stem, the surrounding air transforms the liquid to ice by a slow, steady process, as you can see in this time-lapse photography taken by Forrest M. Mims III, an amateur scientist and author, in the woods near his Texas home in January 2004. The growing ice swirls into rounded ribbons that ripple and fold like petals. If you pick it up, it may shatter. And if you wake up too late, it\u2019s as if it were never even there. In the last couple of weeks, #frostflowers, as they are more commonly referred to on social media, have been photographed in Tennessee and Kentucky. The blooms have also been documented in Alabama, Texas, Indiana and Pennsylvania over the years.  Jim Carter, a retired geographer at Illinois State University, has even grown them in his yard in Illinois. He first stumbled upon one of these curious ice creations in East Tennessee in 2003, not knowing what it was."]
["science", "Ever since, he has been working to understand not only this fleeting blossom, but also other strange ice formations such as needle ice, which grows from soil and hair ice, which grows from fungus-infested wood. What he has found is that they are all formed by a process called ice segregation \u2014 a process similar to the one that turns a Coke that has been sitting in a cooler of ice from liquid to slush just as you crack it open. At the most basic level, a garden requires the presence of certain plants \u2014 such as frostweed \u2014 and the freezing of supercold water from the soil at just the right rate. The plant, he explains, pulls water up from the ground. The water then leaks out and hits frost, which causes it to start freezing. A delicate temperature balance is essential to keep the ice growing. It stops unfurling only when the balance is broken, which is inevitable sooner or later. \u201cYou get a nice sunny day, and it doesn\u2019t take long before the sun hits it, and it all sort of wilts and goes away,\u201d Dr. Carter said."]

["travel", "TRAVELING SMART; On Beaten Paths or Off, There's a Guide to Get You There - The New York Times DANTE counted on Virgil, and Everyman had a useful chum called Knowledge, who promised, ''Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide.'' Christian in ''Pilgrim's Progress'' relied on Evangelist for advice on where to go next. Let's face it, every traveler needs a guide. What Baedeker was to the 19th century, Frommer's and Fodor's were to the mid-20th, and the choice widens every year. I get inordinately attached to my guidebooks, even the less-than-congenial ones. I seem unable to part with any of them, beginning with the Fodor's guide to Germany that accompanied me on my honeymoon in 1966 and Frommer's ''England on $5 and $10 a Day'' from 1969 (currently ''$85 a Day''). Looking at my collection can summon memories of some strange little byway, comic mishap in a bed-and-breakfast, a treasure I would never have glimpsed on my own. Part of the adventure of any trip is the developing relationship with a guide -- resisting, trusting, admiring, feeling betrayed. Usually one book is not enough for any trip longer than an extended weekend, and their differing personalities emerge as we tour, say, Hanoi together. One guidebook will remind me of a hypercautious uncle; another an infectiously enthusiastic, but not always terribly discriminating, college roommate."]
["travel", "When new to a series, I often look at the suggestions for further reading. A healthy selection of novels and personal views of a country, rather than more standard works of nonfiction, makes me feel a guide and I will be compatible. My well-traveled daughter, who is 29, uses another measuring stick: she looks at a volume that covers her town, or one she knows well, to get a sense of a guidebook's savvy. While I have certainly had memorable trips inspired by one-shot guides, the big series have a reassuring reach and track record. Here is a personal guide to some of the best-known guidebooks: FODOR'S -- People tend to think of Fodor's and Frommer's as they do the big hotel  chains -- mainstream, middle-of-the-road Old Reliables. But Fodor's is pitched a few notches higher than Frommer's, aimed at a fairly discerning traveler with an appetite for background and the occasional surprise. When Fodor's and I traveled to Philadelphia together, for instance, I appreciated its realistic account of the city's crime and the flight to the suburbs. A regular feature, ''Off the Beaten Track,'' supplied quirky places, including Bryn Athyn, a glorious suburban cathedral built according to the medieval guild system. Among Fodor's near-standard features is the ''Time Out,'' which offers suggestions for food and drink on a walking tour; sections devoted to children's attractions and free sights; and thoughtful shopping recommendations. Sights are organized according to neighborhood walking tours, with additional sights listed by categories (historical buildings, zoos, libraries)."]
["travel", "And, almost always a good omen in a guidebook, the authors of different sections are identified and described. Fodor's, with 440 guides updated usually every year, hires  high-end journalists who live in the destinations; it also commissions or reprints essays by writers like Paul Fussell, Frances Mayes and Peter Mayle. FROMMER'S -- More breezy and less thorough than Fodor's, Frommer's is given to unattractive boldfaces and bullet-style info-bits of dubious value (in the ''Did You Know?'' section: ''A Spaniard, Josep Grugu\u00e8s, cooked the world's largest sausage, measuring three miles long''). Writers of the travel-writing ilk get only brief identifications. Nobody would claim that Frommer's, with about 250 titles, offers more than a greatest-hits approach to history and culture, but virtues include good walking-tour maps and charts (metric and clothing-size conversions, city-to-city distances) as well as canny suggestions for reading and listening to music before you go. Major guides are revised yearly, others every two years.  Frommer's will also get you reasonably fed and housed and point out the most obvious sights. When I traveled to Segovia with Frommer's guide to Spain, for example, it led me to the charming, old-fashioned Gran Hotel las Sirenas, on the town's prettiest plaza, and a restaurant, El Bernardino, which was a bit touristy but good value. But after absorbing the six, cursorily described sights in the guide, the traveler who wants anything more in-depth in Segovia will have to go elsewhere."]
["travel", "MICHELIN GREEN GUIDES -- Elsewhere, in the case of Segovia, meant Michelin's tall, slim guide devoted to Spain's cultural and historical sights. (The newest Green Guides are adding what the publishers describe as highly selective recommendations for hotels and restaurants, but for more complete listings, see the Red Guides.) Michelin's focus means much more information about Segovia's history as a medieval wool town and its Romanesque architecture. Two tours of this small but rich town, detailing more than 18 sights, are designed for a traveler who is more curious, sophisticated and persistent than those in Frommer's market. The less ambitious traveler will find Michelin dry and demanding. On the other hand, reading a Green Guide in a cafe or a bar is an excellent way to meet kindred spirits all over Europe. (There are also Green Guides for North America and one for Thailand, the guide's first in Asia.) The exception to the rule that authored guides are a good sign, the Green Guides are magisterial in their anonymity. Michelin describes its authors as scholarly and expert, not a claim many readers would dispute. While it can be hard to assess other guides' one-note enthusiasm, the Michelin star system efficiently classifies sights as ''interesting'' to ''worth a journey.'' The books are also lightweight, the introductory sections are sage and the population figures for each town are helpful. (For me, the difference between a town of 150,000 and 15,000 is crucial, facts often missing in guides.) Although the guides are updated every two years, they stay relevant for generations: barring disaster, Segovia's  Romanesque churches endure."]
["travel", "LONELY PLANET -- Founded in the 1970's for the young, impecunious and adventurous traveler in Asia, Lonely Planet has expanded to about 600 titles, which are revised every two to three years (Web updates at  www.lonelyplanet.com). Their forte, coping with the practicalities of some daunting destinations -- communications, getting from place to place, the Internet, toilets, customs and taboos -- has earned the guides a following that includes older, more prosperous but still intrepid travelers. Lonely Planet, which is based in Australia, can pile on the health and legal warnings so high that some call the series Forbidden Planet, but if you want to know about the risk of dengue fever or the caliber of the local police, this is the guide that spells it all out (and suggests remedies). Lonely Planet writers tend to be youngish and politically or ecologically committed,  with a long-term interest in the destination (and can be actual residents). As with any series written by different authors, the titles will evoke various reactions. I got along well with the author of Mexico City (John Noble) and the writer of Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands (Deanna Swaney). Her coverage of the Icelandic music scene was thin, but she made up for it with attention to local foods and flora and fauna. I never hit it off with the authors of the 1995 Vietnam guide (Robert Storey and Daniel Robinson): their introductions on history, culture and religion struck me as heavy-going, and they often seemed oblivious to the charm or zaniness of certain sights."]
["travel", "Trying to keep faith with its backpacking  beginnings, Lonely Planet can err on the cheese-paring side. My daughter describes it as ''the guide for people not prepared to spend an extra dollar for something 10 times better'' -- an exaggeration with a grain of truth. Excellent for touring on a shoestring, Lonely Planet is less reliable when it ventures outside its niche. THE ROUGH GUIDES -- Designed, like Lonely Planet, for a resourceful and independent-minded clientele, the Rough Guides number 140 titles, including the Mini Rough Guides to large cities. For my money, they are more open-minded and readable than Lonely Planet. The background material, placed at the end of the book, is impressively researched and consistently thought provoking. A section on Vietnam in the movies, for example, is a surprisingly complete minihistory that begins in 1932 with Jean Harlow in ''Red Dust.'' An essay on wildlife and the environment in the China guide similarly inspires  confidence. Not a surprise -- the writers of that volume have a sustained interest in Mandarin Chinese and China; their expertise is typical of the Rough Guide. Putting sights in context, an essential in a guidebook, is probably the Rough Guide's strongest point. When you visit Hanoi's History Museum with the Rough Guide, you learn about the building's architectural m\u00e9lange of Vietnamese palace and French villa (neo-Vietnamese) and the exhibitions. At Ho Chi Minh's Museum, built as a hagiographic exercise with Soviet aid, the 1996 guide offers a reassuring minicritique: ''Go in for the surreal nature of the whole experience, but don't expect to come away having learnt much more about Ho Chi Minh.'' Even in the limited space of a small-format guide to Tokyo, the section on restaurants and bars has sidebars with essential vocabulary, eating and drinking etiquette and ''The Way of Tea.''"]
["travel", "The books are revised every two years, except for the Europe guide, which is updated annually. INSIGHT GUIDES -- Lushly designed with heavy paper and brilliant photography, Insight Guides could ravish armchair travelers and  real ones. This London-based series is strong on conveying the character of a place, with essays like ''The Samurai Way of Dying'' (Tokyo). Expect quirky, insider details from their writers, who are often specialists. Information is timely, with updates for the most popular destinations made when the book goes back to press, sometimes more than once a year. These guides, which address a self-reliant, worldly traveler, also tend to be more impressionistic than systematic, but their hints can be fruitful. A few mentions in the Glasgow guide of a 19th-century architect named Alexander (Greek) Thomson intrigued me enough to locate a map of his buildings at the Tourist Board and visit his bizarre designs. The listings of restaurants and hotels, however, are much sketchier than the books' treatment of neighborhoods, museums and sites. You really need another  source for food and lodging if you are going to spend more than a few days with an Insight Guide. And they are heavy. But those evocative photographs whose weight you rued while traveling become a smashing souvenir album once you are home. Just one glance at a particular picture in Glasgow -- the wrought-iron railings of the Great Western Terrace on a snowy day -- transports me back to a splendid trip."]

["world/europe", "Sovereignty vs. Self-Rule: Crimea Reignites Battle - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014  They wanted to break away from a country they considered hostile. The central government cried foul, calling it a violation of international law. But with the help of a powerful foreign military, they succeeded in severing ties. The Kosovars\u2019 secession from Serbia in 1999 drove a deep wedge between the United States and Russia that soured relations for years. Washington supported Kosovo\u2019s bid for independence, culminating in 2008, while Moscow saw it as an infringement of Serbia\u2019s sovereignty. Now 15 years later, the former Cold War rivals again find themselves at odds, but this time they have effectively switched sides: Russia loudly proclaims Crimea\u2019s right to break off from Ukraine while the United States calls it illegitimate. The showdown in Ukraine has revived a centuries-old debate over the right of self-determination versus the territorial integrity of nation-states. The clash in Crimea is hardly an exact parallel of the Kosovo episode, especially with Russian troops occupying the peninsula as it calls a March 16 referendum to dissolve ties with Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Though the United States intervened militarily in Kosovo, it did not do so to take the territory for itself. But the current case underscores once again that for all of the articulation of grand principles, the acceptability of regions breaking away often depends on the circumstances. Consider the different American views of recent bids for independence. Chechnya? No. East Timor? Yes. Abkhazia? No."]
["world/europe", "South Sudan? Yes. Palestine? It\u2019s complicated. It is an acutely delicate subject in the West, where Britain wants to keep Scotland and Spain wants to keep Catalonia.

The young American union later fought a civil war to keep the South from breaking away. Even today, there is occasional fringe talk of secession in Texas. \u201cNo state has been consistent in its application of this,\u201d said Samuel Charap, a Russia specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. During a trip he took to Moscow last week, Mr. Charap said, Kosovo was the precedent cited repeatedly by Russians defending the Crimea intervention. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018You guys do the same thing.

["world/europe", "While the concept of state sovereignty can be traced to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the issue has been especially tricky for American presidents in the quarter century since the end of the Cold War. Ukraine itself is the product of a breakup, that of the Soviet Union, when 15 separate nations emerged from the wreckage. Several of those new nations then confronted their own separatist movements, notably Chechnya in Russia; Transnistria in Moldova; Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia; and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Although Woodrow Wilson championed self-determination after World War I, the United States like most powers generally prefers stability and the status quo, so it has largely supported preserving borders where they are. During the first Russian war in Chechnya, Bill Clinton even likened Boris N. Yeltsin to Abraham Lincoln, a comparison many in Washington came to regret amid the carpet bombing of Grozny, the Chechen capital. \u201cSelf-determination has been a controversial doctrine since Wilson, and hell to apply,\u201d said Stephen Sestanovich, a former ambassador at large to the Soviet states and the author of a new book, \u201cMaximalist,\u201d on American foreign policy. \u201cOne consistent point: It can\u2019t be used as a cudgel by big states to break up their neighbors. Russia\u2019s own record here does not entitle it to the benefit of the doubt.\u201d Russia\u2019s two ferocious wars in Chechnya since the 1990s were fought to prevent the very strain of separatism it now encourages in Crimea. In backing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in his civil war against rebels, Russia argues that state sovereignty should not be violated, an argument it has turned on its head in Ukraine."]
["world/europe", "Of course, the fractiousness that has chopped up the Soviet empire into increasingly smaller and often dysfunctional pieces is not relegated only to that part of the world, although in the West in recent years it has played through political and legal processes rather than military ones. In September, for example, Scotland will hold a referendum on secession, a vote being held with the acquiescence of London. In November, Catalonia plans its own vote on independence from Spain, although in that case the Madrid government has called it illegal. Quebec held unsuccessful referendums on independence from Canada in 1980 and 1995 and as recently as last week its separatist government was discussing whether another should be held. But Kosovo is the case that deeply divided Europe. After Yugoslavia fell apart, the Kosovo Liberation Army, a rebel group representing the Albanian minority, struggled against the Serbian government, which responded with punishing force until Mr. Clinton intervened in 1999 with a 78-day NATO bombing campaign. Kosovo declared independence in 2008. The United States under George W. Bush recognized it, as did Britain, France and Germany, but Russia adamantly rejected it, as did Spain. The International Court of Justice later ruled that Kosovo\u2019s declaration was legal. \u201cWe never saw it as setting a precedent, but there were some nations that saw it that way and still do,\u201d said James W. Pardew, who was Mr. Clinton\u2019s special representative for the Balkans.\u00a0"]

Ever since, Russia has cited Kosovo to justify support for pro-Moscow separatist republics in places like Georgia, where it went to war in 2008 and recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia over Western objections. \u201cKosovo is very much a legitimate precedent,\u201d said Dimitri K.

Watanabe, a skinny Japanese forward, just needed to work on his panache. \u201cWe told him to find a new celebration because the one he had wasn\u2019t cutting it,\u201d said Kevin Larsen, a junior who grew up in Copenhagen. \u201cHe was, like, jumping in the air making a weird face. So we tried to help him find a new one.\u201d Watanabe, from Miki, a small town in the Kagawa prefecture in Japan, is proving to be a quick learner as he navigates through his freshman year at George Washington and his second year in the United States. During a game against Saint Louis earlier this month, Watanabe made a key 3-pointer midway through the second half to give the Colonials a 52-49 lead, capping a 13-0 run. While running back on defense, Watanabe lifted three fingers on his right hand and repeatedly pointed to his head, mimicking Carmelo Anthony\u2019s \u201cthree to the dome\u201d celebration. \u201cI like when guys show emotion,\u201d George Washington Coach Mike Lonergan said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to show up the other team, but when he hits a big shot, he really feels good. I\u2019ll let him go because it\u2019s all innocent. He\u2019s having fun.\u201d"]
["sports", "Game-changing plays are becoming common for Watanabe, who is believed to be the third Japanese-born player to earn a Division I basketball scholarship. The 6-foot-8 Watanabe has quickly become an instrumental player in George Washington\u2019s rotation as the Colonials (14-4, 4-1) aim for an Atlantic 10 title, as well as consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament berths for the first time since 2006 and 2007. \u201cHe lives for the big moments,\u201d Lonergan said. \u201cHe keeps his composure more than our upperclassmen. He really is a starter for us. I like to start seniors. With Yuta, we have scoring off the bench. If I start Yuta, we have no scoring off the bench at all.\u201d Watanabe, 20, is usually George Washington\u2019s sixth man, but he is regularly on the floor at the end of the game. Against St. Louis, Watanabe blocked a game-tying 3-point attempt by Mike Crawford at the buzzer to seal a 75-72 win. Watanabe is averaging 8.0 points a game and shooting 83.8 percent from the free-throw line. Recently, he has been attempting the team\u2019s technical foul shots, a duty Lonergan said he would normally never give a freshman. But it is not free throws that have made Watanabe one of the most popular students on campus. When Watanabe connects on one of his momentum-building 3-pointers or follows the ball to the rim for a putback dunk, the home crowd at George Washington\u2019s Charles E. Smith Center often reacts in hysterics, following with chants of \u201cYu-ta! Yu-ta!\u201d"]
["sports", "The sight of an Asian player having such an integral role in a college team\u2019s success is rare. Including Watanabe, only four Japanese-born players have competed for Division I teams. In 2013, The Japan Times labeled Watanabe \u201cThe Chosen One.\u201d \u201cTo see someone of Asian descent, and play as well as he does, it\u2019s cool for college basketball, really cool for the Asian community,\u201d said Richmond guard Zach Chu, who is half-Chinese. Last week, Chu watched Watanabe up close as his team fell to George Washington, 73-70, in double overtime. Watanabe said he hoped to inspire Japanese players to believe they could compete at the highest level of American college ball. \u201cJapanese are thinking Americans are bigger and taller and more athletic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are thinking it\u2019s more difficult for Japanese to play in N.C.A.A., but I\u2019m playing right now, so I want to make other people come to the United States.\u201d K. J. Matsui, who played for Columbia from 2005 to 2009, played with Watanabe on Japan\u2019s national team. He said Watanabe is popular among Japanese basketball fans. Japan is second behind the United States in supplying web traffic to George Washington\u2019s athletics site this season. Watanabe\u2019s level of notoriety in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood is also rising. Walking around George Washington\u2019s campus, it is not uncommon for students to stop Watanabe and congratulate him on his play."]

Still, even with the globalization of the game during the past two decades, Watanabe is in a rare position. Of the 5,493 Division I men\u2019s basketball players in 2013-14, only 15 identified themselves as Asian. While attending Harvard, Lin said he struggled with attention being centered on his ethnicity, rather than his performance. \u201cIt was irritating at times,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think more so than anything else, it showed me how unready society was \u2014 how unused to Asian-American basketball players they were, because of the amount of attention I was getting for being a skin color versus what I was doing on the court.\u201d During his career, opposing fans have mocked Lin\u2019s race. Yuki Togashi, who plays for the N.B.A. Development League\u2019s Texas Legends, and Matsui said that during their time playing in the United States, fans taunted them by calling them Jackie Chan or Yao Ming, both of whom are Chinese, not Japanese. On the road, Watanabe said he had yet to face hostility from opposing crowds. \u201cIf I did, if they said something racist, I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.

Watanabe\u2019s parents have yet to see him play in person in the United States, but his teammates\u2019 parents have invited him to their houses for meals and during the holidays. Watanabe arrived in the United States in November 2013 to attend St. Thomas More prep school in Oakdale, Conn., after American coaches in Japan saw him play for the national team and suggested he play a year of prep school to gain notice. Watanabe\u2019s English is also steadily improving. On the court, there are times when Lonergan will often go right up to Watanabe to explain a play or a mistake during a previous possession. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any language barrier,\u201d Watanabe said. This season, Watanabe said his goals were to help George Washington, which plays at Fordham on Thursday, win a conference title and make the N.C.A.A. tournament.

["world/europe", "U.S. and E.U. Confer on Possible Laptop Ban on Trans-Atlantic Flights - The New York Times BRUSSELS \u2014 American and European officials met on Wednesday in Brussels to discuss aviation security after the United States Department of Homeland Security said it was considering a ban on laptop computers and tablets in the cabins of trans-Atlantic flights. The session, between Elaine C. Duke, the deputy secretary of homeland security, and representatives of various European Union countries and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive body, was called after the Europeans asked for clarification about any new restrictions \u2014 and the terrorist threats that prompted them. A senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting said that certain European officials were given insight into a developing aviation security threat. Terrorist groups, the official said, were pursuing various innovations, including putting explosives in consumer devices. The official added that the homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly, could impose the measure in the next several days or weeks. A senior European Union official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed that the Americans shared information about what was behind the reports about the proposed restrictions. In March, the United States and Britain barred passengers traveling through airports in a number of Muslim-majority countries from carrying laptop computers, tablets and other devices larger than cellphones aboard direct inbound flights. The larger items were to be stowed with checked luggage."]
["world/europe", "Officials said the restrictions were put in place after intelligence showed that the Islamic State was developing a bomb that could be hidden in portable electronic devices. In Europe, however, there is a deep wariness that extending the restrictions there would create vast complications for airports and airlines on one of the busiest corridors for international air travel. Last year, 31 million passengers departed European airports on flights to the United States, and 3.5 million of those passengers connected from flights that originated outside of Europe, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group representing 265 airlines. Some companies restrict their employees from checking laptop computers as stowed luggage to prevent sensitive business information being lost or stolen. And some aviation experts say that storing so many electronics in an airplane\u2019s hold could heighten the risk of lithium-ion batteries catching fire. On Tuesday, Alexandre de Juniac, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, advised European and American officials to \u201cavoid the concentration of lithium battery-powered devices in the cargo hold of passenger aircraft.\u201d In a letter to Mr. Kelly and Violeta Bulc, the European commissioner for transportation, Mr. de Juniac said the current American prohibition of large electronic devices on flights from countries in the Middle East and North Africa affected about 50 flights each day; extending the ban to Europe would affect a further 390 flights per day and cost passengers $1.1 billion each year, mostly because of longer travel times and the inability of passengers to work during flights."]
["world/europe", "Mr. de Juniac suggested there were alternatives to expanding the laptop ban, including the greater use of detection systems to test whether people had handled explosives; asking passengers to turn on their devices to detect possible tampering; using more trained dogs to sniff out explosives on passengers; and using programs to detect low-risk travelers. According to a joint statement released after the Brussels meeting, the Americans and the Europeans plan to meet next week in Washington to discuss technical issues."]
["movies", "Five Questions for John Crowley - The New York Times This interview initially ran as part of coverage for the New York Film Festival. In the period drama \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d a young woman Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) immigrates to the New York City borough of the title in the 1950s from a small town in Ireland. Her struggles and discoveries are chronicled as she begins to feel more at home in unfamiliar territory. The Times critic A. O. Scott wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet, observant movie, with an aversion to melodrama and a sense of the ordinary.\u201d The film\u2019s screenplay is by Nick Hornby, based on the novel by Colm Toibin. And its Irish director, John Crowley, has a background in theater and brought some of those skills to this film. In an interview during the New York Film Festival, Mr. Crowley discussed what drew him to \u201cBrooklyn\u201d and how he went about recreating the period. Here are excerpts from that conversation. Q. Is this your first time at the New York Film Festival? A. Yes. I usually haven\u2019t been in New York this time of year. I directed a bunch of plays on Broadway. That\u2019s the only length of time I\u2019ve spent here. We shot for two days when we were making \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d one day on a brownstone street and one day out at Coney Island. You only shot two days in Brooklyn for a film called \u201cBrooklyn\u201d?"]
["movies", "I\u2019m afraid so. Budget considerations. It\u2019s that thing of being a film of a certain level of budget that means you get punished from all sides. It\u2019s not a super low budget, nor is it a studio-sized budget. So we had to go to Montreal to shoot a lot of the interiors, which made sense. But Montreal was a good match for a couple of our exteriors. What drew you to make this film? I think it\u2019s a profoundly important story, not just about Irish history and Irish culture, but about the niche of the relationship between Europe and America in the 20th century. It\u2019s a very small story which I hope has scale to it. I immigrated when I was in my late 20s to London to direct plays. I immigrated happily and successfully to carry on my directing career. But I was very struck by how this long arm of homesickness still affects you. And it\u2019s not just missing home, it\u2019s what happens when you leave home. You\u2019re not from the homeland that you\u2019ve chosen to live in. But when you go back home again, you\u2019re not from there either anymore. And that\u2019s confusing and it makes you feel rootless. You become an exile. That\u2019s a universal condition that\u2019s delicately articulated in the book. All of that was stuff that I felt I had emotional understanding from experience that could maybe help make this film not a period piece frozen in aspic, but could give it a directness that would resonate with a younger audience anywhere."]
["movies", "How did you go about recreating this period of Brooklyn, like the Irish boardinghouse where Eilis resides? We started with a vast number of photographs from the period and tried to identify the feeling that would have been in those houses at the time. Irish boardinghouses we didn\u2019t find any photographic reference of. So we had to conjecture from different sources, trying to get the economic feeling of it. We wanted to create a version of the early \u201950s before the economic engine kicked off and just before pop culture began to rumble through. We wanted to let that filter into the film in a selective fashion. What was your biggest challenge during your shoot? The scene that was tricky to film in a way that was free of clich\u00e9 was the sex scene. I wanted to figure out how to do that from the point of view that didn\u2019t objectify the action and make it titillating, but rather try to find a way of it feeling like the very first time these two people had actually made love and the strangeness of the sensation for Ellis in the middle of that. To try to find that without allowing the necessity of repetition on a film set to drain it of any spontaneity, that\u2019s a tough thing to achieve."]
["living", "SIPS; Cool Is Better Than Numb - The New York Times IT was a mildly warm afternoon, one of the last before we drop off into the three-month inferno. I was sitting at the bar at Pastis, and ordered a Sazerac. The barman muddled wedges of lemon with pink Peychaud bitters and sugar. He scooped ice into the glass; poured over bourbon; shook it so quickly his arm was a blur, shattering the ice into flinty pieces; and strained the drink into a Pernod-stained glass. It was a great drink, sharp and sweet, with a stiff kick punctuating each sip. But even in the gentle heat of that day, it just wouldn't do. Halfway through, I pleaded for a glass of water. A summer drink should be fleeting, not sustaining. It should slake your palate, cool you off and give you a whiff of alcohol without knocking you off your feet. Many bartenders believe that adding some fruit juice and a few ice cubes will do the trick. You can gulp down strawberry martinis and boozy punches until you no longer remember your name. (It doesn't take long.) But at some restaurants, the cooks have collaborated with the bartenders to create drinks that have dimension and character -- flavor rather than thunder. You can sip, guess at the drink's potions while it sweats in the heat and order another without slurring."]
["living", "The deep-purple spritzer at Five Points is assertive and cryptic. You taste dark, sweet blackberries. It is tart, too, and effervescent. That's the Champagne. But then it tastes somehow minty and herbal. Bay leaves. You think you've solved it, but there's an infusion of rosemary as well. The drink is sweet without being syrupy, herbal without feeling like mint tea. The flavors flood your palate and then depart. You get a similar effect from the strawberry mint julep at Sono. Vicky Eng, the bartender there, mixes drinks like a mechanic tuning a car. When she muddles the mint in sugar syrup, she puts her weight into it to squeeze every last bit of flavor from the leaves. Then she adds ice, splashes in vodka and strawberry pur\u00e9e, and stirs, steadily and rhythmically. She dips the rim of a chilled martini glass into a pool of sugar and finely ground oven-dried strawberries, pours in the drink and lets a shot of Champagne fill what space remains. The strawberry flavor is low and long, and before it weighs you down, it's nipped by the mint and bubbles. ''You know the new rave with the apple martinis and everything,'' Ms. Eng said. ''We wanted to do something for summer. It took four or five prototypes.''"]
["living", "Christine Chang, the pastry chef, got involved. She made a fresh strawberry pur\u00e9e, which enlivened the drink. And she made a strawberry powder for the rim of the glass by baking thin slices of the berries in a 200-degree oven until they were like potato chips and pulverizing them in a spice grinder. Mixed with sugar, the strawberry powder gives you a burst of the fruit on your tongue just before the drink hits and washes it away. The blackberry Champagne spritzer at Five Points also begins in the kitchen. Beau Houck, the chef de cuisine, takes care of all the infusions for the bar. For the spritzer, he first cooks blackberries with sugar, bay leaves and rosemary. Once the mixture is blended, he strains out the fruits and herbs and reduces it again, this time with just bay leaves, until it's quite concentrated. Mr. Houck also makes the base for the herb lemonade, coarsely pur\u00e9eing lemon zest and juice with basil, mint, cilantro, tarragon, oregano and sugar syrup, and then straining it. Out at the bar, the viscous extract is melded with ice and club soda. Though Five Points doesn't, you could add a little vodka for zip. The herb lemonade spritzer is more refreshing than water, and should count as a form of aromatherapy. The basil booms in your mouth, with the other herbs tinkling like chimes. Only after a minute do you recall the lemon, and then it somehow seems exceptionally fragrant, like a Meyer lemon. Only it isn't. This drink contains very ordinary ingredients, things you might normally use to season a chicken, turned into a cocktail."]
["living", "Successful summer drinks rely on flavors from herbs, spices and fruits for structure, rather than alcohol and sugar, which can be heavy and flabby. ''I've learned a lot from the chef here,'' said Julie Reiner, the bartender at C3 Restaurant. ''And I get to use ingredients most restaurants don't have.'' Passion fruit pur\u00e9e lends fragrance to a martinilike drink; the heat of ginger juice flavors a cranberry cocktail. Ms. Reiner constructs drinks much as a chef creates a sauce, tightly layering flavors. In one summer drink, she infused Liliuokalani tea leaves in orange vodka, then used it as the foundation for a spiked iced tea. The vodka is poured over ice with fresh lemon juice, a simple syrup infused with mint tea leaves, and water. It has all the clean notes you get in an iced tea, only amplified. Eben Klemm, the bar manager at Pico, also uses tea to good effect in a julep. Lightly sweetened apricot-passion fruit tea is swirled in a glass of ice with Maker's Mark bourbon and a splash of club soda. A mint sprig is poked in between ice cubes. The fruity tea is tamed by the bourbon, and you get touches of sweetness and bitterness. Mr. Klemm took a classic drink, and rather than load it up with lots of extra flavors, added the tea, subtracted some mint and gave it a little sparkle with club soda. Splashes and garnishes can also do a lot to alter the mood of a drink."]
["living", "Mr. Klemm took white port, which is typically sipped like a dry sherry, put it over ice and added a splash of club soda and tonic water. It turned into a white wine spritzer that actually tastes good. You get wood and fruit and a little hint of citrus. At Ouest, a standard bloody mary is paired with a stalk of spicy pickled asparagus and iced with a layer of Junipero gin, which floats on top and slowly seeps into the thick red mixture. As you drink it, you find yourself going back and forth between the drink and the asparagus, taking a bite, using it to stir the drink, cooling the heat of the pickle with the drink and hoping the pickle will do the same with the drink. Sipping on something that's bright pink and crunching down on a pickled bean or mint leaf is one of summer's most pleasurable and least celebrated activities. I plan to enjoy it while I can. A few months from now, I'll be happy to be back in the grip of a Sazerac.

["nyregion", "Close Council Races Show Effects of Mayoral Coattails - The New York Times While the vast majority of the City Council ran unopposed or coasted to easy victories on Tuesday, several candidates faced hard-fought challenges. The results could shape the internecine contest to be the next speaker of that body, arguably the city\u2019s second most powerful position and one for which the only voters are the 51 members. The outcomes, based on early returns, also indicated that in some of the closest races, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s successful campaign provided enough coattails to propel fellow Democrats to wins around the city. Incumbents in nearly every instance kept their seats; new Democratic candidates prevailed. Perhaps the biggest tossup race occurred in the southwestern corner of Brooklyn, in Bay Ridge and surrounding neighborhoods, where Mr. de Blasio\u2019s Republican challenger in the general election, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, and his rival for the Democratic nomination, the former city councilman Sal F. Albanese, had previously won elections. The council district there, the 43rd, saw a close contest between Justin Brannan, a former Democratic political aide to the outgoing councilman and a punk rock guitarist, and John F. Quaglione, a Republican who has spent most of his career working for the local state senator, Martin J. Golden, the only State Senate Republican from Brooklyn. The race, fought on doorstep issues like school crowding and transit service, was also a kind of proxy battle over Mr. de Blasio. Discontent with the mayor was such that Mr. Quaglione made it a key part of his message, and Mr. Brannan declined an invitation from Mr. de Blasio to campaign with him."]
["nyregion", "In the end, Mr. Brannan appeared headed for victory, with roughly 51 percent of the vote to 47 percent. Nearby in Brooklyn, an ugly battle erupted in the 44th between two candidates to succeed Councilman David G. Greenfield, who decided to step down over the summer at a time when it was too late for other Democrats to enter the primary. Mr. Greenfield tapped an ally, Kalman Yeger, to take his spot on the Democratic line for the area, which covers Borough Park, Bensonhurst and Midwood. But the move angered another powerful player in the city\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community, Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who then backed his son, Yoni, to run in the general election on an independent line. The two sides clashed bitterly, trading insinuations of dirty tricks; ultimately, Mr. Yeger won by a wide margin. Several incumbents, including one of the Council\u2019s three Republican members, faced serious threats. The Republican, Eric Ulrich, who represents areas of southern Queens, had toyed with running for mayor, and then had to fend off a Democratic challenger, Michael G. Scala, who had the support of the leader of the Queens County Democratic Party. The contest had a direct effect on the race for Council speaker: Mr. Ulrich, who won handily on Tuesday, has said that given the county leaders\u2019 backing of his challenger, Mr. Ulrich would not remain with them on their choice of speaker."]
["nyregion", "As the results were still coming in, the makings of a potential upset were unfolding in a Queens district that includes neighborhoods like Maspeth, Ridgewood and Glendale. Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley struggled to hold off Robert F. Holden, whose campaign was energized by opposition to a proposed homeless shelter and to the city\u2019s practice of housing homeless people in hotels. Ms. Crowley bested Mr. Holden in the Democratic primary, but he ran in the general election as a Republican after party officials granted him their line. The two candidates appeared not only as the major party candidates, but also on five other party lines. As of late Tuesday, the race remained too close to call, with Mr. Holden leading by roughly 100 votes. By contrast, in another centrist Queens district, Councilman Paul Vallone appeared to have little trouble holding onto his seat. In Lower Manhattan, Councilwoman Margaret Chin survived a challenge from Christopher Marte, a first-time candidate whom she had defeated in the Democratic primary by a 222-vote margin and who ran against her again in the general election, drawing on anger over development. So, too, did Mathieu Eugene, a councilman in central Brooklyn who barely made it out of a multicandidate primary. He had the backing of Mr. de Blasio in that race and in the general election. Both times he contended with a challenge from Brian Cunningham, a former chief of staff to a council member. Both times, Mr. Eugene emerged victorious."]
["science", "Lab Chimps Are Moving to Sanctuaries \u2014 Slowly - The New York Times BLUE RIDGE, Ga. \u2014 On the 16-hour ride from Louisiana, Bo looked out the window, took in the scenery, dozed and relaxed. He was traveling with five other male chimps from the New Iberia Research Center in Lafayette, La., where they had been members of a colony of nearly 200 animals kept for biomedical and other research. During the ride, some of the other chimps hooted, restless and unsettled. Not Bo. \u201cHe\u2019s the best,\u201d said the driver of the truck. The animals arrived at Project Chimps, a sanctuary at the southern end of the Blue Ridge Mountains about 100 miles north of Atlanta, at 6:30 a.m. one day last spring. As the sanctuary staff began to open the truck and move the chimps\u2019 cages inside the facility, the occupants hooted and screamed, anxious and uncertain about what was going on. The first cage was opened into a sort of antechamber, and a chimp named Jason was first to explore his new home, rushing with what seemed like nervous energy through a small door into the large habitat. Called a villa, the enclosed space is built like an extremely large metal cage, about 1,500 square feet and two stories high with metal platforms at different levels. Jabari, the second arrival, slowly joined Jason to explore the new enclosure, but they kept their distance from each other. Lance was third in line, hesitant to leave the small antechamber. The staff waited about a half-hour for him to build up his nerve."]
["science", "Then, hoping to encourage Lance, they decided to let in Bo, the group\u2019s dominant chimp. Bo knuckle-walked, casually and confidently \u2014 knuckle-swaggered, you might say \u2014 into the large enclosure. Lance followed immediately. And then the group hugs began. Eddie and Stirlene, the last two chimps, came through the entrance to more hugs. The group\u2019s relief and happiness was so infectious that all the humans smiled. The chimps lip-smacked and held one another\u2019s genitals. \u201cThat\u2019s normal reassuring behavior,\u201d Jen Feuerstein, the top administrator at the sanctuary, told me. Bo was in the house, and all was well. It probably will stay that way in the long run: The era of biomedical research on chimpanzees in the United States is effectively over. Given the nearly 100-year history of experimenting on chimps, the changes seemed to come fairly quickly once they began. In 2011, the director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, declared that the N.I.H. would fund no new biomedical research using chimps, which he described as \u201cour closest relatives in the animal kingdom\u201d deserving of \u201cspecial consideration and respect.\u201d His comments were both stunning and obvious. Jane Goodall, the famed primatologist, and others already had shown the world the richness of chimp intelligence and social life; molecular biology had revealed that humans and chimps share 98 percent of their DNA. But the biomedical scientific establishment has long emphasized the importance of animal research."]
["science", "Dr. Collins\u2019s decision reflected widespread ethical concerns among scientists about the treatment of such social, intelligent animals. But on a practical level, the care of chimps is costly, and they aren\u2019t always a good model in which to study human diseases. They\u2019re also a magnet for public concern. By 2015, the N.I.H. had gone through several stages of decision-making and concluded that it would retire all chimps it owned, retaining none for potential emergency use \u2014 in case of a human epidemic, for instance. The agency owns about 220 chimps outside of those now in sanctuaries and supports another 80, which will also be retired. That year the Fish and Wildlife Service classified all chimpanzees as endangered, removing a longstanding exemption for captive chimps that had allowed biomedical experiments. The decision made such research illegal without a permit requiring that any such experiments benefit chimpanzees. Privately funded medical research on privately owned chimps also was effectively banned. Currently, about 547 chimps are still held at research institutions, according to ChimpCARE, a site that tracks all chimps in the United States. Some of them are owned or supported by the N.I.H., and some are owned by research institutes like New Iberia, which is part of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. All the government chimps are headed to Chimp Haven, a sanctuary in Keithville, La., where they will have a full social life and room to roam outdoors."]
["science", "Some critics say the process has been unnecessarily slow, but both Chimp Haven and the N.I.H. say transfers are moving more quickly now. The sanctuary has accepted 14 chimps in the past two months and is expecting more before the end of the year. Chimp Haven, with a staff of 50, more than 200 chimps and a 30-year history, has had a lot of experience caring for retired chimps. They are kept in mixed groups of various sizes and their social interactions monitored. To prevent breeding new chimps that would have to spend their lives in captivity, Chimp Haven gives all the males vasectomies. But \u201cvasectomies do fail,\u201d said Raven Jackson-Jewett, the attending veterinarian at the sanctuary. \u201cConan was the one that taught us that.\u201d Conan had the procedure but somehow fathered three youngsters anyway, including Tracy, now 10 and a favorite of visitors. Dr. Jackson-Jewett said that because of Conan, Chimp Haven had learned that chimp vasectomies fail more often than those in humans. The staff changed its technique, re-vasectomized about 75 chimps with the new method, and hasn\u2019t had a pregnancy since. The sanctuary also has learned to care for frail chimps. Many animals from labs have been infected with H.I.V. and hepatitis for vaccine experiments, and some have diabetes (not related to experiments). They are often old: Some arrive near 50 years of age, and the lifespan of chimps in captivity runs from 50 to 60 years. Occasionally chimps are deemed too old even to handle the stress of being sent to the sanctuary."]
["science", "The sanctuaries hope eventually to put themselves out of business. If all goes as planned, in another 50 years or so, there will be no more lab retirees. Chimps will still be in zoos and, as the laws now stand, private owners could still breed them. But since the demand for their use in research is now zero, that is unlikely to happen on a large scale. Most privately owned laboratory chimpanzees are also headed for retirement centers. New Iberia has shipped 22 animals to Project Chimps, where Bo and his cohort now live, but still has nearly 200. The Project Chimps facility, which formerly housed gorillas, is still being renovated for chimps. They will get to play in eight acres of walled-in open space, with trees, a stream and an open meadow \u2014 once the walls are fixed. (Unlike gorillas, chimps are agile climbers.) Those left at New Iberia aren\u2019t isolated. They live in groups in large, dome-shaped outdoor cages. The domes have a bit less than a 1,000 square feet of floor space. Although chimps in research were once housed in smaller cages, and in isolation for experiments, practices have changed; labs and sanctuaries have recognized that it is cruel to house chimps alone. The only other private chimps still at research institutions include 46 owned by the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, and one at Georgia State University. Yerkes is looking for retirement facilities for its chimps and has sent seven to the Chattanooga Zoo."]
["science", "Yerkes also sent eight chimpanzees  to an unaccredited zoo in England, prompting an outcry from animal welfare advocates in this country and in Europe. The move prompted a lawsuit, because the Fish and Wildlife Service approved it even though advocates insisted there were better options in the United States. Yerkes said that the English zoo was well equipped and enlisted comment from Dr. Goodall, who said she had visited the facility and supported the move. The lawsuit was the first test of the protections offered to chimps by the endangered species classification. Exportation requires a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service, which can only be granted if the action benefits the species. The agency accepted Yerkes\u2019s argument that a donation by the English zoo to a group that had never before worked with chimps fulfilled that requirement. The decision outraged many primatologists and chimp advocates, but in the end the courts allowed the move. Within the animal welfare community, some of the elation about the government decisions of a few years ago has now, inevitably, been replaced by a recognition of the difficult logistics, the need for continued fund-raising and the occasional roadblocks. \u201cPatience has been a huge lesson for me,\u201d Laura Bonar, chief program and policy officer at Animal Protection of New Mexico, said in an interview. Ms. Bonar was one of the activists who had worked to bring about the decisions to end experimentation."]
["science", "Patience is useful even in the case of chimps like Bo, who have already been transferred to sanctuaries. Soon, perhaps by the end of this year, Bo and the other chimps at the sanctuary are expected to step outside of steel bars for the first time in their lives. They have been doing well. Janie Gibbons, one of the staff members who takes care of the chimps, said Bo continues to lead by example \u2014 as he did recently when the group encountered something they never seen before. The first time they were given tomatoes, they were flummoxed. \u201cBo is very brave and tries things first,\u201d said Ms. Gibbons. \u201cHe took one and very meticulously ate the peel first, then the fruit.\u201d Satisfied that tomatoes were safe, the others followed. But not all in a rush: Jabari threw his first tomato against the wall, even though he and the other chimps had gathered around Bo and peered as closely as they could as he ate the alien fruit. Now the chimps all eat tomatoes as if they were apples. And that\u2019s what the future may hold for all chimps: open space and tomatoes. But it\u2019s just going to take a while."]

Striker Te\u00f3filo Guti\u00e9rrez poked in Colombia\u2019s second goal, off a deflected corner kick, in the 58th minute, and James Rodr\u00edguez capped the scoring with a low shot in stoppage time off a slick backheel flick from Juan Guillermo Cuadrado. \u201cIt was a good debut with players who had never played a World Cup,\u201d Colombia Coach Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman said, adding: \u201cThis is how we planned this match.

["opinion", "Women Lose in New York State - The New York Times With too many misguided governors and legislators around the country trying to deny women the freedom to have an abortion, New York State was supposed to be a shining example of a government that cares about a woman\u2019s right to choose. That did not happen. Late last week, the State Legislature ended its 2013 session by failing to pass Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s 10-point Women\u2019s Equality Act. The bill would have assured women of the protections now available under Roe v. Wade even if the Supreme Court chooses to undermine or narrow that decision. If Mr. Cuomo still wants to make this an achievement of his first term, which ends next year, he will have to convince a few so-called moderate Republicans to come aboard. Senate Republicans, including those who claim to support abortion rights, allowed floor votes on nine points of the bill but refused to allow a vote on abortion rights. That effectively killed the entire package, even though the Assembly had approved it. It also served as a reminder of how the Republicans will really vote on the matter. Voters should keep this in mind when next year\u2019s elections roll around, especially those of Dean Skelos, the State Senate leader; his Republican allies; and two Democrats who are hostile to women\u2019s issues: Senators Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr. of the Bronx and Simcha Felder of Brooklyn.

["world/africa", "Shabab Attack in Somalia Sets Off Predawn Gun Battle - The New York Times NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into the gates of an African Union base in central Somalia on Thursday, setting off a predawn gun battle between militants and African Union soldiers. The Shabab militant group, which has been terrorizing Somalia for years, claimed responsibility for the attack in the Hiran region, saying on Somali news media that its fighters had stormed the base and killed dozens of soldiers. It is difficult to know what really happened in the attack. The Shabab often exaggerate their battlefield successes in their public claims. And the African Union rarely shares details about its confrontations with militants, and has tried in the past to minimize defeats. Lt. Col. Joe Kibet, an African Union spokesman, said he could not comment on the number of union soldiers who were killed Thursday, but he did say that at least 110 Shabab fighters had died in the attack. \u201cThe fighting was heavy,\u201d Colonel Kibet said. \u201cWe managed to repulse them with a lot of casualties, including many of them.\u201d Somali government officials said that 240 Shabab fighters had been killed and that dead bodies were scattered for miles.

He is 77 and proud of a life that is longer on memories than it is on bankroll. Sixty years ago, he was a Brooklyn kid in California learning about horses from a crew of cowboys. He survived them and became a jockey, mostly for broke horsemen on both coasts, before finding his true gift on backwater shed rows like this one, where he trains horses amid the sounds of rakes scraping gravel and noses thumping against feed tubs. He has known plenty of characters, but not many like the ones he is surrounded by now. There are Perry Martin and Steve Coburn, the breeders and owners of their famous colt. They both wear bushy mustaches and have found solace in horses, but they have little else in common. There is Victor Espinoza, the jock who rides him. Espinoza overcame a crippling fear of horses to become one of the best jockeys in the nation, until he got a little too comfortable there and found himself back among the ordinary rank of riders. He met a woman and then the right horse. Then there are the Delgado brothers, Willie and Alberto. Sherman changed both riders\u2019 lives, but now one of them is heartbroken about it."]
["sports", "Few of these characters know one another all that well. In some cases, they remain strangers. What they share, however, is a horse named California Chrome, and they all fell hard for him in their own way. The colt comes from common stock and grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in thoroughbred racing, but he is pinup pretty, with a lustrous chestnut coat pulled taut over a body that looks wrought by the hands of a sculptor. His name was pulled out of a cowboy hat \u2014 for real \u2014 and combines his birthplace with the term used by horse people for the flashes of white on a horse. California Chrome sports bobby socks on all four feet, and his face is creased by a white racing stripe. He is carrying the hopes of a battered sport on his back along with the curiosity of those who do not really care about horse racing but prefer their narratives dented and dusty and with a whiff of tall tale. California Chrome won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, and on Saturday, he will try to become the 12th horse to sweep the Triple Crown and the first since Affirmed in 1978. Sherman knows that is a long time for the sport to wait for a savior. \u201cMy horse is an extra special horse,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. \u201cIf it\u2019s meant to be, he\u2019ll win this race and he\u2019ll be immortal.\u201d The Odd Couple"]
["sports", "Is California Chrome extra special by design or destiny? Martin and Coburn, the owners, make a case for both. They are friendly but not overly familiar partners. Martin lives in Yuba City, Calif., and Coburn 166 miles to the east in Topaz Lake, Nev. Their world views are just as disparate. They met when they were part of Blinkers On Racing Stable, one of the syndicates that allow horse enthusiasts to own a small piece of a runner while learning the game. They got along in the way that opposites sometimes do. \u201cPerry was with me before Steve,\u201d said Scott Sherwood, the syndicate\u2019s founder and managing partner. \u201cHe definitely was the shy one of the two.\u201d They were among the partners in Love the Chase, a small filly who managed only a single victory in six races, all near the bottom level of claiming ranks at Golden Gate Fields. When it was time for Blinkers On to get rid of her, Martin and Coburn decided that they wanted to try their hand at the breeding game and that they might as well go into business together. At the time, a groom in the barn of Love the Chase proclaimed that someone would have to be a \u201cdumbass\u201d to pay anything at all for the filly. The men bought her anyway, for $8,000, and decided they not only had a name, DAP Racing, for their fledgling partnership, but also a good reason to feature a green donkey on their purple racing silks."]
["sports", "Martin, 58, has spent his career employing mind over matter. He owns Martin Testing Laboratories and a chemical company along with his wife, Denise. He earned a master\u2019s degree in solid state physics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. He spent more than a decade performing electronic failure analysis and environmental quality testing for the Air Force at McClellan Air Force Base. He knows avionics and weapons systems, and has briefed members of Congress and the Air Force chief of staff. \u201cElectronic Failure Analysis Handbook,\u201d a textbook he wrote, is more than 500 pages. \u201cHe thinks more than he talks,\u201d said John Harris, who owns Harris Farms in Coalinga, Calif., where Love the Chase resides and California Chrome was bred and raised. Martin immersed himself in the puzzle of pedigree and thought long and hard about how he was going to succeed in the breeding business. He bought into the theory that a good horse could come from anywhere. He chose the stallion Lucky Pulpit, who stood for a bargain basement $2,000, which seemed fair for a runner who had won only three of his 22 starts. Martin understood, however, that the female side of the family can be far more important to passing on the traits of a runner. In Love the Chase, he and Coburn had a bloodline rich in stamina and class. California Chrome descends from the mare Betty Derr, whose line includes another California-bred horse, Swaps, the 1955 Derby winner, as well as Iron Liege, the \u201957 Derby champ."]
["sports", "\u201cIt is a line also dotted with some of the most respected human names in the breeding business as well, such as Louis B. Mayer, Warner L. Jones, Will Farish and Raymond Guest,\u201d said Sid Fernando, a pedigree consultant. \u201cThese breeders utilized some of the greatest staying sires in this country to breed these mares.\u201d Martin was so convinced that he had built a classic horse that before California Chrome ever walked onto a racetrack, he sent an email to Sherman, the trainer, with the header \u201cThe Road to the Derby,\u201d laying out the races the colt would run to get there. Sherman thought his new clients were earnest but perhaps a little goofy. \u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream, but not every dream comes true,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must have got somebody up there looking out for them. Chrome has hit every one of those races in the plan.\u201d In fact, with each passing month, the value of California Chrome has increased. In January, after the colt won the California Cup Derby, Lucky Pulpit\u2019s stud fee was increased to $10,000 a coupling, and suddenly he had a full book of 124 mares awaiting him. Next year that price is likely to double. In March, after California Chrome ran away with the San Felipe Stakes, Martin and Coburn turned down $6 million for half of the colt. They have turned down another $1.5 million for Love the Chase as well as six-figure offers for California Chrome\u2019s full sisters, a foal and yearling still at Harris Farm."]
["sports", "Now, after six straight stakes victories and nearly $3.5 million in purse earnings, the breeding farms in central Kentucky have come calling with multimillion-dollar offers to syndicate California Chrome whether he wins the Triple Crown or not. \u201cThat $6 million that they refused earlier is chicken feed for whatever he\u2019s going to be worth now,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHe\u2019s already worth $20 million.\u201d One reason they keep turning down the money is that the making of California Chrome has been more than just an intellectual pursuit for Martin. He and his wife have been driving the 270 miles from their home to the San Joaquin Valley and Harris Farms. It is a working ranch scented by California\u2019s largest feedlot, and it has been drained of all color by a relentless drought. It is the farthest thing from a postcard of horse country, but the Martins have traveled there for years to visit Love the Chase, California Chrome and now his two sisters. \u201cThey are here a lot, and it\u2019s not for a quick visit,\u201d said Dave McGlothlin, who runs the horse division of Harris Farms. \u201cThey bring carrots and spend the afternoon.\u201d But the more California Chrome has won, the less Martin has wanted to talk about his horse.

Three weeks before Chrome was born, he said, he had a dream that sent him tugging his wife awake so he could deliver a prophecy. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to be a big chestnut colt with a white blaze,\u201d Coburn told her. When Carolyn Coburn first laid eyes on the foal in his stall, she called to her husband. \u201cCome here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is your dream.\u201d When he looked inside, he was inspired. \u201cThis horse is going to do something big,\u201d he told his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but we\u2019re going to stay in the game to make sure this colt gets to be the best that he can be.\u201d Coburn has been talking about his gift from heaven ever since. In January, when California Chrome was merely a promising colt, with three wins in seven starts, Coburn walked into Sharkey\u2019s Casino in Gardnerville, Nev., and bet $1,000 at odds of 200-1 that he would win the Kentucky Derby. In the weeks before the Derby, he proclaimed Chrome\u2019s victory on the first Saturday of May \u201ca done deal.\u201d"]
["sports", "\u201cIt will be 36 years this year since there\u2019s been a Triple Crown winner,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cHe will be the first California-bred to ever win a Triple Crown.\u201d The Jockey There was a birthday cake waiting for him in the winners\u2019 circle on May 23, along with a dozen of his colleagues \u2014 all of them race riders, many of them half his age. Victor Espinoza was spending his 42nd birthday at Santa Anita Park, riding a few races atop a couple of decent horses. He was having quite a month. Victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness were behind him, and another crack at a Triple Crown awaited him in 15 days at the Belmont Stakes. He was not yet ready to talk about the mile-and-a-half Test of the Champion, as the Belmont is known. \u201cI\u2019m still having fun from the last two wins \u2014 I\u2019m not thinking about the next race,\u201d Espinoza said then, a lighthouse smile creasing a face as cracked and worn as an old saddle. Espinoza had been in this position before, in 2002 when War Emblem went to New York with a chance to sweep the series. He does not remember what he did then to celebrate his 30th birthday. He does remember not having terribly much fun. He was in his prime and on top of the sport, but it had not been easy for him to get there."]
["sports", "He had grown up afraid of horses and had to work at making them comfortable with him. He struggled with his English. Espinoza was being pushed and pulled by the pressure of the Triple Crown attempt and the demands of a tough boss, the trainer Bob Baffert, who had come close to winning a Triple Crown with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998. Espinoza\u2019s previous bid for history ended before it started: War Emblem scraped his knees after stumbling at the start, and from there the Belmont got worse: He finished 19 lengths behind a 70-1 shot named Sarava. \u201cI thought that was my shot,\u201d he said, \u201cand that was it.\u201d Espinoza kept his head down and continued to grind out a living at the top of the national jockey standings. Over the next five years he averaged more than 200 victories and more than $12 million in purses by being what his agent, Brian Beach, called a steady Eddy. Espinoza is a natural lightweight (112 pounds), runs five miles a day and is a regular in the weight room. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t drink, and he\u2019s not a partyer,\u201d Beach said. \u201cHe\u2019s light and a good finisher. He gives an honest appraisal of the horse after he gets off. No sugarcoating it \u2014 you know where you stand with Victor.\u201d Four years ago, as his 38th birthday approached, Espinoza took an honest appraisal of himself. He was receiving fewer mounts and winning less often. His annual earnings were half of what they had been. He decided it was his own fault. He was tired and bored."]
["sports", "\u201cI wasn\u2019t hungry and I wasn\u2019t having any fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking of retiring.\u201d He was beginning a personal relationship, one that made him consider abandoning his bachelor ways. She was younger than he was and did not know much about horse racing or his career. Espinoza liked it that way. They were nearly a year into the relationship when she found out he had won a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was aboard one of those horses who had gone to the Belmont Stakes with a shot at sweeping the series. \u201cHave you ever thought about doing it again?\u201d she asked him. Espinoza explained to her that winning a single Derby was hard enough and that the odds were long that he would find a horse with the ability to win another one, let alone capture the Preakness and return to New York with a Triple Crown hanging in the balance. But the conversation haunted him. \u201cNow that I\u2019m happy away from the track,\u201d he told himself, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I be happier on it?\u201d There was no reason. Espinoza decided to look forward to the mornings when he would get on horses and try to drum up new business instead of dreading them. He chose to enjoy his time aboard the creatures who had taken him from a farm in Mexico to a big house at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains and another on the beach near Del Mar."]
["sports", "Espinoza decided to win another Derby for his girlfriend, to win another one for himself. Now, all he needed was the right horse. One year passed, then another, and another, and America\u2019s most famous race went off without him. But one morning last August at Del Mar, Espinoza was working a horse on the racetrack when he saw a flash of white blow by him. He saw the ivory face and the matching socks. The colt\u2019s narrow frame and playfulness left little doubt he was a 2-year-old. When the colt got to running, however, Espinoza was transfixed. He hit the ground as if he were walking on clouds. He stretched out as supplely as a yogi. Espinoza asked around and found that the horse\u2019s name was California Chrome. He is not one to study The Daily Racing Form or pore over video, but he did watch replays of California Chrome\u2019s previous races. \u201cI fell crazy for that horse,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Brian about him and that someday I\u2019d like to ride him.\u201d The Delgado Brothers These days, Willie Delgado is the most celebrated exercise rider in horse racing. Each morning at Belmont Park, he is surrounded by cameras and asked to tell the world how California Chrome is feeling. He is good at it, too \u2014 smiling, exuberant and poetic. \u201cHe trains himself,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s half-human \u2014 best ever.\u201d He knows the colt\u2019s quirks: how he likes to drop his shoulder and spin when agitated, how he nibbles and bites at his groom or passing horses."]
["sports", "Delgado, 46, is a race tracker. He ate himself out of a career as a jockey \u2014 zero victories in 45 starts. He never got any traction as a trainer, either, managing six victories in 116 starts, but not one of them for his most loyal owner: himself. But he does know how to communicate with a horse in the morning and pass on what he has learned to his trainer. It\u2019s a skill set that can be worth $700 or so a week, and some ample bonus money with the right horse. In California Chrome, Delgado knows he has hit the jackpot, but not without a high cost. This was supposed to be his brother\u2019s ticket to the big time. Alberto Delgado, 49, is a race rider who was good enough to win a 1982 Eclipse Award as outstanding apprentice jockey and almost 3,000 races, mostly in Maryland. In November 2012, however, he left the mid-Atlantic circuit for California after being suspended for 30 days for \u201cfailure to put forth his best effort\u201d on a 1-2 favorite. He knew that he was heading into one of the toughest circuits in horse racing without knowing a single trainer or owner. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to follow my heart,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. When Alberto Delgado arrived, he did what new faces do. He haunted the backside in the mornings, meeting trainers and offering to get on any horse they had. Weeks went by before anyone took him up on it, and then it was only 50-1 shots in cheap races."]
["sports", "He caught a break when an exercise rider scheduled to work horses for Sherman failed to show up and Delgado filled in. One of the horses he was atop that morning was California Chrome. Delgado liked the feel of him. \u201cHow many races has this horse won?\u2019 he asked Sherman. \u201cNone, he\u2019s a baby,\u201d the trainer replied. Sherman had a soft spot for scuffling jocks \u2014 he was one himself. He asked Alberto Delgado back to work horses in the mornings. He put him on a couple of live ones in the afternoon. \u201cI was known as a poor man\u2019s jock,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI rode for guys who had one- or two-horse stables, and more often than I like to admit I\u2019d put the $25 for jock fees up myself. These guys didn\u2019t have it, and if I didn\u2019t put it up, the horse would be scratched.\u201d When California Chrome made his debut on April 26, 2013, at Hollywood Park, Alberto Delgado had the mount and finished second at odds of 6-1. The trainer\u2019s son and assistant, Alan Sherman, was disappointed: He had put $500 on the colt to win. But Delgado rode California Chrome well enough to earn a return engagement the next month and guided the colt to a two-and-three-quarter-length victory. As soon as Delgado got off him, he told Steve Coburn what Coburn and his co-owner already knew. \u201cThis horse will win the Derby,\u201d Alberto Delgado told him. \u201cI\u2019ve been riding for 31 years, and I never felt that before. It was weird.\u201d"]
["sports", "In the meantime, Alberto Delgado had called his little brother, Willie, and invited him to Del Mar, the beach town racetrack built by Bing Crosby that is a summer playground for the surf-meets-the-turf set. He watched Alberto and California Chrome win again, this time in a stakes race. It took Willie 24 hours before he decided to go west, too. \u201cI went back to Maryland and got rid of the horses I was training,\u201d Willie Delgado said. He, too, landed in Sherman\u2019s barn when California Chrome\u2019s regular exercise rider was on vacation. Alberto recommended his brother. Willie and Alberto were together Sept. 4 when California Chrome was made one of the favorites for the $300,000 Del Mar Futurity. Nearing the far turn of the seven-furlong race, California Chrome hurtled forward as if sprung from a slingshot. Alberto Delgado decided to split horses in the stretch, but the colt took an accidental whip to his face from the jockey of a rival, stopping his momentum. They finished two lengths behind the winner, in sixth place. \u201cIf I had gotten outside, I would have won,\u201d Alberto Delgado said. Still, he retained the mount, but his next start on California Chrome was his last. In the $200,000 Golden State Juvenile, he planned to go straight for the lead from his inside post position. Instead, the horse reared up when the gate opened and came out running in last place. He finished sixth again. Alberto Delgado chalked it up to bad luck. Sherman knew it was more than that."]
["sports", "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t ride enough, situations come up and you don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cYou got to ride every day, and get with it, and get your timing, a natural thing. You can\u2019t worry, \u2018Is he going to take me off this horse?\u2019 Bad things happen then, and they did.\u201d Willie Delgado stayed with the horse. Alberto Delgado was out. Two months later, Sherman called Beach and asked him if Espinoza was available to ride in the King Glorious Stakes. Sherman had used Espinoza at Golden Gate Fields in Northern California when the jockey was first starting out. He was looking for a \u201csteady rider\u201d for California Chrome, one who would get out of the way of the best horse Sherman ever had in his barn. Beach remembered his conversation with Espinoza about the fast colt with \u201call that white.\u201d He said absolutely. California Chrome has won six straight since Espinoza has climbed on. Not long ago, Alberto Delgado returned home to Maryland to put back together what has been a solid, if not spectacular, career. He watched the Kentucky Derby at a friend\u2019s party. He knew California Chrome would run well. \u201cWhen he won, I was heartbroken,\u201d he said. Alberto and Willie do not talk about California Chrome. After the colt won the Preakness, Alberto showed up at a party at Chrome\u2019s barn. He hugged his brother and shook the hand of Sherman and Espinoza."]
["sports", "\u201cMaybe it just wasn\u2019t meant to be, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to go with,\u201d Alberto Delgado said. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for the horse.\u201d The Trainer There is the crow of a rooster and Art Sherman is walking his shed row, running his hands over the flank of a horse, gripping the ankle of another. He smiles as he passes the empty stall, the one that belongs to California Chrome, the colt who has taken him further than he ever thought possible. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in this position,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a good one came along, I had owners that would sell them before I could develop them.\u201d Sherman is beyond the twilight of his career. He cherishes his nap time and confesses to spending too much time with morning television. Sherman also does not quite know what to make of the good fortune that landed in his barn and has upended a half-dozen or so lives. Much has been made of his association with Swaps, the California-bred who won the Derby in 1955. Sherman was a teenage exercise rider who shared a boxcar with the colt for four days on their way to Churchill Downs. It was what happened in the years before and after that, on Rex Ellsworth\u2019s ranch in Chino, Calif., that Sherman cherishes most."]
["sports", "His father was a barber, and his clientele included horseplayers who took a look at tiny Art and decided that he had the perfect makeup for a jockey. Now, all he needed was to learn about horses. Ellsworth\u2019s ranch became his Cowboy College. The East Coast breeders were genteel and aristocratic and rich enough to stay that way. Ellsworth was about saving money. The young horses were kept in pens, and to break them Sherman and his confederates threw sacks over their heads and saddles on their backs. \u201cI got bucked off four or five times every morning,\u201d Sherman said. It was a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week job, much like the one he has now. Sherman pulled foals out of mares and rode the pastures alongside a stallion to determine what mares were in heat and ready for Khaled, Swaps\u2019s father and one of California\u2019s greatest sires. He made $75 a month in his first year, $150 his second and $250 his last. \u201cI learned the fundamentals,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI learned how committed you had to be to be in this business.\u201d During his riding days, he was more like Alberto Delgado than Victor Espinoza. Sherman is proudest of his career as a trainer. He was not a natural. His wife, Faye, helped keep the family afloat by working at Bay Meadows Racetrack for 30 years in the track gift shop and as a parimutuel clerk. Art Sherman had a part-time job taking bets, too. \u201cMaking a living was tough,\u201d he said."]
["sports", "But over 53 years of marriage, Art and Faye built a family around horses. Alan Sherman, 46, works alongside Art and has been California Chrome\u2019s primary caretaker in the Triple Crown run. Steve Sherman, 50, has a stable out of Golden Gate Fields in Berkeley, Calif. They will all be in New York for the Belmont, and that is what Art says he is going to appreciate most of all. As for California Chrome, Art Sherman is philosophical. Sixty years on the racetrack have taught him that all the great ones get beaten and that fairy tales seldom come true. \u201cHe\u2019s done everything I could ever want in the horse,\u201d Art Sherman said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to prove anything to me.\u201d"]

["travel", "On Maine's Wilder Shores - The New York Times MAINE prayed for tourism and so God created all those outlet malls in the southern part of the state, the campsites at Baxter State Park to the north, and in the east Bar Harbor with its fudge emporiums, T-shirt stores and the high-speed ferry to Canada. That is right and proper and just the way the world should be. Of course, some few do not take the ferry but make their way up U.S. 1 along the coast to Campobello International Park to see the Roosevelt summer home and then go on into Canada. Hardly anyone ever turns off U.S. 1 on that drive except, perhaps, for gas or a lobster roll. But that is just exactly what I do when I have company visit me at my home in Maine in the summer. About 50 miles east of Ellsworth where the Bar Harbor traffic clears out, there is a sign on the highway for State Route 187, which also leads to Jonesport. Great Wass Island Preserve is a 1,579-acre Nature Conservancy jewel, a place of spectacular botanical interest, and Jonesport is situated on a postcard-pretty harbor. Tourism is not serious business in those parts \u2014 boat building and fishing are \u2014 and there are no signs telling how to get to Great Wass. But I know. Visiting there on a bright sunny summer day, you'll need sturdy walking shoes, water and a brown bag lunch. Binoculars and a field guide or two will make the day more of a pleasure."]
["travel", "Once in Jonesport, turn right and cross the harbor on the causeway and immediately take the road to the left. You'll find yourself on Beals Island in the midst of a cluster of small well-kept houses with pretty gardens. Watch the utility poles on your right, and very soon you'll see a little one that advises a left-hand turn to the hatchery. The advice is good. A few yards down a bumpy road is the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery (known around my household as the Clammery). Clams are dug by hand in tidal flats along the coast of Maine and provide a substantial income for some families. But too many have been taken, and some tidal flats have become degraded, so this hatchery raises clams to restock the flats for surrounding communities. The place is managed cooperatively with the University of Maine and staffed by marine science students who do their work in bright yellow or orange waterproof coveralls. They obviously enjoy showing visitors what they do (the place is run on a shoestring, so a couple of dollars slipped into the donation box at the education center is welcome)."]
["travel", "The inside of the building has all the warmth and fecundity of a greenhouse. To one side are cylinders of algae \u2014 chartreuse, tan, moss-green and orange \u2014 burbling away in sea water, the feed a clam requires. Flat, open 700-gallon sea water tanks are on the other side, the progressive nurseries of infant clams, products in induced spawn. It is a cheering sight to see zillions of specks growing into tiny recognizable clams as you walk along the tanks. In an adjacent building there are tanks of adult scallops, which the hatchery is working with to develop a similar nursery. Twice, recently, I have taken visitors there who were so obviously engaged with the entire setup that our student guide showed them how to determine the sex of a scallop, something my visitors have dined out on for months. After leaving the hatchery, drive back to the blacktop road, turn left and continue following it to a T-intersection. There, high on a utility pole, easy to miss, is a tiny sign for the Nature Conservancy with an arrow to the right. The blacktop gives way to gravel before too long and then, on the left, is the Nature Conservancy parking lot. It is about three miles from the causeway."]
["travel", "I know a number of coastal trails in downeast Maine, all of them interesting. But the ones here at Great Wass are special in their own way because the island projects farther out to sea than any other land mass in eastern Maine and therefore is buffeted by all that the sea and weather has to offer. Growing there are plants and trees normally found far to the north, boreal rarities thriving in testing circumstances at the southern end of their range. The trails are rough and rocky but well marked; by skirting the shore they can be walked as a loop. I like to start along the left-hand branch, the one marked Mud Hole Trail. It runs through stands of ancient jack pine \u2014 short-needled, twisted, dwarfed and sculpted by wind and adversity into bonsai. There is Labrador tea, immediately recognizable from the velvety rust-colored undersides of its elliptical leaves. Revolutionary War patriots made a palatable tea from its leaves rather than drink British tea. In midsummer the sheep laurel blooms with such heavy clusters of deep pink blossoms they put garden azaleas to shame. But there are also some true rarities, such as the wonderfully named, tiny-flowered blinks. The Nature Conservancy helpfully lists them in its folder, which can be picked up at the registration box at the parking lot."]
["travel", "Another folder includes a checklist of birds. The Mud Hole Trail meanders out to sea beside a long cove seen through the spruce trees, fjord-beautiful with blue-green water. On the rocky shore I've seen seals playing and once a bald eagle frolicked (there is no other word for it) overhead. The Mud Hole Trail stops at the shore, but by walking along it, and climbing across the rocks, it does connect with the other trail, the one marked Cape Cove. And along that shore is as exhilarating a view as any I know along the Maine coast: the eastern islands and beyond them forever. The Cape Cove Trail crosses bogs on wooden walkways. The last time I was there thick stands of pitcher plants with lovely deep magenta flowers were in bloom. Pitcher plants are carnivorous and with scent and downward-curving spines entrap flies and other insects. The trail also leads back, again through jack pine, to the parking lot. Depending on how long you lunch and how much you stop and look (and there is a lot to look at) the entire circle route takes between four and six hours."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TAX CUT ISSUE; Bush Tax Cut Loses Appeal For Republicans in Congress - The New York Times Many Congressional Republicans have decided that the big across-the-board tax reduction advocated by their party's presidential nominee does not play well in their races for re-election and have instead adopted a strategy that emphasizes debt reduction and bite-size tax cuts. While many of them refuse to criticize the $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Republican candidates and incumbents on the campaign trail and in Congress have distanced themselves from his 10-year plan. Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is running for the House seat being vacated by Representative John R. Kasich, said voters were ''not especially'' intrigued by Mr. Bush's tax plan. ''What I am hearing more about this year are specific things, and the two specific things I'm hearing a lot about are the death tax and the marriage tax.'' Some Republican lawmakers say that Mr. Bush is repeating the mistake they made in 1999 when they pushed a tax-cut plan that totaled $800 billion over 10 years. After President Clinton refused to sign the bill, Republicans found so little public support for the proposal that they did not even try to override the veto. This year, Republicans broke their tax-cut proposals into smaller chunks, including one that would eliminate the so-called marriage penalty and another that would have abolished federal estate taxes. Though Mr. Clinton has also vetoed these proposals, Republicans say they are not shy about making them campaign issues in their attempt to hold on to their control of the House and the Senate."]
["us", "''I think it's just an individual emphasis,'' said Melissa Hart, a Pennsylvania Republican campaigning for the seat now held by Representative Ron Klink, a Democrat who is retiring. ''It's easier to get your arms around, especially the marriage penalty.'' Republican candidates for the House and Senate are running television advertisements that mostly focus on specific tax cuts, like ending the marriage penalty. Among those candidates who are taking a more cautious approach is Representative Rick A. Lazio, who is in a tight race with Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate seat from New York and who has proposed a more modest tax-reduction plan than Mr. Bush. In contrast, Mr. Bush has made his large tax cut the centerpiece of his campaign, a move that baffles some Congressional Republicans. ''Bush is trapped,'' said an aide to a Republican House leader who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He's where we were in 1999. He's talking about a big tax plan this year. Voters just want to know what's in the tax plan, the components, not a big number.'' Some Republican strategists say that talking about a huge lump-sum tax cut gives Democrats the opportunity to attack it as a sop to the wealthy. Indeed, the Bush campaign has in recent days tried to counter such attacks by showcasing families at campaign rallies and detailing how the tax-cut plan would aid them."]
["us", "''People are not aware of what the Bush package calls for,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. ''If they are just looking at the overall package and hear Gore talk about tax cuts for the wealthy, they tend to win. If we break down the tax package, we tend to win.'' To be sure, some Republicans embrace Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan. ''I think highly of his tax package,'' said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. ''We have to do a better job of selling the tax cut. They have to talk about the elements of it; if not, it never works. We learned that battle last year.'' And some Republicans say a major reason for any differences in emphasis is the differences in the offices that Mr. Bush and Congressional candidates are seeking. While presidential candidates tend to campaign on grand themes, those running for the House and Senate tend to push more measured proposals and more measured goals. ''The difference is running for the Senate, rather than running for president,'' said Stuart Roy, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''It's more salient for our candidates to talk about specific programs, and it's more believable. It's not believable that one single senator would be able to pass an expanded tax bill.'' Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, disputed the notion that there was any significant difference in emphasis between what the Republican presidential candidate is pushing on the stump and what Republican candidates for Congress are emphasizing."]
["us", "''All the smaller targeted tax cuts make up our tax cut -- marriage penalty relief, death tax repeal, abolition of the earnings limit,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''Those were all put forth in Congress this year and, of course, Congress has the burden of dealing with the president, who would rather spend more money than deliver tax relief.'' Choosing to push smaller tax cuts rather than rallying around Mr. Bush's tax-reduction plan has not necessarily made things easier for Republicans. Stymied by Mr. Clinton's vetoes of their estate-tax and marriage-penalty bills, Congressional Republicans on Tuesday introduced a proposal to apply what they said was 90 percent of next year's budget surplus to reduce the national debt. Though Republicans spoke of their proposal as committing 90 percent of next year's expected $268 billion surplus -- about $240 billion -- to paying down the national debt, a closer look at the plan reveals the new commitment to debt reduction is more modest. Since $198 billion of the expected surplus will be in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds -- two accounts that Congress has vowed not to use for spending programs or tax cuts -- that money would be applied to the national debt anyway. Thus the Republicans' plan only commits $42 billion in new funds -- or about 16 percent -- of the surplus for debt reduction. The idea is aimed at giving Republicans a politically palatable opening position in the budget negotiations with the White House, but the effect is to push them even farther away from Mr. Bush, who seldom mentions debt reduction."]
["us", "Democrats gleefully pointed out the differences between the Republicans' new stress on reducing the national debt and Mr. Bush's emphasis on slashing tax rates. ''Did he get the message that tax cuts are out?'' chortled Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ''They should make some ads and send a subliminal message to George Bush that tax cuts are not popular. Big time, as we say.'' Democratic leaders and administration officials today disparaged the Republicans' latest proposal to use some of the surplus to reduce the national debt. ''The American people aren't buying these huge tax cuts, and Republicans are scrambling to get away from them,'' said Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader."]

For most athletes, that would have been motivation enough. But these horses run for glory and carrots, not cash. They heed their jockeys, not sponsors. Visa had it all planned. Six times, company executives toted the oversize $5 million stunt check that would have been presented on television to the horses and their owners at Belmont Park. Such happy interludes would have reduced the time spent talking to New York\u2019s governor or any other designated public official and offered more time for the horse to kvell.

Visa ended its sponsorship in 2005, shifting to a global focus for its sports sponsorships, and no company has followed it to back a bonus. Visa was the title sponsor of the Triple Crown, a deal it made with Triple Crown Productions, the entity formed by the race\u2019s three tracks to negotiate marketing and television deals. \u201cIt was one of the single best marketing platforms we had as an organization,\u201d Lynch said. And it never needed to cram $5 million in small bills into saddlebags to pay a Triple Crown winner. That was covered by insurance premiums that would have paid the bonus. If not for Bob Lewis, the owner of Silver Charm, the first of six horses to keep Visa from making history with a Triple Crown winner, the payout would not have been $5 million. Initially, the bonus was to be the difference between the total winners\u2019 purses for the three races and $5 million. But Lewis was angry in 1997 when he learned it was not an extra $5 million. \u201cA bonus is a bonus,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 2003. \u201cIn my dictionary, bonus means \u2018payment over the usual required amount.\u2019\u00a0\u201d"]

Neither did Real Quiet, Charismatic, War Emblem, Funny Cide or Smarty Jones. Pascarella insisted he was not frustrated. He need not have been. Visa had six go-rounds where it could benefit from the attention paid to horses that had won the Derby and the Preakness. That there is no title sponsor guaranteeing a lucrative bonus is traceable largely to a deal made in 2004 by the New York Racing Association, which operates Belmont Park. At the time, NBC was in a five-year deal to carry all three races through 2005. But NYRA bolted, selling the rights to the Belmont Stakes from 2006 to 2010 to ESPN, which showed the race on ABC. NYRA was displeased that it was receiving only one-quarter of NBC\u2019s payments from Triple Crown Productions. Churchill Downs was getting 50 percent for the Kentucky Derby, and Pimlico Race Course was receiving 25 percent for the Preakness. \u201cThere had been an imperial relationship between Churchill Downs, then, and the Preakness and NYRA,\u201d said Len DeLuca, who was part of the ESPN negotiating team that acquired the Belmont for ABC. \u201cCandidly, we saw that. We talked actively with the people at the Preakness, but we were unsuccessful.\u201d Ed Seigenfeld, who was the executive vice president of Triple Crown Productions, recalled the effect of NYRA\u2019s move to ABC."]

Even since the Belmont returned to NBC in 2011, no company has replaced Visa. NBC is now looking to make a deal with all three tracks for the years after 2015, assuming it can renew its rights to carry the Preakness and the Belmont, as it already has for the Derby. \u201cThe scarcity of a winner for so many years and the ability to coordinate all the entities involved has probably caused the sponsorship community to wait to see us pull together a valuable package,\u201d said Seth Winter, the NBC Sports Group\u2019s executive vice president for sales and marketing. But no one, not a media giant like NBC Universal or its parent, Comcast, can guarantee a Triple Crown winner.

Let's go!'' commander Brian Duffy called out. Discovery rose from its seaside pad at 7:17 p.m., just after sunset, on NASA's fourth launch attempt. The shuttle had been grounded since last Thursday because of trouble with bolts, a valve, wind and a pin. The shuttle pierced thin, wispy clouds as it raced out over the Atlantic, its exhaust trail tinged peach, orange and red by the setting sun and surpassing the nearly full moon in brightness. Throughout Wednesday afternoon, the sky was overcast and a waterspout was spotted a few miles from the launch pad. But the weather improved dramatically by evening, and shuttle managers gave the nod. ``All good things are worth waiting for, and I think you and your crew have waited long enough for this one,'' launch director Mike Leinbach told the astronauts. ``Good luck on this extremely important mission to the international space station -- and have fun.'' Workers had to hustle to remove the small metal pin that was left on an oxygen line running between Discovery and its external fuel tank. The pin resulted in an embarrassing and costly delay for NASA on Tuesday."]

The space station was soaring 240 miles above the Bay of Bengal when Discovery finally soared. The chase will end with a docking on Friday. Discovery contains two new segments for the international space station. The crew's job is to attach the girderlike truss and docking port; four spacewalks will be needed to make all the connections, beginning Sunday. The 11-day mission has been on hold for two years, as have subsequent assembly flights, because of Russia's difficulties in launching the space station's crew quarters. The module was finally placed in orbit in July and was outfitted by a visiting space shuttle crew in September. The truss and docking port aboard Discovery must be installed on the space station before the first permanent crew can move in. NASA astronaut Bill Shepherd and his two-cosmonaut crew are scheduled to lift off from Kazakstan on Oct. 30. This will be NASA's fifth visit to the space station. But it's the first actual construction mission since the first pieces of the complex were launched in 1998. Six Americans and one Japanese make up the crew. Air Force Lt. Col. Pamela Melroy is making her first space flight; she is only the third woman to serve as a shuttle pilot. ``Pam, welcome to space and congratulations,'' Mission Control said 8 1/2 minutes into the flight."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR; Bush Says That the Bottom Line on Gore's Proposals Would Consume the Surplus - The New York Times Gov. George W. Bush opened a new line of attack against his Democratic rival today, accusing Vice President Al Gore of making so many promises in this campaign that he would devour the entire $4.6 trillion federal surplus projected for the next decade. Mr. Bush chose to fight on the economy and fiscal policy on a day when Mr. Gore unveiled an ambitious and detailed economic blueprint and called for the creation of a $300 billion rainy day fund to be set aside as an emergency source of money if the economy slows down. The Bush campaign took out a full page advertisement in some regional editions of USA Today quoting six Nobel laureates and nearly 300 other economists praising Mr. Bush's approach to fiscal policy. The Texas governor also seized on an analysis released by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, who said the cost of the vice president's programs could be as high as $906 billion more than he has estimated. ''I want America to add up all the promises my opponent has made,'' Mr. Bush told a crowd at an early morning airport rally in Scranton, Pa. ''All the promises over the course of this campaign. He has the easy style of campaigning. Go to one community and make a promise here, go to another community. When you add it all up, he's spent the entire surplus on bigger government. He won't admit it.''"]
["us", "Mr. Bush stood before a large blowup poster of the USA Today advertisement and used it to contrast his economic plan with Mr. Gore's. ''My plan has been endorsed by these Nobel prize winners and leading economists,'' Mr. Bush said. ''His plan has been endorsed by Bill Clinton.'' Mr. Bush's accusations were a mirror image of the Gore campaign's own assertions that it is the Republican candidate who is threatening the surplus because of his proposal to enact a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, and his spending programs. When Mr. Bush unveiled a $198 billion plan on Tuesday to change the Medicare system, Mr. Gore said, ''There is no money to pay for it if you give away all of the surplus in the form of a giant tax cut for the wealthy.'' At every campaign rally Mr. Bush is now featuring blue-collar families who he says would receive large reductions under his tax cut plan but would get little to nothing from Mr. Gore's proposals for smaller, more targeted tax cuts for such expenses as college education or home health care. ''We trust you with your money,'' Mr. Bush told crowds today as he promoted his tax cut in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Indiana. ''We trust you to make decisions with your lives. We don't trust bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. We don't believe in planners and deciders making decisions on behalf of America.''"]
["us", "At another airport rally here he appropriated Mr. Gore's theme of helping ''working families'' and  thundered, ''Guess which plan is on the side of the working people? It's our plan. It's our plan.'' Mr. Bush's turn to economic themes today was echoed by his running mate, Dick Cheney, who campaigned before a chamber of commerce in Wilmington, Del. Mr. Cheney said he believed that the economic policies of President Ronald Reagan should get a strong measure of credit for the booming economy of the last eight years. Answering a question from a member of the audience, Mr. Cheney compared Mr. Bush's tax cut proposal to Reagan's own income tax cuts of two decades ago, saying it was ''exactly what we did to get this prosperity begun in the first place, back in the early 80's under President Reagan.'' Later, speaking to reporters, Mr. Cheney said that the boom was created by 20 years of strong leadership of the Federal Reserve Board, reductions in military spending after the cold war and the tax policies of President Reagan and even those of President George Bush. ''My analysis would be a 20-year look at the economy and policy, not just the last eight years,'' he said. Still later in the day, an aide said Mr. Cheney wanted to clarify that he also gave a measure of credit to President Clinton for ''reluctantly signing'' fiscal measures approved by the Republican Congress, The argument over surpluses and deficits is a muddy one because accounts of how much each candidate will spend depends on estimates and projections."]
["us", "The Senate Republican analysis  found, for example, that Mr. Gore's proposals would overshoot the available surplus by as little as $27 billion over 10 years if the costs of Mr. Gore's spending plans are assumed to be at the low end of credible estimates. If the costs of the spending plans are assumed to be at the high end of estimates, Mr. Gore's budget would be in the red by as much as $906 billion over 10 years, the report said. For example, the report noted that Mr. Gore says his plan to increase retirement savings would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while other estimates put the cost at as much as $750 billion. The Gore campaign dismissed the report as partisan. The Bush campaign says that the governor's own plan leaves a $265 billion surplus. But John Cogan, an economics adviser to Mr. Bush, acknowledged today as he briefed reporters on Mr. Gore's spending, that the Bush figures do not account for the costs of deploying a missile defense system, but only for research and development. Mr. Bush has called for a far more robust system than the one that President Clinton had been contemplating at a cost of $60 billion. Mr. Cogan argued that Mr. Bush could offset the cost with other military spending savings. Mr. Bush also appeared today before the national convention of the American Legion, where he repeated calls for better military preparedness and better health care for veterans. Before he spoke, Alan Lance, the national commander, told the veterans' group that Mr. Gore had declined to appear before it because of a scheduling conflict."]

Now Mr. Klain, named on Friday by the president to be the administration\u2019s Ebola response coordinator, will have to put his knack for anticipating worst-case scenarios to work on what has rapidly become not just a public health mess for the White House, but a political one. A seasoned crisis-response operative and veteran of Democratic administrations and campaigns, Mr. Klain, 53, is charged with managing the federal efforts to monitor and contain the deadly virus that has touched off a wave of anxiety in the United States and raised questions about the competence of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. After Mr. Biden was elected vice president, Mr. Klain became his chief of staff, the same job he had served in under Al Gore. He is known for his ability to handle high-stakes and fast-moving political and policy challenges. Mr. Klain was the lead Democratic lawyer for Mr. Gore during the 2000 election recount, and was later played by Kevin Spacey in \u201cRecount,\u201d the HBO drama about the disputed contest."]
["us", "His appointment came as Mr. Obama and his team stepped up their efforts to monitor Ebola, which has sown mounting fear among the public despite having infected only three people in the United States. It has also intensified criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s management of a major national challenge, fueled in recent days by reports that two health care workers were infected while caring for an Ebola-afflicted patient at a Dallas hospital, and one worker who subsequently flew on an airplane with a fever. \u201cWhat we were looking for is not an Ebola expert but rather an implementation expert, and that\u2019s exactly what Ron Klain is,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cHe is somebody who has extensive experience in the federal government. He\u2019s somebody that has extensive management experience when it comes to the private sector.\u201d Mr. Klain, who left Mr. Biden\u2019s office in 2011, is currently the president of Case Holdings and the general counsel at Revolution L.L.C., companies that were founded by Steve Case, the former chief executive of AOL. Now, Mr. Earnest said, he will be focusing \u201c100 percent of his time on coordinating this whole-of-government response.\u201d The appointment drew criticism from congressional Republicans who said Mr. Klain \u2014 who has no record or expertise in Ebola specifically or public health in general \u2014 was the wrong person for the job."]

John Ullyot, a Republican strategist and communications consultant who worked with him in the private sector and on Capitol Hill, said it was Mr. Klain who met privately with Arlen Specter, the former Pennsylvania senator, to persuade him to switch his party affiliation in 2009 from Republican to Democrat. \u201cBringing him in is a clear signal to Washington that you have a real decision-maker with the ear of the president to be able to walk in and get a very quick decision on the thorniest issue,\u201d said Mr. Ullyot."]
["us", "Former colleagues say Mr. Klain has a track record of successfully dispatching with knotty problems, policy or political. They point to his work helping Mr. Biden oversee the $787 billion stimulus package, although the initiative has also earned him criticism, since it gave rise to a deal with the solar-panel company Solyndra, which went bankrupt after receiving $535 million in federal loan guarantees. \u201cRon will hit the ground running,\u201d Mr. Donilon said. \u201cHe has deep relationships, he can master huge amounts of information quickly, pull together a staff quite quickly and well, and he will be able to operate at the cabinet level.\u201d Mr. Klain, a graduate of Harvard Law School who was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Byron R.

["business/dealbook", "Samsung in Cross Hairs of American Hedge Fund - The New York Times Last year, a big American hedge fund took aim at plans to revamp a part of Samsung, the South Korean giant that dominates many of its home country\u2019s industries. Though it lost that battle, the hedge fund now has its sights on the crown jewel of the Samsung empire. Elliott Management proposed in a letter on Wednesday that Samsung essentially split its electronics business into two separate companies as part of a broader reshaping of the business. It is one of the most ambitious efforts yet by a foreign investor to inject American-style activist investing into the world of Asian business, where families often retain control of huge publicly traded companies. Among the most powerful of those dynasties is the Lee family of South Korea, whose Samsung conglomerate \u2014 known as a chaebol \u2014 oversees a daunting array of businesses like Galaxy smartphones, home appliances and shipbuilding. Some hedge funds have found success on a smaller scale. The investor Daniel S. Loeb succeeded in persuading Fanuc, a Japanese robot maker, to double its dividend \u2014 though his campaign there came after an unsuccessful run at Sony, an effort that included a partial listing of its entertainment arm. Elliott, which is run by the billionaire Paul E. Singer, tried last year to disrupt Samsung\u2019s efforts to merge two of the empire\u2019s affiliates, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. The move was meant to transfer more power to Jay Y. Lee, the son of the ailing chairman, Lee Kun-hee."]
["business/dealbook", "The activist hedge fund argued that the merger sharply undervalued Samsung C&T, and it won the backing of international investors. Still, the investment firm narrowly lost the vote. Now, Elliott is taking on Samsung Electronics, the most prominent part of the Korean conglomerate internationally. At the same time, the hedge fund \u2014 branded as a vulture capitalist during its last fight with the family \u2014 is trying to take a softer tone, arguing that the business\u2019s current setup has led to it being undervalued in the stock markets. It is unclear whether Elliott, which owns 0.62 percent of Samsung Electronics\u2019 shares, will fare better in this effort. Samsung is still reeling from the worldwide recall of its Note 7 smartphone over a problem with batteries igniting. But the hedge fund suggested in its letter on Wednesday that the roots of its campaign lay not in the recall but in the opaque, densely cross-linked holding structure of the Samsung kingdom. \u201cSimply put, the remarkable achievements of Samsung Electronics are not being properly reflected in the market\u2019s valuation of its shares,\u201d Elliott wrote in the letter. Meanwhile, Jay Y. Lee, who was nominated for a board seat at Samsung Electronics last month, is expected to lead a restructuring of his family\u2019s company as he gains more control. Elliott has proposed that Samsung Electronics divide itself into two publicly traded businesses: a holding company that would function as the Lee family\u2019s main ownership vehicle, and a separate company that would hold the electronics maker\u2019s operating businesses."]
["business/dealbook", "As part of that plan, the hedge fund proposed that the holding company merge with Samsung C&T, which now serves as the Lee family\u2019s holding company for the entire Samsung empire. In the event that the elder Mr. Lee dies, Korean law would require the family to pay a huge amount of inheritance taxes. They could then sell shares in the holding company to raise money for those payouts, Elliott is likely to argue. To reduce what the hedge fund called excessive cash reserves, Elliott also called for a special dividend of 245,000 won, or nearly $220, a share of Samsung Electronics, amounting to roughly $27 billion worth of payouts. The plan also proposed that 75 percent of the new operating company\u2019s cash flow be paid out as dividends. The holding company could remain traded on the Korean stock exchange, but Elliott called for the operating company to be listed on Nasdaq as well to provide greater visibility into the business. The hedge fund also called for each of the new companies\u2019 boards to add at least three independent directors. Representatives for Samsung did not respond for comment."]
["nyregion", "A Truce: Legions of Yankee Haters Are Temporary Rooters - The New York Times Just look at them, Yankee haters always say: fans who make a simple hello sound like a taunt, ballplayers who make enough money to buy their kids the Milwaukee Brewers for Christmas, and an owner who dresses like Thurston Howell III. And enough already with that storied-history blather that has Bob Costas getting weepy every time a Yankee hits a bloop single. You've won a lot of World Series; got it. It has long been considered an inalienable right, if not an obligation, for most of the country to loathe the New York Yankees, for reasons beyond the team's galling habit of winning. That hatred, passed on within families like a lovingly polished heirloom, also has to do with the big-city, big-money entitlement that the New York franchise exudes -- a sense that if the Yankees do not win the World Series, it does not count somehow. But the events of Sept. 11 have rattled almost every aspect of daily life in the United States, including the national diversion of baseball. Now, as the Yankees prepare to play the Arizona Diamondbacks in their fourth consecutive World Series -- they have won four of the last five -- the once-clear boundaries of fan loyalty have become blurred by disaster."]
["nyregion", "Before the 11th, the question was never whether you hated the Yankees, but rather how deep was your hatred. After the 11th, it is: Can you root against a team from an injured city that lost thousands of people in last month's terrorist attack? Judging from interviews conducted around the country and in New York -- where there exists a Yankee-loathing breed known as Mets fans -- it is clear that for many, a time-limited rapprochement has been achieved: they will root for the Yankees, but just this once! That sentiment made for an odd scene at a Georgia conference center Monday night: people from around the country were gathered around a television set, rooting for the Yankees -- the Yankees! -- to beat the Seattle Mariners and win the American League pennant. ''It's counterintuitive to what we would normally expect,'' said Chris Brown, a St. Louis Cardinals fan from Chicago who was among those rooting for New York that night, and who hopes the Yankees win the World Series. ''It seems like the right thing, that they should win -- for the city, for the country.'' Others, though, say that they have developed a love-hate approach: love the city, hate the Yankees. Then there are the likes of Chris McGlynn. A devoted Mets fan from Bethpage, on Long Island, he said that he had taken the admonition from the country's leaders to ''go back to the normalcy of your life.''"]
["nyregion", "''That means I'll probably be pulling for the Diamondbacks,'' said Mr. McGlynn, 38, a sales trader who lost his job on Wall Street after the terrorist attack. ''Because, you know, enough's enough.'' People, even entire cities, can despise the Yankees for reasons that are recent (Derek Jeter overload) or historic (the Boston Red Sox's selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1919), emotional (seeing Donald Trump in the stands) or statistical (the Yankees have won 26 World Series). They can also border on the familial. Bill Simmons, who writes a sports column from Boston for ESPN.com, said that many Red Sox fans would root against the Yankees simply because of Roger Clemens, the hulking Yankee pitcher. ''He alone is why some people are rooting against the Yankees,'' Mr. Simmons said of Mr. Clemens, a former Red Sox star whose glower stopped charming Boston the second he left town. Perhaps no fans root harder against the Yankees than those who root for the Red Sox. It is not sport with them; it is personal. Ask the radio personality Jonathan Schwartz what he thinks about the Yankees and he mutters: ''I find them on any level and at any time irrevocably loathsome. I swear to you.'' Uh, O.K. But did the events of Sept. 11 make him want to cheer the Yankees on to World Series victory?"]
["nyregion", "''For no reason do you suddenly feel the opposite emotion of what you have experienced your entire life,'' said Mr. Schwartz, 62, who grew up in Manhattan. ''That other kids took your Red Sox hat off and pushed it in the toilet. That you've seldom gone to bed in all those decades when you did not know the Red Sox final score.'' ''New York's tragedy was a national tragedy,'' he added. ''Not only is it a national tragedy, it's a Boston tragedy.'' But Al Johnson, 54, a Red Sox fan who runs a newsstand in Cambridge, Mass., said that he could not separate team from city. Not only has he lost his appetite for talking down the Yankees, he said, but he is also displaying signs that trumpet his change of heart (''Good Luck Yankees''). ''It's driving some people crazy,'' he admitted. ''I know a couple of sports fans; regardless of the tragedy, they still don't want the Yankees to win. I said, 'Come on, lighten up.' I think New York needs a lot of loving right now.'' That sentiment was echoed by Lou Piniella, the Seattle Mariners manager, who said that as his team was losing the pennant Monday night, he looked around packed Yankee Stadium and thought: Good for them. Even Skip Rimsza, the mayor of Phoenix, the hometown of the Diamondbacks, said this week that ''there's no question that in many ways the Yankees are going to have the empathy of the country.''"]
["nyregion", "Miles Crakow, a copywriter from Los Angeles, agreed. That did not mean that he had forgotten how the Yankees beat his beloved Dodgers in the 1977 and 1978 World Series, or that he was suddenly embracing New York's decidedly anti-L.A. approach to life, which he suggested might be described as arrogance. ''But at a time like this, that's not necessarily a bad thing to cheer for: for that New York attitude to come back,'' he said. ''This year only.'' Terry Healy, a bar owner who was sitting at the counter of Harry Caray's Restaurant in Chicago yesterday, said that he, too, found it easier to root for the Yankees now. ''Our hearts go out to the people of New York, and that means everything,'' he said. ''They're hurting; if this can help them, then yeah. But you've got to remember that it's not easy for everybody to give up those alliances.'' That's for sure. At the same restaurant, Dan Maslauski, a real-estate broker, explained that he came from Springfield, Ill., where people either root for the Cardinals or the Cubs, ''but we all hated the Yankees.'' He acknowledged that a World Series victory might be good for the traumatized city of New York, a city that he said he loved, but he took pains to make distinctions. ''Certain things don't change in the time of a national emergency,'' he said, adding: ''This is sports, and it has nothing to do with the tragedy or the city. It's baseball.''"]
["nyregion", "Any final hopes that a country would embrace the Yankees in a kind of we-are-the-world hug were dashed the other night at the Hillside Caf\u00e9 in Newport, R.I., a Red Sox stronghold. There, an insurance agent named Alan Corcoran was renewing his anti-Yankee vows with friends, saving particular venom for Mr. Clemens's ritual of rubbing the Babe Ruth monument at Yankee Stadium before heading out to pitch. ''When he comes on to the field and pats Babe Ruth on the head, I hope he bites his finger,'' Mr. Corcoran said. Then his cell phone rang. It was a like-minded friend from Florida. His caller ID read: ''Yankee Hater 211.''"]
["education/edlife", "Everything You Need to Know About the New SAT - The New York Times The new SAT will soon arrive on a wave of bold promises. The College Board has said its redesigned admission test would contain \u201cno more mysteries.\u201d Instead of being a riddle to solve, it would correspond with high-school curriculums and better reflect what students have learned. The pitch sounds good. But is it true? In the spirit of good prep, let\u2019s review what we know so far. The new SAT, which debuts in March, will look a lot different from the current version. Instead of three sections, there will be two: Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing. Each will be scored on a 200-to-800 scale. There will no longer be a penalty for guessing, and the odds will be better (the number of possible answers will decrease from 5 to 4). The now-required essay will be optional. As for content, the revamped test draws heavily from the Common Core \u2014 math and reading benchmarks adopted by most states. Those standards emphasize evidence-based interpretations of texts, vocabulary used in college and careers, and depth-over-breadth math skills. And yes, although the exam will not be the mirror image of the ACT, the two are about to become much more similar. The changes get mixed reviews. Some testing experts who\u2019ve studied the College Board\u2019s sample questions describe them as more relevant and less gimmicky. Others foresee problems, especially for those who struggle with reading."]
["education/edlife", "\u201cThe new SAT will align better with what kids are learning in school,\u201d said Ned Johnson, founder of PrepMatters, a test-preparation service in Bethesda, Md., and co-author of \u201cConquering the SAT.\u201d \u201cBut if you haven\u2019t gone to a school that\u2019s prepared you well, the test isn\u2019t going to serve you well.\u201d Although the SAT is evolving, not all of its stripes are changing. Test-taking savvy is still going to make a big difference when students pick up those No. 2 pencils. So let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the changes \u2014 and why they matter. First, the reading section won\u2019t be so \u201crecondite,\u201d because obscure words like that are disappearing. The test will no longer ask students to complete sentences. Now they will have to derive the meaning of widely used words based on context. Test takers should expect to see words that can be used in different ways (\u201cmeasured,\u201d \u201cdisposed\u201d). Instead of recalling a definition from vocabulary flash cards, they\u2019ll have to read prose passages carefully to choose an answer. How should students prepare? By reading often and diving into various kinds of texts, especially nonfiction, tutors say. That\u2019s more a long-term strategy than a quick test-prep trick. Habitual reading can also help on the writing section, which will demand prolonged concentration. To answer questions about grammar, punctuation and usage, students will have to wade through extended passages relating to history, humanities and science."]
["education/edlife", "What\u2019s true of the writing section is true of the new SAT in general: There\u2019s much more to read. \u201cThe most fundamental change is that there are many, many more words,\u201d said Aaron Golumbfskie, education director for PrepMatters. \u201cIf you don\u2019t read well and happily, this test isn\u2019t going to be your friend.\u201d Even the math section will require more reading, with fewer questions based on equations and more word problems. Some prompts will present the same type of real-world situations that the Common Core emphasizes \u2014 \u201cThe recommended daily calcium intake for a 20-year-old is 1,000 milligrams (mg). One cup of milk contains 299 mg....\u201d Mr. Golumbfskie describes the math section as \u201ctighter in focus.\u201d The current test covers a lot of ground, with a question or two on each topic; the new one will drill down into a few key areas. Geometry is fading out. Algebra is stepping up: Prepare for linear equations and inequalities, and systems of equations in two variables. The addition of more-advanced math, such as trigonometry, means the test will cover material from a greater number of courses. That will make it more difficult for students to take the SAT early. Some questions will require knowledge of statistics, a course relatively few students take in high school. And because one math section will prohibit the use of a calculator, students who use them in class may want to practice tackling calculations with pencil and paper."]
["education/edlife", "After getting through all that math, test takers who opt to write the essay will have a much different assignment than they do today. The prompts, which will look familiar to those who\u2019ve taken Advanced Placement English, ask for a critical response to a specific argument. In: analysis. Out: writing about your personal experiences. For example: Read excerpts from a 1967 speech by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and explain how he used evidence, reasoning and/or stylistic elements to support his argument that American involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust. As much as any other modification, the new essay captures the spirit of the new SAT, which underscores the importance of evidence. Questions throughout will require students to cite specific examples that support their answers. No longer can they get by on writing skills alone. With all the new stuff to consider, it\u2019s easy to forget about what\u2019s not changing. At 3 hours 50 minutes (with the essay), the SAT is still a long, exhausting test. Besides measuring what students have learned, it will measure how they perform under pressure in a high-stakes situation \u2014 just like the old model. Adam Ingersoll, a founder of Compass Education Group, a California test-prep service, said the College Board has made the SAT more resistant to the beat-the-test strategies his industry is known for teaching: \u201cThe mysteriousness of the test \u2014 they are actively trying to bleed that out.\u201d"]
["education/edlife", "But maybe not completely. While poring over sample questions, Mr. Ingersoll spotted the same \u201ctrap doors\u201d \u2014 questions designed to distract or confuse and to enhance the test\u2019s difficulty \u2014 that he finds in the current version. Colleges use the SAT to sort applicants, and a wide distribution of scores helps them do that. \u201cYou can\u2019t have all students getting a 750,\u201d Mr. Ingersoll said. \u201cIt needs to be a benchmark of students\u2019 achievement, but that is at odds with selective colleges\u2019 need to have a test that sorts and ranks. These quirks and trap doors make the test perform the way it needs to.\u201d So the big question burning up the web: Which version should I take? The answer could come down to timing. Students have just three more chances to take the current SAT \u2014 the last testing date is Jan. 23. One advantage of sticking with the current version: It\u2019s a known quantity, and plenty of review materials exist. Those who were happy with their PSAT scores might want to take the soon-to-be-old SAT, which would look familiar to them. \u201cThere\u2019s not a test-prep tutor anywhere who could look a family in the eye and say, \u2018We can do as good a job for you on the new SAT this year,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mr. Ingersoll said. Most students take the SAT for the first time in spring of their junior year. Those who don\u2019t want to rush might decide that the new test, though less familiar, fits their schedule better. But remember this: The first cohort to take the new SAT, in March, won\u2019t get their scores until after the next test date, in May. That\u2019s about double the current wait time."]
["education/edlife", "The second question everyone is asking: Is the new test harder? No, several test preppers insist, though some students might stumble over the longer reading passages, the deeper dive into math and questions that require multiple steps to reach an answer. Those concerns could drive many students to take the old test \u2014 or the ACT. Some expect that the new SAT will be even more challenging for the disadvantaged. By weaving more tightly into high-school curriculum, the test would seem to best serve students at high-performing schools, with the strong teachers who prepare them for state standards, as well as affluent students with access to test prep. \u201cThere\u2019s a new body style on the Chevrolet, but it has zero to do with performance \u2014 the engine\u2019s the same,\u201d said Jay Rosner, the Princeton Review Foundation\u2019s executive director, who tutors low-income and underrepresented minority students. \u201cIt\u2019s going to generate the same hierarchy of scores that exists now.\u201d"]
["sports/basketball", "With Return of Anthony, Knicks Quietly Edge Ahead - The New York Times Ah, Carmelo, you coquette, it\u2019s good to have you back. Carmelo Anthony passed the last few weeks batting his eyes at one franchise after another, listening to sweet nothings whispered in his ear. Chicago, in particular, tugged at his hemline. But in the end he proclaimed himself always and forever in love with the Knicks, and so returned to his less-than-illustrious 37-win team. Perhaps Anthony\u2019s decision was helped along by an \u201com mani padme hum\u201d from Phil Jackson, the team\u2019s president and guru, who spoke of achieving mind meld with Anthony. I would take a wild guess that James L. Dolan\u2019s decision to ante up what is expected to be slightly less than the $130 million Anthony could command also played a role. And that\u2019s fine. Anthony is that strangest of N.B.A. beasts, an underrated star who last season averaged 27.4 points and 8.1 rebounds a game. It\u2019s difficult to watch him night after night and not respect his craft. He is a terrific, defenders-hanging-on-his-shoulders shooter. He rebounds ably. His penchant for slowing the game to a crawl while he jab-steps and fakes can drive you to distraction. But he is also a smart passer \u2014 when he has a couple of teammates who can stick a 20-foot jumper. He had no such helpers last season."]
["sports/basketball", "Even with Anthony\u2019s return, however, it has been relatively quiet days for New York hoops. Cleveland\u2019s deserving fans and its boorish owner got hit by a bolt of N.B.A. lightning in the form of LeBron James. The Miami Heat watched their franchise cornerstone slide into Biscayne Bay. The Wizards\u2019 young stars gained a veteran\u2019s steadying hand, and the Houston Rockets tossed proposed contracts at one star after another before ending up more or less where they began. In Brooklyn, Mikhail D. Prokhorov marketed himself last summer as a hipster Russian oligarch, charming writers and Nets fans and tossing about rubles with abandon. Now a Moscow chill has set in. Jason Kidd, the Nets\u2019 Machiavellian coach, tried to execute a coup against his general manager and slid out the door for Milwaukee. The Nets\u2019 roster has diminished by the day. The latest player to step into the Nets\u2019 departure lounge was Paul Pierce, who took his aging warrior\u2019s heart and still-sweet touch to the Wizards. The Nets chose not to match Pierce\u2019s contract offer. The team is bereft of draft picks, millions of dollars over the luxury cap and staring down the barrel of, perhaps, a 43-win season. Good luck \u2014 or as they say it Russia, Udachi \u2014 big guy. The Knicks over the past 14 years are a team caught between Dolan\u2019s foot-stomping urgency of now and a more sensible commitment to a gut rehab. Jackson appears to have split the difference. Retaining Anthony represents a down payment on the present, while leaving the door ajar to a brighter future a year from now, when Jackson can clear several back-straining and moribund contracts from the roster."]
["sports/basketball", "He evicted the Knicks\u2019 pudgy point guard, the egregious Raymond Felton, and the team\u2019s too-often-injured center, Tyson Chandler. In return Jackson reeled in the well-regarded point guard Jose Calderon. And he may have plucked two rough-hewed diamonds in the second round of the N.B.A. draft. The Knicks\u2019 roster has weapons, sort of. Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, when healthy \u2014 perhaps the N.B.A.\u2019s biggest caveat \u2014 is still a skilled player. Tim Hardaway Jr. displayed impressive athleticism and a nice shot. Typing the name J. R. Smith induces a shudder: he of the shoelace untying, and testing-positive-for-marijuana-study in perpetual adolescence. But he can score and defend when the spirit moves him. Defense is another matter. Andrea Bargnani, Stoudemire and Calderon are established defensive laggards. As for Hardaway, he played defense like a fawn trying to cross the New York State Thruway, an exercise in cluelessness. Hardaway, however, is young and athletic, and if Derek Fisher, the rookie coach, can teach him the rudiments of lateral movement, improvement seems likely. Oddly, given Anthony\u2019s skills, the offense is more troubled. A year ago, the previous Knicks management executed a perfectly clueless summer. They let their 3-point shooting specialists Steve Novak and Chris Copeland, the very fellows who converted Anthony\u2019s passes into points, depart. And they imported Bargnani, an out-of-shape, sporadically motivated 7-foot center who would hurt his arm trying to pull off a spectacularly ill-advised dunk. The once-promising Iman Shumpert\u2019s shooting called to mind a kid hurling rocks at a distant can."]
["sports/basketball", "So Anthony was left to shoot, and shoot again. When the team played with no days off, or one day\u2019s rest, his teammates most often went to sleep. Not Anthony. He scored most in times of high fatigue. The bill of indictment against Anthony is that he is not a true leader. That could be. Nor is his basketball talent the equal of James\u2019s or Kevin Durant\u2019s. But he is game, and more or less tireless. If there is a true shaft of sunlight to be seen at Fortress M.S.G., it\u2019s that Dolan, the Knicks\u2019 very own Mount Etna, has remained quiet. Dolan\u2019s eruptions are impressive, torching coaches and rebuilding plans with disquieting regularity. It\u2019s too early to declare Dolan dormant. He hired Jackson only a few months ago.

A week after the Boston Marathon attack, which was unraveled after the release of video footage of the two suspects flushed them out of hiding, 78 percent of people said surveillance cameras were a good idea, the poll found.

For all that confidence, there are lingering questions about the role of the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies before the attacks, with people divided about whether they had collected information that could have prevented them (41 percent said they had; 45 percent said they had not). The murkiness of the case \u2014 the Tsarnaev brothers\u2019 ties to the Caucasus; the warnings from Russian intelligence about potential extremist sympathies \u2014 has clearly left an impression on the public.

Sixty-six percent said information about how to make explosives should not be allowed on the Internet, where it would be available to aspiring terrorists, even if some would view that as a form of censorship. Thirty percent said it should be permitted in the interest of free expression.

["world/asia", "Buffalo Meat Industry Facing Government Shutdowns in India - The New York Times NARAHARA, India \u2014 In recent years, as demand for cheap protein raged in China and the Persian Gulf countries, India quietly became the world\u2019s largest exporter of meat \u2014 chiefly flash-frozen water buffalo, which approached $5 billion in exports in 2015. Slaughterhouses proliferated in the west of Uttar Pradesh, and the surrounding villages underwent an economic transformation. Children raised on plain roti began to eat lentils twice a day. But that spurt of prosperity came under threat this week, when a new Hindu-right government in the state, led by the fiery cleric Yogi Adityanath, began shutting down parts of the Muslim-dominated buffalo meat industry. Hindu activists say the industry conceals the illegal slaughter of cows, which are sacred to Hindus. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s governing party has long balanced its commitment to export-driven development against its embrace of right-wing Hindu causes, it has rarely made such a stark choice between them. The state\u2019s new leaders promise more meat factories will be shut in the coming days, and they say the blow to the economy is less important than the principle of protecting the cow. \u201cThe government should do it on moral grounds,\u201d said Karunesh Nandan Garg, 57, president of the Meerut division of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. He cited the example of prostitution in Thailand, which is largely tolerated by the authorities and \u201ca major revenue producer\u201d there. \u201cBut is that right? Money isn\u2019t everything.\u201d"]
["world/asia", "Uttar Pradesh is India\u2019s largest meat-producing state, with 41 of the country\u2019s 75 licensed slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, according to the Commerce Ministry. Scores more operate without licenses, and an exhaustive list of laws govern the slaughter, transport and sale of meat, so the government can easily find a pretext to shut even licensed businesses. On Hapur Road, which is lined with slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, economic activity had ground to a halt within days of Mr. Adityanath\u2019s swearing-in. District officials sealed seven factories in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday, citing irregularities in paperwork. The police were ordered to patrol the plants and search vehicles for cows, so frightening suppliers that they stopped delivering buffaloes. Workers, told to go home for the day, had instead gathered in tea stalls, nervously trading reports. \u201cWe are waiting to see what the government decides,\u201d said Muhammad Akhtar, a migrant from Bihar who has worked in the meat factories for 20 years, earning around 10,000 rupees, about $150, in a good month. \u201cModi has said he wants economic development for everyone,\u201d Mr. Akhtar said. \u201cThis job has allowed my children to eat and go to school. All we want is peace, to be allowed to work in peace.\u201d Life in this strip of villages had changed drastically with the advent of the meat factories a decade ago, people here said. Mud huts, which routinely collapsed during the monsoon, had been replaced by solid brick buildings. Men working in the factories had begun to invest in motor scooters. Women had been pulled into the work force, abruptly doubling family incomes."]

Other men clustered around him \u2014 peddlers, truck dispatchers, factory supervisors, cleaners, butchers. Some of them warned that further pressure on the industry would lead to violence. \u201cSuppose that there are five people in a single family working here, and they are all jobless,\u201d said Muhammad Majid, 21, who has been working at a slaughterhouse since he was 15. \u201cIf there are riots, they will be difficult to contain.\u201d Most Indians were not aware that buffalo meat overtook rice as the country\u2019s largest food export in 2015. The industry\u2019s growth has gone unnoticed mainly because of religious sensitivities: Meatpacking, like leather, is a sector dominated by Muslims, who make up around 19 percent of this state\u2019s population. Though it is legal to slaughter buffalo when they are old and can no longer give milk, right-wing Hindu groups have long suggested that cows were being spirited into the facilities, and they have routinely intercepted supply vehicles for aggressive searches. In January, in its manifesto ahead of Uttar Pradesh\u2019s state elections, the B.J.P. promised to take a step further: to shut down \u201call illegal slaughterhouses\u201d and restrict mechanized ones.

When that proved unpersuasive, he charged out onto the roadway after Mr. Chaturvedi, his hands shaking with rage and anxiety. He shouted to a waiting camera crew that the inspector had for years solicited bribes, most recently of 200,000 rupees.

["us", "Cloning Used In an Effort To Preserve Rare Species - The New York Times In what could represent a new way to save endangered species, scientists at a Massachusetts biotechnology company said yesterday that they had cloned an endangered Asian gaur and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow in Iowa. The baby gaur, an oxlike creature that is native to India and Southeast Asia, is expected to be born next month. If the birth of the gaur is successful, it would represent the first cloning of an endangered species and the first cloned animal to use another species as a surrogate mother. Scientists say the technique could not only help preserve endangered species but also revive species that have already become extinct. The company, Advanced Cell Technology, of Worcester, Mass.,  said yesterday that it had received permission from the government of Spain to clone the already extinct bucardo mountain goat, using cells collected from the last goat before she died earlier this year. The company is also looking at cloning giant pandas using black bears as surrogate mothers and frozen cells from Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, pandas at the National Zoo in Washington that have already died. But the technique, which seems right out of ''Jurassic Park,'' is raising ethical questions. Some conservationists fear that cloning would detract from other, less costly efforts at preserving habitat. And some say it is still not known whether an animal raised by a mother of a different species will be able to thrive in the wild."]
["us", "''It's more like an amusement park version of the species rather than the wild species,'' said Kent Redford, director of biodiversity analysis and coordination at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. ''We want to preserve a whole lot more than the genetic material,'' he added, saying species should be preserved in their natural environments. ''That can't be reproduced in some Frankenstein lab.'' Robert P. Lanza, vice president for medical and scientific development at Advanced Cell Technology, said cloning would help reverse damage to wildlife habitat by people. He urged zoos and wildlife officials to begin collecting and freezing tissue samples of endangered species. ''For a few dollars of electricity you can preserve the genes of all the pandas in China,'' Mr. Lanza said. He also said cloning was not likely to work on species that had been extinct for a long time because it would be difficult or impossible to find intact DNA. ''You're certainly not going to be seeing dinosaurs in your backyard any time soon,'' he said. To create the gaur, scientists took a skin cell from a recently deceased gaur and fused it with a cow's egg from which the chromosomes, containing the cow's genetic material, had been removed. The DNA of the gaur commandeered the egg, which grew into a gaur embryo. The embryo was implanted in the womb of a cow serving as a surrogate mother. The baby, which will be named Noah, should be an exact genetic copy of the gaur from which the skin cell was obtained. The procedure was reported yesterday in The Washington Post."]
["us", "Previously, many scientists thought such cross-species cloning would be impossible because the DNA of the cloned animal would not be able to interact properly with the rest of the egg cell. The technique failed many more times than it succeeded. The scientists created several hundred embryos, but only 81 grew to the stage where they could be implanted. Some 42 were implanted in 32 cows, but only eight cows became pregnant. The fetuses were extracted from two cows for examination, and five cows suffered spontaneous abortions, leaving only one cow that is still pregnant. Based on the examination of the fetuses, Dr. Lanza said, the gaurs seemed to be normal, not crosses between cows and gaurs. Dr. Lanza said cows were used as egg donors and surrogate mothers because there are so few gaurs left that it would be unethical to round up wild female gaurs and subject them to the treatments needed to extract eggs and implant embryos. And for creatures that are already extinct, he said, there would be no choice but to use other species as egg donors and surrogate mothers. There have been cases of animals of one species being born to surrogate mothers of another species, such as a house cat giving birth to an African wildcat. But in these cases the implanted embryos were not the result of cloning."]

But the attention to the selection of the secretary general is also a measure of concern about the credibility of the United Nations as a whole and the worry that its top jobs are controlled by the most powerful countries. The letter remains vague on two divisive elements.

["world/africa", "Islamist Militants Storm Hotel in Somalia, Killing at Least 6 - The New York Times NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Islamist militants stormed a hotel in central Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital, on Saturday afternoon, killing at least six people in what has become a well-established tactic to sow terror. According to witnesses and government officials, the attack started around 4 p.m. with a car bomb at the gates of the Naso Hablod Hotel, before fighters ran in and shot at guests. The Shabab militant group, which has been terrorizing Somalia for nearly a decade and claimed responsibility for the attack, has struck at least four other hotels in Mogadishu in the past year. A deafening car bomb at the hotel gates is typically how such attacks begin. American-trained commandos from Somalia\u2019s security services killed all four attackers after a shootout that lasted several hours, said Abdikamil Moalim Shukri, a spokesman for Somalia\u2019s Internal Security Ministry. Witnesses said the attackers appeared to be tactically proficient, fighting their way into the hotel and then firing on government security forces from the rooftop. Mohamed Mohamud, the hotel\u2019s bookkeeper, said he was locking up his office and about to perform evening prayers when he heard a huge explosion outside. He looked up to see several gunmen rush into the hotel, and he hid near his office. \u201cI\u2019m shocked but thank God I\u2019m safe,\u201d he said. Somalia has been synonymous with chaos and bloodshed since the central government collapsed in 1991, sending the country into a tailspin of clan violence and widespread destruction. The government controls little territory and struggles to maintain security even inside the capital."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE IMAGE; Tested and Occasionally Tripped, Bush May Yet Rue a Mirror Crack'd - The New York Times Now that voters have finally begun to pay close attention to the presidential race, many strategists say that Gov. George W. Bush has to be particularly careful not to lose control of what has long been his most potent advantage over Vice President Al Gore: his personal image. For all the debate over who has the most gripping television commercials, an important way to see how a campaign is performing is in the day-to-day media coverage. By that measure, Mr. Gore has enjoyed nearly a month of flattering attention, and Mr. Bush -- while still neck and neck in the polls -- has been portrayed as a candidate struggling to recover from verbal flubs and tactical blunders, some of his own making and some entirely beyond his control. The challenge for the Bush campaign, according to some of his own advisers and Republicans outside the campaign, is to prevent the public from developing the perception that he is not quite ready for prime time. The longtime view of many of these Republicans has been that Mr. Bush's political attraction is anchored as much in his personality as in his stands on issues: They say he comes across as a regular, upbeat guy without pretension, one who is appealingly self-confident and responsible, and one who is not afraid to say when he does not have an answer."]
["us", "The success of his ''compassionate conservative'' mantra was that Mr. Bush was not a scowling extremist but a sunny and appealing politician who could effectively carry the conservative message. Now, some of Mr. Bush's supporters and advisers sense that these appealing traits have not broken  through to voters. From his tongue-twisted explanations of his tax plan to his reluctance to accept a bipartisan commission's roster of debates and even to his vulgar comment about a reporter, Mr. Bush has seemed defensive, lacking in humor and easily flappable, these supporters say. Don Sipple, a Republican media consultant who worked for Mr. Bush when he ran for governor of Texas, said, ''If there is a substantial deterioration in voters' perceptions of his personal traits that is met with a commensurate rise on the part of Gore, that becomes very problematic.'' ''His personal qualities had so much to do with his ascent on the national stage,'' Mr. Sipple added,  ''and he needs to take great care in preserving those.'' Michael K. Deaver, who was an image consultant for Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Bush's challenge reminded him of what his boss faced in 1980, when he was widely derided after saying that 80 percent of air pollution came from plants and trees. ''We had the problem of so-called misstatements and the jokes on late-night television,'' Mr. Deaver said. ''When you get into this you have to change your message dramatically. Bush has got some vulnerability on misspeaking and mispronouncing. The media are looking at him in a different way, and he has to be cognizant of that.''"]
["us", "Most polls so far show that the movement has been in Mr. Gore's column. He is gaining in popularity, and likability, while Mr. Bush is holding his own. But beyond the overall numbers, some pollsters in both parties said they had detected signs of erosion in how the governor is viewed as a person. Now that the months of publicity about Mr. Gore's inability to connect with voters has subsided in the glow of the Democratic National Convention and tightened polls, Democrats are happy to pronounce Mr. Bush as the one with the problem. Democratic officials made available a party poll of likely voters, completed on Thursday, in which respondents were asked whether Mr. Bush ''sometimes seems a little arrogant.'' While voters were divided on that question, the Democrats said they found an increase of several percentage points since the Republican convention in the number of people who said yes. Mr. Gore's ratings have shifted so fast, and so unexpectedly, that the newly warm feelings voters have toward him could evaporate. Last week, the Bush camp was clearly trying to nudge such a shift along, as it pointed to fresh accusations about the Democrats' solicitation of money from trial lawyers. Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster, insisted that Mr. Bush's image troubles were the imagination of the media. ''The disparaging, sneering image of Governor Bush that you sense among the media elite is not reflected by most voters,'' Mr. Ayres said. ''That's why he maintains his strength in the polls.''"]
["us", "That may be the case. But there is no mistaking that these days, antics of Mr. Gore that might have been seen as forced and silly a month ago now are being described through the prism of the media and the pundits as evidence that the vice president, finally, is now comfortable allowing people to see his true disposition. Right or wrong, officials in both campaigns agreed that perceptions about a candidate's stature, personality and electoral strength could be as critical to voters as the candidate's stands on issues. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said in an interview weeks ago that both sides had to take care because if one candidate was seen to be on an upswing, voters might be tempted to join up with a winner. The swing voters who decide elections, Mr. Rove explained, are ''people largely driven less by issues and more by personalities and the so-called bandwagon effect: who looks like they're going to win.'' Perhaps the best evidence that the Bush campaign is now worried about Mr. Bush's image -- or no longer sees that as his No. 1 advantage -- is its decision to focus more attention on issues and less on raising questions about Mr. Gore's character. But even some Bush advisers acknowledge that the strategy may be perilous because polls show that voters generally give Democrats higher marks on the issues."]
["us", "There is something of a circular phenomenon here. Mr. Bush's gaffes on the stump are nothing new, but they are being picked up more by the media because the context of the campaign has changed and the governor is no longer viewed as the towering favorite. The more critical coverage could contribute to a damaging of Mr. Bush's image, which, if reflected in the polls, could result in  still more critical coverage. ''Bush picked the worst time to start getting terrible press,'' said S. Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ''Journalists are setting the story line for the whole campaign.'' ''When you're doing well,'' he explained, ''journalists don't focus on your gaffes or goofs because they don't seem to make any difference. When he starts to falter, the residue of stereotypes comes back into play: that Bush is a lightweight.'' Bush officials have privately said that their biggest fear was that people would begin to question their candidate's weightiness. Now, many Republicans said, with the Olympics in progress, they are particularly worried that Mr. Bush will probably  not have a chance to define himself better until the first of his three debates with Mr. Gore, on Oct. 3. ''The next real step for Bush is to make a good showing at the debates,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. ''Bush is in the same kind of dangerous slide that Dukakis was in in '88 when he jumped into the tank and put the funny hat on.''"]
["us", "Mr. Deaver insisted there was ample time for the Bush camp to protect how he is perceived. The campaign, he said, should assert stricter control over Mr. Bush's public appearances and press for bolder events and policy proposals. ''They have to do something that's different and dramatic,'' Mr. Deaver said. Asked what would that be, he replied, ''I don't know.''"]

One establishes an enforceable ban on racial profiling. The other creates the position of inspector general, an official with sweeping powers to review Police Department policies. Both deserve to pass. The Council began focusing on this issue legislatively as far back as 2001, when it required the Police Department to submit quarterly reports detailing its stop-and-frisk activity, including information about the race and gender of those who had been stopped. Then, in 2004, concerned about the program\u2019s effect on minority residents, the Council prohibited the use of racial or ethnic profiling. Neither measure has been effective. The stop-and-frisk program still disproportionately affects minority residents, and it has become the subject of three federal lawsuits. In Floyd v. the City of New York, plaintiffs argue that the Police Department is stopping and frisking people based on race rather than reasonable suspicion of criminal behavior. If a federal court rules against the city, it could potentially install a monitor to oversee reforms. Unlike the 2004 bill, the new one would give people who believe they have been treated unfairly the right to sue for redress. It would not provide for monetary damages, but instead would allow a state court judge to declare the police behavior illegal and order the department to address the problem."]

["world/middleeast", "Iraq Declines Offer of U.S. Helicopters for Fight Against ISIS, Pentagon Chief Says - The New York Times BAGHDAD \u2014  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq declined to take up the Pentagon on its recent offer to speed up the fight against Islamic State fighters in Ramadi with the help of American attack helicopters, officials said on Wednesday. \u201cThe prime minister did not make any specific requests in connection with helicopters,\u201d Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter told reporters after he met with the Iraqi leader here. Mr. Carter made it clear that Mr. Abadi had not ruled out the use of the Apache helicopters in future operations, which are expected to be especially challenging as Iraqi forces look toward the battle for Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, which was captured in June 2014 by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Carter also insisted that neither Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, the American military commander who is leading the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, nor the Iraqi prime minister believed that the Apaches were needed \u201cright now\u201d to win back Ramadi, the capital of Iraq\u2019s Anbar Province, which is the site of protracted fighting between Islamic State militants and Iraqi ground troops. But Mr. Carter told Congress just a week ago that the United States had offered to have American-piloted Apaches fight with Iraqi forces as the Iraqi Army sought to complete its capture of the city. The United States, he noted, has also offered to deploy American advisers with Iraqi brigades on the battlefield instead of restricting them to bases inside Iraq, another proposal the Iraqis have yet to accept."]
["world/middleeast", "\u201cThe United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisers, if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister Abadi,\u201d Mr. Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee. The meeting between the American defense secretary and the Iraqi prime minister underscored two factors shaping the American-led campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq: the Obama administration\u2019s reluctance to significantly expand the role of American troops in Iraq, and the reluctance of Iraq\u2019s Shiite-dominated government to accept highly visible forms of American military support in the face of pressure from hard-line Shiite politicians and the Iranians. It also raised questions about the Obama administration\u2019s plans to intensify its campaign against the Islamic State militants. In recent weeks, the Pentagon has spoken of the \u201caccelerants\u201d it is planning to introduce to hasten the demise of the Islamic State. The Iraqi government, however, has yet to embrace two of the important \u201caccelerants\u201d \u2014 the Apaches and the deployment of American advisers in the field. Mr. Carter disclosed the Apache offer to American lawmakers after it had been conveyed privately to Mr. Abadi. Iraqi officials said the public nature of Mr. Carter\u2019s statements, which appear intended to reassure Congress that the Obama administration was stepping up its efforts against the Islamic State, put the prime minister, who has already been weakened by a series of bruising struggles with his political rivals, in a difficult spot."]
["world/middleeast", "\u201cThis is a very complex environment,\u201d General MacFarland said, somewhat philosophically. \u201cIt is kind of hard to inflict support on somebody.\u201d According to United States officials, the Pentagon\u2019s offer to support Iraqi forces with American Apaches was more qualified than it first appeared. Military commanders would have the authority to use the attack helicopters if Mr. Abadi agreed to their use and the risks of using them were judged to be acceptable. The deployment of Apaches in riskier situations would require further White House review, even if Mr. Abadi approved, United States officials added. American officials also said it would take weeks to deploy the advisers who would accompany Iraqi brigades on the battlefield even if Mr. Abadi were to agree to their presence. One important measure has been accepted in principle by Mr. Abadi: a new American special operations task force, which is to number fewer than 100. Seeking to reassure the prime minister, Mr. Carter said the task force\u2019s operations would require the approval of the Iraqi authorities. He suggested that some of its missions would take place near the Iraqi border with Syria, where they would receive less attention than those carried out near the Iraqi capital. \u201cEverything we do, of course, is subject to the approval of the sovereign Iraqi government,\u201d Mr. Carter said at the start of his meeting with Mr. Abadi, which also included Khaled al-Obeidi, Iraq\u2019s defense minister, and Lt.

The city, which is believed to be occupied by several hundred militants, has been surrounded by about 10,000 Iraqi troops. Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to be trapped in the town, and Islamic fighters have shot at some who have tried to flee, according to American officials. In their Tuesday counterattack, Islamic State militants took a bridge northwest of the city that spans the Euphrates, which the Iraqi Army had previously occupied. At the same time, militants sent several car bombs and a small group of fighters to attack the Anbar Operations Center, the Iraqi command that is overseeing the Ramadi campaign from north of the city. Both attacks were beaten back as American airstrikes enabled the Iraqi military to retake the bridge. Two Iraqi soldiers were killed as were several dozen Islamic State fighters, American officials said. By the end of Tuesday, both sides were back where they had started. It was unclear when Iraqi troops might break through the Islamic State\u2019s belts of improvised explosive devices and other defenses and push into the heart of the city."]
["world", "BOMBER DISGUISED AS ISRAELI SOLDIER KILLS 3 IN MARKET - The New York Times A suicide bomber disguised as an Israeli soldier blew himself apart on Sunday in a cramped market aisle here, ending almost two weeks of relative quiet in Israel by killing 3 Israelis and wounding more than 50 with a shrapnel-packed bomb. It was the first suicide bombing since Yasir Arafat ordered his Palestinian security forces on May 8 to prevent ''all terror attacks against Israeli civilians,'' and it immediately overshadowed cautious political moves on both sides. The bombing suggested that Palestinian militants were no more intimidated by Israel's threats than they were by Mr. Arafat's. A senior Israeli security official warned last week that Israel was likely to invade the Gaza Strip after the next terrorist attack in Israel. There were no signs of such action Sunday night. The bombing, which spattered an aisle of cucumbers, cauliflower and green peppers with blood as the open-air market resounded with screams, followed a holiday weekend in which some Israelis returned to parks, shopping centers and cafes in the tentative hope that Israel's overwhelming West Bank offensive had forced a halt to suicide bombings. But as her 6-year-old daughter, Linori, lay in a hospital bed here Sunday night beneath a ''Sesame Street'' mobile with her face and body lacerated by shrapnel, Simi Buskila said the military operation had not made her feel safer. ''There's nothing that can guarantee that I can tell my children they can go outside and nothing bad will happen,'' she said."]
["world", "The Palestinian leadership issued a statement declaring ''full condemnation for the terror attack that targeted Israeli civilians.'' But Israeli officials called the bombing evidence that a ''Palestinian terror campaign'' continued unchecked. Another suicide bomber blew himself up early today after he was stopped for a security check at a highway junction near the city of Afula in northern Israel, Israeli police said. Authorities were alerted to the man, a Palestinian reportedly from the Jenin area, by an Israeli bystander who said he looked suspicious. There were no other casualties. In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney said Mr. Arafat could not be expected to stop all such attacks. ''On the other hand,'' he said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' ''there have in the past been bombings by elements of Palestinian organizations that come under his control, and there he clearly has the capacity to act.'' It was not immediately certain who was behind Sunday's attack, but members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a secular group, claimed responsibility. Israeli forces have continued moving freely through Palestinian-controlled territory in the West Bank, raiding towns and arresting and sometimes killing suspected militants in a rolling operation that Israel says is essential to its self-defense. The Bush administration says Israel should refrain from such incursions, but it has not emphasized that view."]
["world", "The Israeli operation began after a suicide bomber from the militant group Hamas killed 29 other people at the start of Passover in the Park Hotel, about six blocks from Sunday's attack. Israel's coastal plain, including Netanya, just north of Tel Aviv, was under high alert this afternoon because security officials had warned of a planned attack about an hour before the bomber struck. Superintendent Gil Kleiman, a police spokesman, said the bomber had worn an army uniform. The torn breast pocket of an olive uniform, soaked in blood, lay at the site of the bombing, amid scattered onions and cabbages and shrapnel nails. At least six of the wounded were said to be in serious condition. Superintendent Kleiman noted that there had been a marked reduction in terrorist attacks and Israeli casualties since the end of March. ''But it's not like we're going home,'' he added. ''Our work is still cut out for us.'' Around the corner from Sunday's attack, Shaul Navah, 50, said the Israeli operation had accomplished nothing significant. ''There isn't a day or a place I feel safe anymore,'' said Mr. Navah, the owner of a fruit stand. Calling Palestinians ''an unforgiving people, full of vengeance,'' Mr. Navah said, ''I'll feel safe and secure when we start behaving toward them the same way they behave toward us.''"]

''I stood up and saw the terrorist. His head was cracked open, one leg was lying here, the other leg was lying over there. I just ran. I didn't even have time to say amen, and the ambulance picked me up.'' Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, said the attack underscored the need for the Palestinians to create ''a unified security apparatus that can be accountable and can deal with issues of terrorism.'' Speaking on the CNN program ''Late Edition,'' Ms. Rice said, ''People who do these sorts of things clearly do not want the Palestinian people to achieve their dream of a Palestinian state, because Israel is not going to be able to live with a Palestinian state in an atmosphere of terror.'' Mr. Arafat called last week for thorough reform of his Palestinian Authority, but he has yet to announce precise steps. He put off plans on Sunday to meet with the Palestinian election committee to advance the possibility of elections, citing a sudden visit by the Jordanian prime minister, Ali Abu Ragheb. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has demanded top-to-bottom changes in the Palestinian Authority before Israel will move forward with peace talks. The Bush administration has not adopted that condition but it has been pressing for change, particularly to the many overlapping security agencies."]
["world", "President Bush has said he will send George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, to the Middle East to assist in such security reform. But Ms. Rice said there were still no plans for Mr. Tenet's trip. Senior Israeli officials have resisted the visit, arguing that no meaningful changes could be made while Mr. Arafat was in charge. On the Israeli side, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called over the weekend for urgent international diplomacy to consolidate the Palestinian security forces and promptly form a Palestinian state on the territory already controlled by the Palestinian Authority. The two sides would then begin talks on a final agreement. Palestinian leaders have called this approach unacceptable, and it also conflicts with Mr. Sharon's stated views. From the treeless shores of the Dead Sea to the verdant north, Israelis returned to their favorite escapes over the long weekend that began Thursday with the holiday of Shavuot. One tourism official told the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot, in an article published on Sunday, ''Finally, the people of Israel have succeeded in finding some tranquillity.'' At a mineral spa on the Dead Sea, the director, Ovadia Rappaport, 42, said ''people are exploding out of their houses,'' believing that the Israeli operation had succeeded. Until this weekend, he said, the local tourist trade was reeling. ''What happened on Passover at Netanya killed us,'' he said. In 2000, there were 120,000 visitors to the spa, he said; in 2001, there were perhaps 20,000. But thousands visited over the weekend, he said."]

''Only my shoes remained intact,'' he said wryly, picking at a laceration on his right hand as he lay in a hospital. Mr. Chopenko's cellphone was in his shirt pocket, over his heart, when the bomb exploded. A nail had been embedded up to its head in the back of the phone, which was still working.

George W. Bush for president at its final meeting of the year on Saturday. The development makes it very unlikely that Mr. Bush will receive the group's formal approval before Election Day, N.R.A. officials said today. That does not mean, however, that the rifle association will sit out the election. Far from it: the  organization intends to spend millions of dollars supporting Mr. Bush and trying to discredit his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, as a threat to gun ownership. But officials of the association said today that they did not want to provide the Democrats new fodder for attacking Mr. Bush, and so had decided to withhold a formal endorsement. Polls suggest that the N.R.A., while popular in many Republican areas, is viewed negatively by large numbers of the independent suburban voters whom Mr. Bush is trying to court, particularly women. ''Our goal is to do no harm'' to Mr. Bush, one N.R.A. official said, noting that the group was already pouring money into the race to help the governor. Mr. Bush has had a good working relationship with the rifle association in Texas. But he has tried to maintain a polite distance from the group during the campaign, and aides said today that he had not sought the group's endorsement, or its neutrality."]

And Handgun Control Inc. has been running an advertisement in several swing states featuring a previously disclosed film clip of Kayne Robinson, an N.R.A. vice president, telling a friendly audience that if Mr. Bush is elected, ''we'll have a president where we work out of their office.'' Once averse to getting involved in politics, the 129-year-old rifle association did not begin endorsing presidential candidates until the 1980's. But since then, it has been solidly in the Republican camp, endorsing Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and George Bush in 1988. The group did not endorse President Bush in 1992 or Bob Dole in 1996, because of differences on some issues, but it spent millions of dollars attacking Bill Clinton. Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control, said he was not surprised that the rifle association had not endorsed Governor Bush, because ''they've become a real albatross for candidates,'' particularly among women. Mr. Sudbay added that the rifle association did not need to trumpet its support for Mr. Bush because it was already making clear to its four million members -- through speeches by its leaders, Web site postings and mailings -- that it wanted him elected. Indeed, officials of the rifle association said today that there would soon be a new round of mailings and, perhaps, television advertisements attacking Mr. Gore in several important swing states where gun ownership is high, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio."]

There is still some time for Lundqvist, though every biological clock ticks at a different pace. He is still sharp enough.

The puck glanced off his body into the net. The other goals were virtually unstoppable. The first was a deflection by Mike Hoffman off a hard Erik Karlsson shot. The killer score arrived just 2 minutes 21 seconds after the Rangers had closed the gap to 2-1 in the second period. On a bang-bang play over the length of the rink, Chris Kreider failed to thoroughly backcheck Karlsson, the wrong player to ignore. The Senators star took a pass from Bobby Ryan and fired the puck past Lundqvist from close range. The fourth goal was an empty netter, with Lundqvist on the bench. Nobody could blame him for that one. Still, just as Carey Price had failed to carry the Canadiens beyond the first round, Lundqvist hadn\u2019t quite mustered enough magic to rescue the Rangers.

But the Kenyan government has yet to release casualty figures. According to Western diplomats, at least 160 Kenyan soldiers were killed and 20 were captured, the single worst military defeat in Kenya\u2019s history. The Kenyan military maintains several bases throughout Somalia as part of a regional peacekeeping mission. Several military analysts said the Shabab video showed how poorly prepared the Kenyans were at that base. Kenyans on social media have deplored the video as propaganda and urged people not to watch it or share it. Little is known about the East African Front, which said it recognized Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, as the rightful leader of all Muslims. Mr. Bryden of Sahan Research said it was not clear how many fighters, if any, the East African Front has.

Drugs that once cost $12,000 a year fell to less than $100, and the world was willing to pay. In Uganda, where fewer than 10,000 were on drugs a decade ago, nearly 200,000 now are, largely as a result of American generosity. But the golden window is closing."]
["world/africa", "Uganda is the first country where major clinics routinely turn people away, but it will not be the last. In Kenya next door, grants to keep 200,000 on drugs will expire soon. An American-run program in Mozambique has been told to stop opening clinics. There have been drug shortages in Nigeria and Swaziland. Tanzania and Botswana are trimming treatment slots, according to a report by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. The collapse was set off by the global recession\u2019s effect on donors, and by a growing sense that more lives would be saved by fighting other, cheaper diseases. Even as the number of people infected by AIDS grows by a million a year, money for treatment has stopped growing. Other forces made failure almost inevitable. Science has produced no magic bullet \u2014 no cure, no vaccine, no widely accepted female condom. Every proposal for controlling the epidemic with current tools \u2014 like circumcising every man in the third world, giving a daily prophylactic pill to everyone contemplating sex or testing billions of people and treating all the estimated 33 million who would test positive \u2014 is wildly impractical.

Too few people, particularly in Africa, are using the \u201cABC\u201d approach pioneered here in Uganda: abstain, be faithful, use condoms.

(W.H.O. guidelines are conservative; if all 33 million were Americans, most clinicians would treat them at once.) Instead, despite a superhuman effort by donors, fewer than four million are on treatment. Just to meet the minimal W.H.O. guidelines, donations would have to treble instead of going flat. Uganda is a microcosm of that: 500,000 need treatment, 200,000 are getting it, but each year, an additional 110,000 are infected. \u201cYou cannot mop the floor when the tap is still running on it,\u201d said Dr. David Kihumuro Apuuli, director-general of the Uganda AIDS Commission. Some battles will still be won. Middle-income countries with limited epidemics, like India, Brazil and Russia, can probably treat all their patients without outside help. China almost certainly can. South Africa might; it has a raging epidemic but is rich by African standards. But for most of Africa and scattered other countries like Haiti, Guyana and Cambodia, it seems inevitable that the 1990s will return: walking skeletons in the villages, stacks of bodies in morgues, mountains of newly turned earth in cemeteries.

Kazatchkine, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said he had become \u201chugely frustrated.\u201d"]
["world/africa", "\u201cThe consistent answer I hear is: \u2018We love you, we hear you, we acknowledge the fund\u2019s good results, but our budget is tight, our budget is cut, it\u2019s the economic crisis.\u2019\u00a0\u201d No commander in the global fight openly concedes that the war is over, but all admit to deep pessimism. \u201cI don\u2019t see the cavalry riding to the rescue,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an AIDS researcher who leads one of the National Institutes of Health. \u201cI\u2019m worried we\u2019ll be in a \u2018Kampala situation\u2019 in other countries soon,\u201d said AmbassadorEric Goosby, the Obama administration\u2019s new global AIDS coordinator. \u201cWhat I see is making me very scared,\u201d agreed Michel Sidib\u00e9, executive director of Unaids. Without a change of heart among donors, Mr. Sidib\u00e9 said, \u201cthe whole hope I\u2019ve had for the last 10 years will disappear.\u201d Donors give about $10 billion a year, while controlling the epidemic would cost $27 billion a year, he estimated. His predecessor, Dr. Peter Piot, said he had seen optimism soar and then fade. Hopes rose from 2001 to 2003 when cheap generic antiretroviral drugs became available, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations formed the Global Fund and President George W. Bush initiated the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar. \u201cThen, we were at a tipping point in the right direction,\u201d Dr. Piot said. \u201cNow I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re at a tipping point in the wrong direction.\u201d"]
["world/africa", "AIDS2031, a panel he convened to look ahead to the epidemic\u2019s 50th anniversary, issued a pessimistic report in November that concluded: \u201cWithout a change in approach, a major epidemic will still be with us in 2031.\u201d Because of population growth, it said, there may still be two million new infections a year even then. According to the Uganda AIDS Commission, the lifetime bill for treating one Ugandan AIDS patient, counting drugs, tests and medical salaries, is $11,500. Donors have decided that is too much, that more lives can be saved by concentrating on child-killers like stillbirth, pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, measles and tetanus. Cures for those killers, like antibiotics, mosquito nets, rehydration salts, water filters, shots and deworming pills, cost $1 to $10. Under its new Global Health Initiative, the Obama administration has announced plans to shift its focus to mother-and-child health. The AIDS budget was increased by only 2 percent. The British government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also said they would focus support on mother-child health. \u201cThe political winds have changed,\u201d said Sharonann Lynch, chief author of the Doctors Without Borders report. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe for a minute it\u2019s just the economic downturn. I think world leaders feel the heat is off and they\u2019re fatigued.\u201d American taxpayers have been particularly generous to Uganda, paying for 88 percent of its drugs; Ugandans know it."]
["world/africa", "Karen Morgan, an American who runs a laboratory at the hospital where Ms. Kamukama was turned away, said: \u201cJust today, a patient came up to me in the parking lot and said, \u2018Thank you, American.\u2019 I said, \u2018For what?\u2019 He said \u2018For my medicine. You care if I live or die.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Nearby, in a tent on the hospital lawn, Moses Nsubuga, a D.J. known as Supercharger, rehearsed his troupe, the Stigmaless Band, composed entirely of teenagers on AIDS drugs.

One reminds him that he has been instructed to stop enrolling new patients and asks for an explanation of reports that he is treating 37,000 when only 32,000 are authorized. Another asks him not to announce publicly that his funds have been frozen.

["world/africa", "He has another reason. Family members like Ms. Kamukama and her cousin will often share one set of pills, an act of love that leads to disaster. Incomplete treatment means both will probably die, but may first develop drug-resistant AIDS and pass it on. American officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed the financing freeze. \u201cThe decision was made late in the Bush administration to cap Uganda at $280 million,\u201d one said. \u201cThat\u2019s an industrial amount of money.\u201d United States Embassy officials debated adding $38 million, he said, but cabinet-level Ugandan ministers had been caught stealing from other donors and, though forced to repay the money, were not jailed.  The government \u201chasn\u2019t shown the leadership or commitment to transparency to earn additional funds,\u201d the official added. Also, he said, Uganda contributes too little. Oil was recently discovered near Lake Albert and the government promised to spend the royalties on roads and electricity, but did not mention AIDS. \u201cAnd now the paper says they\u2019re buying Russian jets,\u201d another official added with obvious disgust. Uganda is negotiating for a $300 million squadron of Sukhoi fighter-bombers. For doctors on the front line, the frustration is palpable. Dr. Natasha Astill is a British AIDS specialist working at a hospital on the edges of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, in a mountain valley with pygmy settlements close by fancy gorilla-tourist lodges. It is so remote that the drugs that reached Kampala in 2003 did not get here until 2007."]

She can still give free antiretrovirals to a few; while her hospital\u2019s American funds are frozen, it still gets some drugs from the Ugandan Ministry of Health and cash gifts from wildlife tourists and the singer Elton John.

["health", "Elisabeth Bing Dies at 100; \u2018Mother of Lamaze\u2019 Helped Change Childbirth - The New York Times Elisabeth Bing, who helped lead a natural childbirth movement that revolutionized how babies were born in the United States, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100. Her death was confirmed by her son, Peter. Ms. Bing taught women and their spouses to make informed childbirth choices for more than 50 years. (\u201cWe don\u2019t call it natural childbirth, but educated childbirth,\u201d she once said.) She began her crusade at a time when hospital rooms were often cold and impersonal, women in labor were heavily sedated and men were expected to remain in the waiting room, pacing. Ms. Bing pushed for change. She worked directly with obstetricians, introducing them to the so-called natural childbirth methods developed by Dr. Fernand Lamaze, which incorporated relaxation techniques in lieu of anesthesia and enabled a mother to see her child coming into the world. Along with Marjorie Karmel, Ms. Bing helped found Lamaze International, a nonprofit educational organization. She became known as \u201cthe mother of Lamaze,\u201d championing the technique in her book \u201cSix Practical Lessons for an Easier Childbirth\u201d (1967) and on the lecture and television talk-show circuits. Today, Lamaze and other natural childbirth methods are commonplace in delivery rooms, and Lamaze classes, with their emphasis on breathing techniques, are attended by an estimated quarter of all mothers-to-be in the United States and their spouses each year."]
["health", "For years Ms. Bing led classes in hospitals and in a studio in her apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where she kept a collection of pre-Columbian and later Native American fertility figurines. Ms. Bing preferred the term \u201cprepared childbirth\u201d to \u201cnatural childbirth\u201d because, she said, her goal was not to eschew drugs altogether but to empower women to make informed decisions. Her mantra was \u201cAwake and alert,\u201d and she saw such a birth as a transformative event in a woman\u2019s life. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience that never leaves you,\u201d she told The New York Times in 2000. \u201cIt needs absolute concentration; it takes up your whole being. And you learn to use your body correctly in a situation of stress.\u201d There was one secret she seldom shared, however: Her own experience giving birth to her son, Peter, was decidedly unnatural. As Randi Hutter Epstein reported in her book \u201cGet Me Out: A History of Childbirth From the Garden of Eden to the Sperm Bank\u201d (2010), she continually asked her doctor, \u201cIs my baby all right? Is my baby all right,\u201d until the doctor said he could not concentrate with her chatter and gave her laughing gas and an epidural. \u201cI got everything I raged against,\u201d Ms. Bing told Ms. Epstein. \u201cI had the works.\u201d"]
["health", "Elisabeth Dorothea Koenigsberger was born in a suburb of Berlin on July 8, 1914. Her parents, of Jewish descent, had converted to Protestantism years before her birth, but the family nevertheless felt the virulent anti-Semitism sweeping Germany before World War II. She was kicked out of a university two days into her freshman year, and two of her brothers \u2014 a historian and an architect \u2014 could not find work because of their Jewish background, she told The Journal of Perinatal Education in 2000. After Ms. Bing\u2019s father died in 1932, the family left the country; most members settled in England, while one sister moved to Illinois. In London, Ms. Bing studied to become a physical therapist and began work at a hospital. Mostly she helped patients with paralysis, multiple sclerosis and broken bones, but every morning she also visited the maternity ward, to give massages to new mothers and help them exercise. At the time, women were not allowed out of bed for as many as 10 days after giving birth. She became interested in natural childbirth in 1942 when a patient handed her Dr. Grantly Dick-Read\u2019s influential book \u201cRevelation of Childbirth,\u201d published that year (and later titled \u201cChildbirth Without Fear\u201d). Dick-Read proposed that pain during childbirth was caused by fear, and that a woman could avoid anesthesia by following a series of relaxation techniques aimed at reducing that fear."]
["health", "Ms. Bing became intrigued and hoped to train with Dick-Read in the north of England, but with the war on and travel all but impossible, she began her own independent study. She read as much as she could and observed obstetricians and their patients \u2014 heavily anesthetized women who, she saw, had little control over the birth of their children. \u201cWhat I saw I disliked intensely,\u201d she said in her interview with the perinatal journal. \u201cI thought there must be better ways.\u201d Ms. Bing, who drove an ambulance during the war, began pursuing her interest in natural childbirth after 1949, when she moved to Jacksonville, Ill., to be with her sister, who had recently married. There, while working with handicapped children, Ms. Bing met an obstetrician who, she discovered, knew very little about natural childbirth. Resolving to champion the techniques, she began approaching obstetricians and having them send patients to her for one-on-one classes. Ms. Bing had planned to return to England in about a year and was on her way back when she stopped in New York to visit friends. There she met Fred Max Bing, an exporter\u2019s agent, and decided to stay. The two were married in 1951. Besides her son, Ms. Bing is survived by a granddaughter. Her husband died in 1984. In New York, Ms. Bing again started giving private childbirth education classes. They caught the attention of Dr. Alan Guttmacher, the chief of obstetrics at Mount Sinai Hospital, which had opened its first maternity ward in 1951. He asked her to teach a formal class there."]
["health", "In her search for other childbirth alternatives, Ms. Bing began to learn about the psychoprophylactic method developed in the mid-1950s by Lamaze, a French obstetrician. Lamaze refined Dick-Read\u2019s approach by incorporating breathing exercises he had observed in the Soviet Union, where anesthesia was a luxury poor women in labor could scarcely afford. In 1960, Ms. Bing, by then a clinical assistant professor at New York Medical College, and Ms. Karmel founded the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics, known today as Lamaze International. Ms. Karmel, an American, had become a natural-childbirth crusader after seeking out Lamaze in Paris to help her deliver her first child, and her best-selling book, \u201cThank You, Dr. Lamaze\u201d (1959), largely introduced the method to Americans and drew Ms. Bing\u2019s attention. (In the late 1950s, Ms. Bing had persuaded Ms. Karmel to smuggle into the United States an explicit French educational film, \u201cNaissance,\u201d depicting a woman giving natural birth. When New York City hospitals and the 92nd Street Y refused to show it in prenatal classes \u2014 they considered it obscene \u2014 the two women held a private screening at Ms. Karmel\u2019s home on the Upper East Side. Ms. Karmel died of breast cancer in 1964. At the heart of the methods the women promoted was the idea of family teamwork, with the father helping the mother by coaching her in responding to her contractions with breathing exercises and massaging her back, and being present during the delivery."]
["health", "But in her book, Ms. Bing cautioned, \u201cYou certainly must not feel any guilt or sense of failure if you require some medication, or if you experience discomfort or pain.\u201d Some obstetricians were skeptical of the methods and thought Ms. Bing, not being a physician, was ill qualified to be instructing patients. But the natural-childbirth movement found a receptive public. Women coming of age in the 1960s embraced the idea of taking a more active role in childbirth and wanted fathers to participate more as well. \u201cIt was a tremendous cultural revolution that changed obstetrics entirely,\u201d Ms. Bing said in an interview in 1988. Ms. Bing was modest about her role in the movement. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a movement by Lamaze or Read or me,\u201d she told the Disney-owned website Family.com. \u201cIt was a consumer movement. The time was ripe. The public doubted everything their parents had done.\u201d But she rejoiced in the outcome. \u201cWe are not being tied down anymore,\u201d she said in 2000. \u201cWe\u2019re not lying flat on our backs with our legs in the air, shaved like a baby. You can give birth in any position you like. The father, or anybody else, can be there. We fought for years on end for that. And now it\u2019s commonplace. We\u2019ve got it all.\u201d Lamaze, himself, did not acknowledge Ms. Bing, never responding to her requests for an interview even though she had made his name part of the American vernacular. During their only meeting, at a lunch in New York, he directed all his comments to a male obstetrician at the table."]
["health", "\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of myself as someone with a legacy of any kind,\u201d Ms. Bing said in an interview at an Upper West Side cafe. \u201cI hope I have made women aware that they have choices, they can get to know their body and trust their body.\u201d \u201cIf my ideas supported feminist ideas,\u201d she continued, \u201cwell, that\u2019s all right.

["us", "Backed by Law Enforcement, Undocumented Immigrant Gets Reprieve - The New York Times ST. LOUIS \u2014 Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco, whose small Illinois town rallied around him when he was arrested last month for being in this country without immigration papers, left a detention center here on Wednesday afternoon after posting a $3,000 bond. An immigration judge granted his release only hours before, during a hearing in Kansas City, Mo., noting that he had received a surprising array of supportive letters about Mr. Hernandez from leaders in West Frankfort, Ill., including the county prosecutor, deputy chief of police and a retired member of the Illinois State Police. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically see this kind of documentation,\u201d the immigration judge, Justin W. Howard, said, adding that he had given \u201cparticular weight\u201d to the backing from law enforcement officials. In a phone call late Wednesday, during a two-hour ride from the detention center to his home in West Frankfort, Mr. Hernandez said he was relieved, tired and grateful. The ride was in a vehicle lent by a West Frankfort car dealer. Donations had come in to help with the bond. \u201cI\u2019m amazed by the support I\u2019ve gotten \u2014 amazed,\u201d said Mr. Hernandez, 38, who is the longtime manager of La Fiesta, a restaurant in West Frankfort. Mr. Hernandez\u2019s case \u2014 and the way his Southern Illinois region, which voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump, rallied to his side \u2014 has drawn a flood of attention, particularly on social media."]
["us", "Some call him a symbol of the many undocumented immigrants who are threatened by the Trump administration\u2019s promised crackdown but who have contributed to their communities. Others have questioned the support from West Frankfort\u2019s mostly white residents, given their backing of Mr. Trump and the plight of a far larger universe of undocumented immigrants \u2014 beyond Mr. Hernandez. Still others say Mr. Hernandez, lauded for his charitable efforts and for taking part in civic groups in West Frankfort, broke the law and should be deported. Though he is out on bond, Mr. Hernandez faces the threat of deportation. Friends say that Mr. Hernandez entered the country from Mexico without permission in the 1990s, and that he applied for legal status but those efforts stalled somewhere along the way. Government lawyers, who opposed releasing him on bond on Wednesday, noted that he had two convictions for drunken driving in 2007. The government asked the judge to reserve its right to appeal the bond decision. \u201cMore than anything, I\u2019m nervous about how everything\u2019s going to play out,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. He appeared at his hearing in Kansas City by video conference from the St. Louis detention center. He said little and was asked few questions. He had been in custody since Feb. 9, when immigration agents arrested him near the restaurant. He gave his lawyer, Victor Arana, a thumbs up into the video camera upon hearing the news that he would be able to post a bond."]
["us", "Mr. Arana told the judge that he intended to pursue Mr. Hernandez\u2019s earlier efforts \u2014 apparently many years old \u2014 to gain legal status. Mr. Hernandez\u2019s wife got her citizenship late last year, and their three sons are citizens, the lawyer said. Mr. Hernandez declined to talk about the particulars of his case since it is still open. But he said he was not upset that residents in his region had largely supported Mr. Trump despite his hard stance on immigration. Most people in town, he said, probably did not know that he was undocumented. Besides, he said, \u201cin this case, I don\u2019t think it was much about immigration. It was more about energy. It is a coal miner town.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually happy that they exercise their right to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what democracy should be.\u201d"]
["automobiles", "Navigation Systems Still Show the Way, but Also Make the Route Safer - The New York Times WHEN Gary Kaye, an editor and former television producer in Connecticut, bought his 2005 Volvo XC90, it had an in-dash navigation system. But he says the company wanted \u201can astonishing amount of money\u201d to update the maps every year. Eventually, Mr. Kaye stopped using the car\u2019s navigation in favor of free apps like Google\u2019s Waze on his smartphone. When he bought a 2012 Audi A5, he didn\u2019t even bother asking for the built-in navigation system. Under siege by free mapping and crowdsourced apps from the likes of Google and Apple \u2014 and apps like Android Auto and CarPlay \u2014 in-car navigation systems seemed destined to go the way of video stores. But rather than fading into the sunset of disrupted technologies, dedicated navigation may be headed for a bright new e-horizon. E-horizon, or electronic horizon, is the term auto and navigation companies use to describe maps that go far beyond basic directions and two-dimensional cartography to include information like weather conditions, congestion, traffic signal positions, elevation, road curvature and even the presence of black ice ahead. \u201cNavigation is the longest range sensor in the vehicle,\u201d said Philip Ventimiglia, a product manager at Bosch, which is working with TomTom on a new generation of maps. \u201cRadar and cameras can only see 200 meters ahead; navigation systems can look kilometers ahead.\u201d"]
["automobiles", "These expanded maps, sometimes referred as 3-D maps, will not only provide drivers with more detailed information about what\u2019s down the road, but also become one of the primary technologies that enables advanced driver assistance and autonomous vehicle systems. It\u2019s why a consortium of automakers \u2014 Audi, BMW and Daimler \u2014 recently completed the $2.8 billion purchase of Nokia\u2019s HERE mapping business. The car companies underscored the need for more precise maps and navigation systems integrated with car controls. \u201cThe critical thing is how much more the nav system is going to get integrated into the advanced driver assistance systems of a car,\u201d said Ogi Redzic, a senior vice president at HERE. With road geometry information, for example, a car\u2019s navigation system might automatically apply the brakes and electronic stability control systems when it senses a driver is approaching a curve too quickly. Already on the road is a navigation system with topographic information that can control the transmission in the 2015 Rolls-Royce Wraith. On a recent test drive in the mountains of Vermont, the Wraith anticipated steep ascents, seamlessly switching gears and adjusting torque on its own to maintain a constant speed uphill. Gerry Spahn, Rolls-Royce\u2019s head of communications in North America, said the goal of the system was simply to produce a smoother ride, but the same kind of technology was being applied by Bosch in trucks in Europe to save fuel."]
["automobiles", "Many of the new systems like the Rolls-Royce satellite-assisted transmission will intervene without driver input. The 2016 BMW 7 Series sedans, for example, can automatically slow and accelerate to match posted speed limits. But convincing car buyers to pay for such technology may be a challenge. When Mark Lipson, a government employee in Ottawa, recently bought a 2016 Hyundai Elantra, he eschewed the navigation option. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy the built-in nav because the package was more expensive than what I wanted to pay,\u201d he said. Automakers promise that such navigation features in advanced driver assistance systems will come to mass-market vehicles, eventually as standard equipment. The e-horizon systems also will not be supplanted by smartphone apps, they say. Smartphones cannot collect precise data about the position of, say, lane markings or gradients and are unable to control critical braking and steering systems. \u201cAs cars become more autonomous,\u201d says Phil Eyler, president of the connected car division at Harman, \u201cthe need to have embedded navigation is going to be a critical part of the car to ensure safety and high-precision accuracy.\u201d To see the e-horizon future, one can look to autonomous car programs underway at companies like Google and Ford. Google\u2019s vehicles in California and Texas cram into maps features like the precise position of traffic lights and curb heights, which cannot be collected by the company\u2019s popular crowdsourced Waze traffic app. At Ford, using radar, lidar and video cameras the automaker has created 3-D maps of a University of Michigan test facility where the company is experimenting with self-driving cars."]
["automobiles", "\u201cThe maps are a baseline,\u201d said Greg Stevens, global manager of Ford\u2019s driver assistance and active safety research. \u201cYou need to know where the lanes are and what rules apply to those lanes.\u201d Mr. Stevens added that considerable research was still needed to determine exactly how much additional information would be required to create the ultimate e-horizon. \u201cKnowing precisely where fire hydrants are, for example, could be useful if the car is trying to tell whether or not it\u2019s a child standing on the side of the road.\u201d Navigation systems will also have to be tied into a car\u2019s array of sensors and computer control modules. At TomTom, a spokesman, Frans de Rooij, said it meant relying on data captured by the company\u2019s dedicated mapping vehicles and also supplementing it with real-time information from car sensors, like video cameras that recognize speed limit changes because of new construction. To alert drivers of heavy weather ahead, navigation systems will require weather forecasts and access to windshield wiper activity in other cars. Braking systems can presage an accident around a corner; headlight activations may indicate there\u2019s fog on the highway. The goal is to make driving safer, preventing accidents and along the way saving fuel and reducing emissions. When Mr. Lipson, who recently rejected the navigation option in his new Hyundai, was asked about a system that could slow down a car long before a driver sees a traffic problem ahead, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s something I would definitely be interested in.\u201d"]
["travel", "BRAINS, PLANES AND AUTOMOBILES; Toward a Smoother Flight - The New York Times IT'S your vacation, and every millisecond is precious. How much of it do you want to spend in transit? Few people planning to travel by air this summer are likely to have forgotten the televised scenes from last year, when bad weather and labor unrest resulted in flight delays that broke records. The nightmare stories prompted Congress to consider several versions of an air passengers' bill of rights, but these efforts also seem to be delayed at the gate. The coming travel season shows every sign of being as bad, if not worse. So while Allan Sherman used to sing that ''good advice costs nothing, and it's worth the price,'' it may be wise to consider the tips frequent fliers use, and engage in what the Department of Transportation creatively describes as ''defensive flying.'' Risk: Labor Unrest The most ominous situation for summer air travelers is a threat on the ground: two of the largest United States airlines -- United and American -- face possible strikes. The last time there was such an alignment of labor unrest was in 1966, when machinists from five major airlines went on strike simultaneously, prompting President Lyndon B. Johnson to intervene. Now there are more than six times as many people flying, and both labor and management are aware of the power of a job action. As Clay Foushee, the vice president of regulatory affairs at Northwest Airlines (which just settled with its mechanics' and cleaners' union), put it, ''The employee group can shut you down.''"]
["travel", "Even without a strike, labor unrest can affect travelers if employees engage in work slowdowns or job actions. The normal advice -- avoid booking flights on airlines with labor disputes -- won't be easy to follow: these two airlines carry a third of all air travelers in  the United States. ''There are only a small number of airlines where travelers can go to seek shelter,'' says David S. Stempler, the president of the Air Travelers Association, an air passenger group in Washington. ''And those airlines don't have enough capacity to offer a safe harbor.'' Of course, users of frequent-flier miles are out of luck in a strike. So it makes sense to pay close attention to news reports about union negotiations and make ticket-buying decisions accordingly. Updates on the labor situation can be found on the Internet at airlinebiz.com/wire /labor. If you have already bought a ticket on Northwest, United or American, do a little research before you travel to find out what other airlines fly to your destination. Then call and find out the policy on accepting a striking airlines' tickets. Alternative flight information can be found on the online reservations systems of most major airlines by entering departure and destination information and selecting ''show all airlines.'' (For the New York area, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has an extensive listing of flights at www.panynj.gov/aviation /oagframe.HTM. )"]
["travel", "If you absolutely have to be somewhere at a certain time, and are willing to pay for the assurance, back up your ticket with a fully refundable ticket on another carrier. If your original flight goes off without a hitch, you can get your money back on the second ticket. Tip: Stay Flexible I can be absent-minded -- I once reserved a car service to take my family home from the airport after a vacation, forgetting our minivan was in long-term parking -- so when airlines began offering electronic ticketing, I was delighted. No more forgetting where I put my ticket, at least. But there is a price for such a convenience. When a flight is canceled, the defensive traveler with a paper ticket can call the toll-free number of another airline and reserve a seat on its next flight or go to its boarding gate and present the paper ticket to the gate agent, and if there is room get on that flight.  Sure, travelers with e-tickets can do the same thing, but they must first convert their ticket to a flight coupon, which means getting in line and waiting with everyone else. By then, people with paper tickets could have filled up the seats on the other carrier or the plane could have left. Airlines have saved millions of dollars in paper and postage since the introduction of the e-ticket. They won't like it if passengers start to reject them. Some airlines have begun to charge a $10 fee for a paper ticket.  Dean Headley, the author of the annual Airline Quality Rating report, thinks the fee is a worthwhile investment."]
["travel", "''With an e-ticket, the issuing company has you locked in,'' he said. ''A paper ticket is a piece of flexibility you can maintain for yourself.'' Risk: Airport Delays More than 450,000 flights were delayed at least 15 minutes last year, a 20 percent increase from 1999, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. If past is prologue, delays will be the biggest inconvenience this summer, too. The airline industry's hub-and-spoke system plays a significant role. Unless you're flying from one major city to another, and only a quarter of travelers do, air travel involves collecting passengers from scattered airports and routing them to one of two dozen major hubs, then on to their final destination. It makes economic sense for the airlines, but it creates a house of cards at the airports. To make it work, arrivals and departures at the hubs must be closely timed, putting pressure on everyone involved, from the crews who clean and service the airplanes to the luggage handlers who load and unload them to pilots and air traffic controllers who must pack all those planes onto the same amount of concrete. With a process so delicately balanced, a single deviation -- and there can be many in a business as complex as commercial aviation -- quickly cascades, creating problems that can affect an entire day and even an entire airport. Tips: Fly Early in the Day"]
["travel", "If yours is the first flight out in the morning, the plane and the crew have often spent the night in town. Even problems like weather and unexpected aircraft repairs are better dealt with when everyone is fresh. As the day wears on, molehills become mountains of trouble. And those friendly airline workers who helped board the breakfast flight can be impatient and irritable by dinnertime. FLY AT OFF HOURS -- If the first flight of the day doesn't work for you, schedule your trip  during the daily lulls. Reservation agents can steer you to the off-peak flights. Soon there may be a financial incentive as well:  to reduce bottlenecks, the government is encouraging airports to increase landing fees at peak hours. Risk: Airport Overload Some of the most notoriously delay-ridden airports -- La Guardia (responsible for nearly a third of all flight delays last year),  O'Hare and Logan, in Boston -- were built many years ago, when air traffic was a fraction of what it is today. ''It's just like the highway,'' said Mr. Foushee of Northwest. ''The concrete can only handle so many vehicles.'' But few communities are eager to add runways to existing airports. Only six new runways have been added to major airports in the last 20 years. There are alternatives to the most congested airports. San Francisco's famous fog helped the airport earn its rank as the fifth most delay-plagued airport in the country. Across the bay, the skies are usually clear at Oakland International."]
["travel", "In Boston, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which oversees Logan Airport, began a campaign to encourage travelers to fly from one of the six other New England airports. The airports in Manchester, N.H., and Warwick, R.I. (T. F. Green Airport), are only a little more than an hour's drive from downtown Boston. ''People associate the term 'reliever airport' or 'secondary airport' with secondary service,'' said Virginia Buckingham, the authority's executive director, ''but that's clearly not the case. Once they break the habit of coming through a major airport and experience the ease of driving in -- parking is cheaper, it's more comfortable because the terminals are less crowded -- they find out what a positive experience it is.'' Tip: Avoid Busy Airports Consider selecting less congested airports for both ends of your trip, and, if you have a choice, what hub to go through. Many major cities are served by more than one airport in  cities or large towns nearby. In Miami it's Fort Lauderdale; in New York there are Westchester County Airport, MacArthur Airport in Islip on Long Island and Stewart Airport in Newburgh, N.Y. Information about alternatives in New England is available at www.flynewengland.com. Risk: Denied Boarding ''On the planet Earth there is no airline that does not overbook,'' said Ed Stewart, director of public relations for Southwest Airlines. ''Or else they'd be out of business.''"]
["travel", "The peculiar economics of the airline industry seem to require some amount of overbooking. Ensuring that a plane takes off at least 65 percent full -- roughly the break-even point -- seems to require selling seats that on the day of travel might already have someone in them. On routes with a high no-show rate, an airline may sell twice as many tickets as it has seats. Sometimes, more passengers than expected show up for the flight. If the airline can't persuade enough of them to take a later plane, someone is going to get bumped. Airlines are required to pay up if they can't get bumped travelers to their destination within two hours of the original arrival time, so some folks are happy to take a later flight and pocket the money or a voucher for free travel in the future. But not all vacation travelers will cheerfully see their plans changed without their consent. To those folks, a warning: when it comes to selecting which passengers will be removed from a flight involuntarily, a number of airlines start with the passengers who paid the least. ''People are astounded by that,'' said Mr. Stempler of the Air Travelers Association,  ''but think about it. Full-fare passengers constitute 15 percent of the people on the plane. They're paying full-fare coach, but the airlines don't give them an improved product. What they get is protection against being bumped.''"]
["travel", "Smart travelers build a cushion of time into their trips when flying on discounted tickets, flying in a day or a half a day before they absolutely must be there. ''If you build flexibility into your schedule and you are denied boarding, it can be turned into a benefit,'' Mr. Headley of the Air Quality Rating report said. ''You can miss one flight and get a voucher to boot, and it doesn't hurt your attitude any.'' Students and others on tight travel budgets have been known to schedule themselves on flights that are regularly overbooked.  Airline reservations agents can check to see how full a flight is and will supply this information if asked. Flights in and out of popular vacation destinations like Las Vegas, San Juan and Orlando are known for offering opportunities for being bumped. Tip: Follow the Rules If you don't want to be bumped, first comply with the boarding requirements of your airline, which can be found on the back of the ticket, or with the e-mail or fax confirming an electronic ticket. Your seat can be canceled, even if you've paid for it, if you do not check in 15 minutes before flight time. ''The time you are at the gate is the important time,'' Mr. Stempler said. ''That way, you're among the shows instead of the no-shows.'' And by the way, loyalty pays. Most airlines protect their frequent fliers from bumping. Risk: Lost Luggage"]
["travel", "It doesn't happen that often, but mishandled luggage is the third most common complaint of air travelers. Business travelers are notorious for trying to stow all their belongings in the overhead bins; for vacationers toting things like golf clubs and portable playpens, this isn't an option. Air travelers sometimes add to their problems by showing up late for a flight or failing to put identification on suitcases.  Occasionally, a bag goes astray when another traveler walks off with it by mistake. The now famous videotape of Northwest Airlines baggage handlers playing basketball with suitcases and packages in Minneapolis last Christmas should be sufficient proof that suitcases may not receive proper respect. Airlines constantly warn travelers not to pack irreplaceable, fragile, valuable or critical items like medication in checked luggage. Furthermore, if checked luggage is damaged or the contents are lost, the airline will not necessarily compensate what you think you're due. On domestic flights, airlines accept a maximum liability of $2,500 for lost luggage, but that's not a given. ''It's adjusted, like any other claim would be,'' said Emmet Schwartzman, an aviation lawyer with Carlton Fields, a Florida firm that represents airlines. ''You've got to itemize what it is you claim you lost. If you can document it, that helps your case.'' Airlines will not pay for those valuable, breakable or electronic items it warned you not to pack, even if you've carried them on. Tips: Don't Push It"]
["travel", "Checking in for a flight with minutes to spare requires hustle on the part of the airline. And while you may be willing to make an undignified dash through the terminal to catch your plane, not every airline bag handler will feel motivated to join you. LABELS, INSIDE AND OUT -- Identification tags can come off. A second card with your name, home and destination information placed inside an unlocked compartment of your suitcase will help the airline reunite you with your bags if they get lost. DOUBLE-CHECK THE CLAIM TICKET -- Before handing over your luggage, make sure the correct destination tag is on each piece. Check again when picking up the luggage on arrival: many suitcases really do look alike.  A bright ribbon or a luggage tag attached to the handle will distinguish your bag from the dozen other black Samsonites on the carousel. Commercial aviation in the United States is overtaxed under the best of circumstances, and summer vacation travel makes it worse. No matter how many precautions you take, you may find your trip disrupted. Which leads to the final tip: Behave yourself. You may be traveling with children, but don't act like one yourself. If your flight plans are disrupted, it is unlikely to be the fault of one airport or airline worker. Like most people, the workers appreciate patience and respect. ''If you want to mistreat our employees, fly another airline,'' said Mr. Stewart of Southwest Airlines. ''The customer is not always right.''"]
["travel", "Since airline employees have a great deal of discretionary control over how passengers will be accommodated, being well mannered and polite is the best defensive flying technique of all."]
["booming", "The Clone Named Dolly - The New York Times This week\u2019s Retro Report video tells the story of Dolly the sheep, the first clone of an adult mammal. The Scottish scientists who created her recall the painstaking process of trying to get the experiment to work. After hundreds of tries, they successfully took a cell from an adult sheep, fused it to another sheep\u2019s unfertilized egg and implanted the resulting embryo in a surrogate mother. But Dolly\u2019s birth, and the rush of media attention that followed when the news broke in 1997, gave way almost instantaneously to fears and speculation about what this discovery meant for humanity\u2019s ability to manipulate biology. The debate only intensified in 1998, when an American scientist isolated human embryonic stem cells, which can develop into any type of cell in the body, raising the hope of a new field of regenerative medicine. Here, one of the science reporters who covered the debate for The Times offers a rearview commentary. Some events are just too emotive to be seen clearly until long after the dust has settled. The cloning of Dolly the sheep created a public ruckus because of the assumption that sheep clones would lead straight to human clones. The generation of human embryonic stem cells raised much the same set of fears. Both cases stirred deep anxieties that science was getting out of hand and moving deep into ethically fraught territory."]
["booming", "But in terms of the march of science, both events were of distinctly second-order magnitude, a fact almost impossible to convey at the time. The difficult step in animal cloning had in fact been taken many years before, in the cloning of frogs, and when the Nobel Prize jurors got around to recognizing the field, they gave their award to John Gurdon, frog cloner, not to Ian Wilmut, the so-called father of Dolly. In a similar vein, the discoverer of embryonic stem cells was Martin Evans, an English biologist who developed the technique in mice in 1981. The world only started paying attention to stem cells in 1998 when James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin applied Dr. Evans\u2019s recipe to people, but the Nobel Prize went to Dr. Evans. Journalists are sometimes said to write the first draft of history. But it\u2019s hard to write history about events that are being driven by emotion. In the debate over human embryonic stem cells, the opponents were concerned that federal funding for the research, in which castoff, early-stage human embryos are destroyed, would be the first step toward federal funding of abortion. Partly in reaction, some proponents of embryonic stem cell research vastly overpromised the probable medical treatments, which, 32 years after Dr. Evans\u2019s experiment and 15 years after Dr. Thomson\u2019s, are barely visible. (Clinical trials for a treatment for macular degeneration are proceeding, but a much-heralded one for spinal cord injury was abandoned in 2011.)"]
["booming", "Basic scientific research is enormously risky. If it weren\u2019t, the government wouldn\u2019t have to finance it. Most research ideas end up as dry holes. It\u2019s fine for the federal government to take such a risk, because it can afford to support 100 such projects, of which the one winner will make up for all the dogs. Yet in the frenzy of claims about the miraculous medical cures that President George W. Bush was seen as obstructing, voters in California in 2004 placed a $3 billion bet on stem cell research \u2014 a lot of risk for a single state to bear. The frustration of reporting events like Dolly and stem cells is that it\u2019s almost impossible to get such longer-term considerations into a daily news story, which typically focuses on a tiny piece of a large and complex puzzle. The charged issue of human stem cell origins was eventually sidestepped by technology. In 2006 a Japanese biologist, Shinya Yamanaka, cleverly guessed the identity of the four transcription factors responsible for the stemness of stem cells. When these are injected into an adult cell, they make it revert to the egglike status from which it was once derived. Little or no need, anymore, to mess with the castoff embryos from fertility clinics."]
["booming", "The future of stem cell research almost certainly lies with the Yamanaka method, which can use the patient\u2019s own cells and dodge any problem of immune incompatibility. But most schemes for therapeutic use still depend implicitly on the idea that stem cells can be converted into the right cell type in the test tube and then dropped into the body as well-behaved replacement cells. It\u2019s far from certain that this will always be the case. No test tube treatment can exactly replicate the experience of a cell in a growing embryo as it is exposed to a complex sequence of signals from a constantly changing cast of neighboring cells. In retrospect, Dolly the clone was just a sheep, not the start of a great moral collapse. Embryonic stem cells, despite the furor, may turn out to be a technical dead end. But reporters cannot stand aside from the waves of emotion that drive such issues. They just have to do the best they can with their first draft, and hope it doesn\u2019t look too ridiculous in the cold light of history. This week\u2019s Retro Report is the 15th in a documentary series. The video project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck. Retro Report has a staff of 13 journalists and 10 contributors led by Kyra Darnton, a former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer.

["sports/baseball", "Fixated on Every Pitch, Victor Martinez Helps the Tigers Stay Focused - The New York Times DETROIT \u2014 Victor Martinez was not on base to score the winning run Thursday when shadows crept over the right-field fence at Comerica Park. Martinez was removed for a pinch-runner after doubling through the infield shift to start the bottom of the ninth. A backup catcher, Bryan Holaday, crossed the plate to end the Detroit Tigers\u2019 3-2 victory over the Yankees. The Tigers\u2019 manager, Brad Ausmus, deemed Holaday a better use of legs than Martinez. Ausmus is a former catcher, like Martinez, who has squatted behind the plate only five times since tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament in a workout before the 2012 season. Martinez missed that fall\u2019s run to the World Series, the closest the Tigers have come lately to an elusive championship. Now a designated hitter, Martinez turns 36 this winter, when he will be a free agent. He looked pained when someone mentioned the possibility of playing to age 40. His son is already 10 years old, Martinez said, and growing up fast. It was better, he seemed to suggest, to live in the moment \u2014 an important one for his team and a splendid one for himself. The Tigers held a seven-game edge in the American League Central on July 24, a week before they traded for their latest ace starter, David Price. They are 14-13 since the deal, and the Kansas City Royals have surged ahead in the division. The Royals had won 21 of their last 27 games before hosting the Minnesota Twins on Thursday night."]
["sports/baseball", "\u201cObviously Kansas City\u2019s played the greatest baseball in the world,\u201d said Joba Chamberlain, a Tigers reliever. \u201cThey\u2019ve had bounces go their way, and they\u2019ve been playing great baseball; you can\u2019t get around it. But you can\u2019t worry about what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve got to continue to focus on what we can control, and this was a big win for us.\u201d It could have been a crushing loss, if Brian McCann\u2019s deep drive in the ninth had curled around the foul pole instead of hooking away from it. The big story then would have been the Tigers\u2019 shaky bullpen, or a hitless day from Miguel Cabrera, who waved at a curve from Dellin Betances to strike out with a runner on second in the eighth. Cabrera is hitting .304, but his slugging percentage, .496, is his lowest in a full season. With a win, though, the Tigers could pack for a road trip feeling upbeat. It was their fourth victory in five games, and Ausmus spoke hopefully of a momentum shift. He also gave Martinez an extraordinary compliment. Ausmus, who played 18 seasons in the majors, was teammates with Tony Gwynn in San Diego and with Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio in Houston. But Martinez, he said, stood apart from those star hitters in his concentration at the plate. \u201cHe\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen in my career, just on an everyday, every-pitch, every-at-bat basis,\u201d Ausmus said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he gets a hit every time, but he\u2019s been phenomenal. His focus on every single pitch, regardless of the score, regardless of the pitcher \u2014 his focus is unparalleled.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "Ausmus explained that Martinez\u2019s approach allowed him to take advantage of his supreme bat control. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing at getting the barrel of the bat to the ball, whether it\u2019s neck high or shoelace high,\u201d Ausmus said. \u201cAnd, secondly, he can foul off pitches like no one I\u2019ve ever seen before. Because he can reach so many pitches with his bat, he can extend at-bats unlike any other hitter I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Leading off the bottom of the ninth against Shawn Kelley, Martinez took two pitches to bring the count to 1-1. He fouled off three of the next four before his pivotal double, which set up Alex Avila\u2019s game-winning single off the wall with two outs. \u201cThe only thing I make sure of is, every time I step into the box, I just try to be a tough out,\u201d Martinez said. According to FanGraphs, Martinez had made contact on 91.5 percent of his swings before Thursday, covering foul balls and those in play. It was the highest percentage in the A.L. and trailed only two National Leaguers \u2014 Denard Span and Ben Revere, who are both singles hitters. Martinez has 26 home runs. \u201cHe never takes a pitch off,\u201d said Nick Castellanos, the Tigers\u2019 rookie third baseman. \u201cHis level of concentration is ridiculous.\u201d Martinez has fanned only 38 times this season, or once every 13.6 plate appearances, the best ratio among qualified hitters in the majors.

At 72-60, they are tied with the Seattle Mariners for the A.L.\u2019s second wild card. The Tigers and their fans expect more, but a veteran clubhouse is unlikely to panic.

A report released this week by IHS Automotive, an automotive industry analysis company, found that S.U.V.s and crossovers have unseated the sedan as America\u2019s vehicle of choice. According to the IHS report, which draws from retail new vehicle registration data from Polk, 36.5 percent of the new vehicle registrations in 2014 were S.U.V.s or crossovers, compared with 35.4 percent for sedans. IHS says this is the first time any body style has surpassed the sedan. Polk data showed that from 2010-13 sedans still topped new car registrations, at about 36 percent, compared with about 33 to 34 percent for S.U.V.s and crossovers. Pickup trucks accounted for 13.1 percent of registrations in 2014, compared with 13.6 in 2013. Perhaps predictably in the largely anti-station wagon American culture, only 1.2 percent of new car registrations went to station wagons, just ahead of convertibles, at 1 percent. Hatchback registrations declined by half a percentage point, with a 5.5 percent share in 2014, and the van segment was unchanged year over year at 3.6 percent, but down from 5 percent in 2009."]

A number of smaller crossovers, including the all-new Jeep Cherokee and the Nissan Rogue, have attracted customers with their high ground clearance and utilitarian layout, IHS noted."]
["arts/design", "Female Architects on the Significance of Zaha Hadid - The New York Times The death of Zaha Hadid at 65 on Thursday has reverberated through quarters of the architecture world from Baghdad, where she was born, to New York, London and Guangzhou, China, where she built. But the sense of loss, mounting online, has been most pronounced among female architects, who saw Ms. Hadid as a rare beacon of hope for their own success in a male-dominated field and a barometer of its continuing sexism. \u201cAs a female architect, I am in shock and distressed that another brilliant creative mind has passed away, especially a woman on par with the best male architects in the world,\u201d Gisela Schmidt, an architect in Atlanta, wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe was a strong woman in a profession that\u201d silences them, she added. \u201cWhat a loss for us!\u201d In The Guardian, Eva Jiricna, a former president of the Architectural Association in London and a close friend of Ms. Hadid\u2019s, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any man could actually compete with her. If we can eliminate the practice of talking about female architects, it would be the greatest tribute we could give her.\u201d She added that even after advances for women in recent years, it remained more difficult for a woman than for a man to get a job in architecture and to be paid the same. \u201cA client of ours said to me he didn\u2019t want any of my female colleagues to work on his project,\u201d Ms. Jiricna said. \u201cIt was completely incomprehensible.\u201d"]
["arts/design", "Abdullah Mahmoud, a young architect in Damascus, Syria, who posted a tribute to Ms. Hadid on Facebook, said that in his classes at Damascus University, from which he graduated last year, about 70 percent of the students were women \u2014 an indicator of how the profession\u2019s balance is shifting \u2014 and that Ms. Hadid\u2019s influence was hard to overstate. \u201cFor young architects here, especially the female ones, she was like a great princess,\u201d Mr. Mahmoud said in a telephone interview from Damascus. \u201cFor us, it was like: If Zaha Hadid could go to London and be a great architect and build for the Olympics and in China and everywhere, then why can\u2019t we do that? And that was very strong for the women I studied with.\u201d Ms. Hadid was the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize, architecture\u2019s top honor, in 2004, a quarter-century after the prize\u2019s founding. Since that milepost, the percentage of women architects in the United States has barely grown, increasing to 25.7 percent from 24 percent, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The architect Richard Meier recalled how several architects used to gather casually for dinner at the Century Club in New York, including Philip Johnson, Michael Graves and Peter Eisenman. \u201cZaha was the first woman, as far as I can remember, to attend one,\u201d Mr. Meier said. \u201cShe had a sense of herself that she could fit in wherever she wanted. She knew that what she did was highly respected.\u201d"]
["arts/design", "Initially, Ms. Hadid seemed to resist the idea of serving as a role model because of her gender. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman architect who never wanted to be called a woman architect \u2014 she was just an architect and one of the best ones,\u201d said Amale Andraos, the dean of Columbia University\u2019s architecture school. \u201cBut clearly she broke new ground by being a woman, by not being Western, by being educated all over the world \u2014 there is so much she enabled.\u201d Over time, Ms. Hadid came to recognize her importance as a symbol. In the book \u201cWhere Are the Women Architects?,\u201d to be published this month by Princeton University Press, Despina Stratigakos, the interim chairwoman of the University at Buffalo\u2019s architecture department, recounts Ms. Hadid\u2019s comments after winning the Architects\u2019 Journal\u2019s inaugural Jane Drew Prize for \u201cher outstanding contribution to the status of women in architecture\u201d in 2012. \u201cI used to not like being called a woman architect: I\u2019m an architect, not just a woman architect,\u201d Ms. Hadid said after winning the award, in an interview with CNN. \u201cGuys used to tap me on the head and say, \u2018You are O.K. for a girl.\u2019 But I see the incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it could be done, so I don\u2019t mind that at all.\u201d Despite her efforts over the years to be judged on the merits of her work, the news media often included discussion of her physical appearance or manner, rather than her professional performance."]

Or Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison appraised for her hairstyle? In receiving the Pritzker, Hadid joins those noble ranks and deserves better. Architecture deserves better.\u201d Nevertheless, over the years, Ms. Hadid continued to be criticized for headstrong behavior that her friends say would have gone unnoticed in a man. \u201cEverybody knows her as a diva and as a tough woman,\u201d the architect Thom Mayne said. \u201cShe\u2019s tough because she\u2019s in a profession that takes toughness to get through it. She has this great sense of humor and is actually a very motherly, caring person. Funny, incredibly loyal. She was a sweetheart. And it\u2019s not the part that most of the world sees.\u201d Tegan Bukowski, a former student of Ms. Hadid\u2019s at the Yale School of Architecture, who now works in the London office of Ms. Hadid\u2019s practice, said the office was rare in the profession, not only because it was nearly equally split between men and women. \u201cZaha herself was a role model, but she also created role models in the company by making sure that women thrived,\u201d Ms. Bukowski said. \u201cShe never held down men at all, but it was just about your work and your talent. It never felt like gender was an issue. Because she basically just leveled the playing field in a way that I\u2019ve never seen in any other practice before.

["sports/basketball", "Amar\u2019e Stoudemire and Knicks Said to Be Parting Ways With Contract Buyout - The New York Times The Knicks have agreed to buy out the remainder of forward Amar\u2019e Stoudemire\u2019s contract, freeing him to join another club before the N.B.A. resumes its schedule this week, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Stoudemire and the Knicks will make a formal announcement about the agreement on Monday, the person said. The Daily News first reported the deal on Sunday night during the All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden. Stoudemire is in the final season of the five-year, $100 million contract he signed with the Knicks in 2010, when he joined the team as a free agent. He was due to make $23.4 million salary this season. Stoudemire had an excellent first season with the Knicks, averaging 25.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in 78 games. But injuries reduced his effectiveness in the following seasons. This season, Stoudemire missed 17 games with the struggling Knicks before the All-Star Game while battling a variety of ailments, including a sore right knee. He was averaging 12.0 points and 6.8 rebounds. News about the deal was filtering around the Garden after the All-Star Game, including to Carmelo Anthony, who said Stoudemire\u2019s presence on the Knicks was one of the main reasons Anthony was comfortable joining the team in a trade in 2011. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Anthony, who was informed of the move after playing in the game. \u201cI thought they were lying.\u201d"]
["sports/basketball", "Anthony added, \u201cAmar\u2019e brought something back to New York that New York had been missing for a long time.\u201d Anthony said he would not call Stoudemire on Sunday night but wished him well. \u201cHe wants to play for a contender, so I don\u2019t think anyone should hold that back from him,\u201d Anthony said. SILVER HAS GOAL FOR LOTTERY  Fans of the Knicks may be tallying all the losses this season as they dream of landing Duke\u2019s Jahlil Okafor, the prize of this year\u2019s draft, but the draft lottery, in its 31st season, will make that more difficult than most realize. And in the coming months, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has promised to make losing even less attractive to teams. Speaking before the All-Star weekend\u2019s Saturday night events in Brooklyn, Silver insisted that the system worked as is, but he acknowledged a widespread perception that it did not. In an interesting concession, he said one of the goals of his second year as commissioner would be to reassure fans by adjusting the system to more clearly show that there was little incentive to lose games. \u201cI don\u2019t think the system is as broken as some may suggest,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require a tweak.\u201d"]
["sports/basketball", "Okafor, a 6-foot-11 freshman center, is the type of player who can turn a struggling team around in a hurry, but there is no guarantee that the Knicks will get the chance to draft him. Unlike the N.F.L., which automatically gives the worst team the top pick, the N.B.A. has a system that gives the team with the worst record just a 25 percent chance at getting the pick. In practice, the odds of getting the top pick have proved even harder than that, with just four teams in 30 seasons receiving the top pick after having the league\u2019s worst record. Because of the disincentive to lose, Silver said, he believes that all teams are working toward success in their own ways and that any tweak would simply be to convince the public of that. \u201cWe want to ensure our fans that our teams are always undergoing a process to try to field the best possible team on the floor,\u201d he said. At its last meeting, the league\u2019s Board of Governors considered a proposal to discourage teams from tanking, and while a majority of the teams supported the idea, it did not reach the 75 percent threshold needed to pass. Silver may believe that no team is losing on purpose, but as the season winds down, and the Knicks consider shutting down Carmelo Anthony so he can recover from his various injuries, that belief may be tested.

Average ticket prices had spiked in the last couple of days, after dipping to $1,760 on Feb. 8 following a high of $3,770 on Jan. 24. The cheapest tickets were being sold for $964, while the most expensive ticket was in Section 107 (center court), eight rows up. That was listed recently for $10,200.

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE STRATEGY; SHIFTING TACTICS, BUSH USES ISSUES TO CONFRONT GORE - The New York Times Faced with an opponent who has managed to deflect questions about his character and trustworthiness, Gov. George W. Bush has shifted tactics and begun confronting Vice President Al Gore head-on over the issues, an area long considered to be Mr. Gore's greatest strength. Day after day this week, from one coast to the other, Mr. Bush has sought to draw contrasts between his positions on Medicare, the environment, education and tax cuts and those of his rival. And to amplify the theme, his campaign began running a new advertisement in 18 swing states comparing the two candidates' programs. ''Al Gore's prescription plan forces seniors into a government-run H.M.O.,'' says the commercial. ''Governor Bush gives seniors a choice. Gore says he's for school accountability, but requires no real testing. Governor Bush requires tests and holds schools accountable for results.'' The commercial also says that ''Gore's targeted tax cut leaves out 50 million people -- half of all taxpayers.'' At the same time, Mr. Bush's running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, has been using blunt language this week to criticize Mr. Gore's positions on the economy, health care and education. [Page A11.] The tack is a change in emphasis that Mr. Bush's advisers say is every bit as important as the Texas governor's recent decision to court voters in more unscripted settings. Just last week, Mr. Bush was hammering at Mr. Gore's personal credibility and character. All year, the emotional center of the Bush campaign has been a pledge to bring ''dignity and honor'' back to the White House after the Clinton years."]
["us", "But with some polls showing a slight Gore edge and others showing a statistical dead heat, Mr. Bush's advisers say that he can no longer count on questions of personality and character to carry him into the White House, and that he needs to go after Mr. Gore on the issues that voters put at the top of their list of concerns. ''There was a thought we needed to go much more pointedly at issues and show these differences,'' one Bush aide said. ''Everybody agreed we needed to be much more pointed in drawing contrast.'' The Bush campaign argues that it can change the way the public is thinking about the issues, in much the same way that Republicans and their allies dampened enthusiasm for President Clinton's plan for universal health care coverage by persuading the public that the proposal amounted to government intrusion in private lives. The plan died in 1994 and the Republicans went on to win control of Congress. ''Just like President Clinton's failed health care effort in 1993, we believe that the more people look at the details of Al Gore's plans, the less they'll like,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''The more they look, the less they'll see.'' The new Bush effort reflects a fundamental change in the dynamics of the presidential race. Throughout the spring and summer polls showed that Mr. Bush had a comfortable lead that was built in large part on personality and on public dismay with President Clinton's personal morality. Polls found that voters had judged Mr. Bush more likable than Mr. Gore and more of a leader."]
["us", "While Mr. Bush has consistently talked about the issues, holding policy speech after policy speech, he mostly set out his own plans without drawing sharp contrasts to Mr. Gore's proposals. Before the Republican convention, his aides had said the issue speeches were largely designed to bolster impressions of Mr. Bush as a strong leader. That the Republican dared to propose changes in Social Security or that he said he would consider changes in nuclear doctrine made him look like a bold leader willing to challenge the status quo, his aides said. Then came the Democratic National Convention. During that critical period, Republicans now acknowledge, Mr. Gore did everything that he needed to do. By choosing Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate, he managed to separate himself from Mr. Clinton. Polls now show that the vice president is as highly regarded as Mr. Bush when it comes to traits like leadership, character and personal popularity. If both men are viewed as personable and strong leaders, that shifts the focus of the race to the issues. Indeed, a survey of 2,000 voters, released this week by The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, concluded that ''clearly, issues have fueled Gore's gains.'' Mr. Bush's advisers say they have not abandoned efforts to raise questions about Mr. Gore's credibility. Mr. Bush, for example, jumped on new reports that federal investigators are examining the Democrats' efforts in 1996 to raise money from a handful of Texas trial lawyers."]
["us", "But Mr. Bush's aides say he needs to talk about credibility in the context of issues. One strategist close to the Bush campaign said recent focus groups with voters had shown that while Mr. Gore had shaken off questions about his character, there were still doubts about him just below the surface. He said those doubts could be used to push people back into the undecided category. ''The difference between now and seven or eight weeks ago,'' the strategist said, ''is that before you could go straight at credibility issues. You could say, 'Al Gore: how can you believe anything he says?' People would nod and say, 'That's right.' Now people want to hear the comparison on the issues. Then you can bring up credibility and it's more viable.'' The Republican strategist said that the shift in perception was subtle but that ''it means we won't run away with this election.'' ''We will have to aggressively compete on the issues,'' the strategist said. Another Bush adviser said, ''Pointing out issue differences is a way of pointing out credibility differences.'' The difficulty for Mr. Bush is that, unlike in the 1980's when issues like crime and taxes and the cold war favored the Republicans, this year's top voters' concerns -- health care and education -- are subjects on which Democrats have long had an edge. Still, Mr. Bush's advisers contend that their candidate has already narrowed the traditional Democratic advantage on education and Social Security. And they say that he can prevail on the issues if he reshapes the public debate."]
["us", "Ralph Reed, a Bush adviser, said the campaign would now focus on the details of Mr. Gore's plans. ''We'll say he's got bad ideas,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Not just that his ideas are not as good as our ideas, but that they could harm people. People might not get the drugs they need because of price controls.'' Mr. Reed was referring to the accusation made by Mr. Bush and by the drug industry that Mr. Gore's proposal to create a new prescription drug benefit inside the traditional Medicare program would create such a government buying monopoly for drugs that it would amount to price controls. In another line of attack on Mr. Gore's Medicare plan, the Republican National Committee is also running a new advertisement. Speaking of Mr. Gore's prescription proposal, an announcer says, ''He says he wants to fight for the people against H.M.O.'s, but his prescription drug plan forces seniors into one H.M.O. selected by the government. Al Gore: federal H.M.O. George Bush: seniors choose.'' The reference to H.M.O.'s echoes Mr. Gore's criticism of Mr. Bush's own Medicare plan, which would foster competition between Medicare and private insurers and encourage recipients to opt into government-subsidized private health plans with prescription drug coverage. The Gore campaign says the proposal would force more and more people out of Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program and into health maintenance organizations."]
["us", "''It's no surprise that they are trying to distort the issue because it's so plain that Bush's plan puts seniors off on the tender mercies of the H.M.O.'s,'' Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said in response to the Republican spots. ''He knows that's one of the main vulnerabilities of his plan, so he's trying desperately to turn it around.'' One question for Mr. Bush is precisely how to frame the contrasts on the issues. He has spent the year presenting himself as a ''different kind of Republican'' who is less hostile to government than the Republicans who gained control of Congress  in 1994. But some of his appeals recently have been sharply ideological, skating close to the traditional right-left confrontation over the role of government. Mr. Bush's advisers say he wants to present himself as a conservative reformer who is more market oriented and innovative while painting Mr. Gore as favoring government-run command and control policies that deny individuals choices. Mr. Bush says he is game for the fight. At a rally in California on Wednesday, he said: ''We've got a big debate on the issues during the campaign. And by the way, I love talking about the issues on the campaign, because we stand with the majority of the people when we talk about the issues.''"]
["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO; Faulty Assumptions Led Bush to Err on Debates - The New York Times When Gov. George W. Bush initially announced that he wanted to take part in only one of the three debates proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and two others on individual television networks, he and his senior aides made two central assumptions. One was that voters did not care -- or know -- much about the commission. The other was that news organizations would hold Vice President Al Gore's feet to the fire for having said, in the past, that he would participate in network debates. On the first point, it is impossible to know whether Mr. Bush and his aides were right or wrong. But on the second, it is now clear that they made what even they admit was a significant miscalculation. By Thursday, less than two weeks after Mr. Bush had staked his original position, he had agreed to the entirety of the three-debate schedule outlined by the commission. And several Republican strategists and even a few Republican officials who advise the campaign said that most of what the Bush campaign succeeded in doing over that period of time was making the candidate look halting and nervous. ''In the end, I don't know that it mattered much,'' said an official with ties to the Bush campaign, adding that voters probably paid little heed to the debate over debates."]
["us", "But, the official said, referring to the Bush campaign: ''They overplayed it. There's a thing with public perception that they're still dealing with: Is he deep enough? Is he heavy enough? And every time they go through one of these drills, it looks like they're trying to protect him from something.'' Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the campaign, said Mr. Bush emerged from the process in a good position. She said that the formats the campaigns agreed to in negotiations on Saturday were more ''free-flowing'' and less ''stilted'' than they would have been had Mr. Bush not pressed his case. Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, disputed that assessment, saying that ''the package that's been agreed to is exactly what the commission had hoped for'' and was always among the options. Ms. Hughes also said that the impetus behind the alternate proposal was that ''we were trying to make sure the formats would be different and interesting, that the widest possible audience would watch.'' ''We fully expected the media would help us demand that Vice President Gore live up to his word,'' she said. ''Had the shoes been reversed, I think we would still be talking about why Governor Bush had backed off his word.'' But Republican officials said that the Bush campaign failed to take several realities into account. They said that because of Mr. Gore's reputation as an adept debater, the story line accompanying Mr. Bush's desire for alternate formats was bound to pivot on the question of whether he was trying to minimize the impact of the debates."]
["us", "And that question, they said, was fueled by the nature of the Bush plan.  The commission had proposed 90-minute debates that would be broadcast by all the television networks; Mr. Bush had proposed 60-minute sessions likely to be shown only by the network sponsoring them. It looked, said one strategist who occasionally advises the campaign, like a dodge. ''You can't take sulfuric acid and put it in a nice Tiffany box and say it's drinking water,'' the adviser said. Other advisers said that the Bush campaign believed that it could successfully use the debate over debates to press the charge that Mr. Gore did not live up to his word. After all, the campaign released snippets of videotape in which Mr. Gore emphatically said he wanted to debate Mr. Bush on the network news programs that Mr. Bush was suggesting. Several advisers said that they thought it would be a strong opening salvo as the campaign entered the newly intense phase after Labor Day and sought to halt the momentum Mr. Gore was carrying out of his convention. ''It was just clear that the vice president did pretty well in the first week or two after the convention and there needed to be a strategic offensive,'' said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman who serves as an informal campaign adviser. ''This was one way of taking control for a moment and forcing the vice president to respond,'' he said."]
["us", "But, as other advisers conceded, the strategy backfired. ''They didn't get that the story line about Bush was already set: you're a scaredy- cat,'' one adviser said. So when the Gore campaign declined the network debates, saying that his agreement to do them had been predicated on doing the three commission debates for starters, few news accounts or editorials quibbled with his position. The degree to which the Bush campaign expected and counted on a different reaction from news organizations was reflected in its release, following Mr. Bush's initial announcement, of a commercial that used the snippets of videotape to accuse Mr. Gore of double-speak. The commercial was released in a handful of markets, with the main goal being to generate more news coverage of Mr. Bush's position. Several Bush advisers said they began discussing alternate formats even before the party conventions. By the Labor Day weekend, they said, there was a consensus between the candidate and his aides. ''A lot of people thought it was a very good strategy,'' Ms. Hughes said, alluding to some of the subsequent second-guessing by Republicans outside of Austin. ''I would say a number of people whose ZIP code is Washington, D.C.'' The strategy was motivated by several factors, advisers said. A few said that its principal proponent was Mr. Bush, who they said inherited from his father a general dislike of the commission, a feeling that it tried to dictate terms to candidates and that its formats did not flatter President Bush in 1992. Other advisers disputed that contention."]
["us", "In addition, Mr. Bush's aides felt at the time that the public did not care who sponsored the debates. ''We're not stupid,'' one adviser said several weeks ago. ''We've been looking at this. Nobody knows who the commission is.'' Several said they and Mr. Bush believed that the debates would be better suited to him if they were conversational and informal, and they thought that because they were proposing an early debate to be moderated on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' by Tim Russert, a widely respected interviewer, reporters would not see their position as a timid one. But several Republican strategists said that the Bush campaign did not realize that during a period in which Mr. Gore's poll numbers were rising, much of what Mr. Bush did was bound to be interpreted as defensive. One Republican strategist said that beyond the pounding in the news media that the Bush campaign suffered over the course of this, it had also inadvertently strengthened the commission's hand in the future, by first objecting to its power and control and then seeming to surrender. ''That's the terrible-ness of this,'' said the strategist. ''The commission is now a beast that lives on.''"]

["world", "Boutros-Ghali's Query to Albright: 'What Went Wrong?' - The New York Times Correction Appended A couple of weeks ago, after Madeleine K. Albright had finally ended Boutros Boutros-Ghali's hopes of a second term as Secretary General, the defeated and dispirited Egyptian diplomat at last got his chance to ask Ms. Albright, by then President Clinton's choice as Secretary of State, a few undiplomatic questions. ''What went wrong?'' he asked over a private farewell dinner at his official residence. ''Why this campaign against me for six months?'' Mr. Boutros-Ghali might as well have called the State Department spokesman. ''She gave me the official interpretation,'' he recalled today, a few hours before he walked out of the United Nations as Secretary General for the last time and into a New York drizzle as frosty as his relations with the White House. Adding a bizarre touch to the evening, Ms. Albright brushed aside Mr. Boutros-Ghali's pleas for an explanation and chose the occasion to seek a favor instead. ''She asked me to help her in relations with the Arabs,'' said Mr. Boutros-Ghali, a pivotal figure in negotiating the 1979 Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel. ''She made the point that she knew because she was against my re-election the Arab world was not happy.'' Ms. Albright is now preparing for Senate hearings over confirming her as Secretary of State after four years as the chief American delegate to the United Nations. As the Middle East is likely to be a major and continuing concern of a new Secretary of State, her triumphant campaign to oust Mr. Boutros-Ghali may have some unintended consequences in her new post, if she is approved as expected."]
["world", "A senior Administration official confirmed Mr. Boutros-Ghali's account of the conversation, saying that Ms. Albright only wanted to ''tap into his knowledge of the players in the Middle East.'' ''She asked him for an assessment of things,'' the official said. ''She thinks he's quite wise in that area.'' Mr. Boutros-Ghali said that he had answered her questions about the Middle East ''like a good Boy Scout,'' but that he would not be much help in the immediate future. He leaves for Paris tomorrow as Kofi Annan of Ghana takes over as his successor. After relaxing at a European spa, he said, he will take off six months to reflect on his five years here, dividing his time between homes in Paris and Cairo. Then he plans to write his memoirs of the Middle East during the years of President Anwar el-Sadat. The book is to be published by Random House in April. Clinton Administration officials have long insisted that their decision to deny Mr. Boutros-Ghali a second term stemmed from policy differences, not personal animosity. But now that the battle is over, it is clear that the 74-year old Egyptian diplomat perceived the campaign as a personal assault on his record, his integrity and his pride. ''There were two questions I asked,'' he said today, recalling his last conversation with Ms. Albright. ''One was why they made this decision. Then, after they made it, why this general war on me? They could have used the veto without necessarily doing what they have done.''"]
["world", "He said that for six months, Administration officials ordered American embassies around the world to drum up opposition to his candidacy while warning United Nations officials not to campaign on his behalf. Despite that, 14 of 15 Security Council members voted in November to give him a second term. An American veto, cast by Ms. Albright as the United States representative, overrode that vote. Ms. Albright has said she continues to respect Mr. Boutros-Ghali personally. But today, the departing Secretary General said he felt a noticeable shift in his relations with the Clinton Administration about two years ago, after the Republican sweep of Congress. Until then, he said, relations with Ms. Albright and the White House were excellent despite occasional spats. He remains persuaded that he was sacrificed for domestic political gain. He said today that when he asked Ms. Albright to explain, he was given the public version of events: that he had asked initially for only one term and that was all that Washington was prepared to accept. Officials have also said that he was a very reluctant reformer and that his presence was impeding efforts to get Congress to pay the $1.3 billion debt that the United States owes the United Nations. ''I believe that the break came with the beginnings of attacks by Republicans -- Dole's Booootros Booootros-Ghali, the black helicopters and the bad image of the United Nations,'' Mr. Boutros-Ghali said, referring to Bob Dole's mocking use of his name to signify foreign interference and the rumors spread by far-right groups that United Nations forces were about to invade America. ''The symbol of the United Nations is the Secretary General.''"]
["world", "Ms. Albright led the chorus in anticipation of the confirmation hearings if Mr. Clinton nominated her as Secretary of State. ''She was trying to promote herself,'' he said. ''If you are attacking the United Nations, you are with the others.'' In addition to directing the successful campaign to oust Mr. Boutros-Ghali, Ms. Albright also engendered criticism among Arabs when she argued against his decision to publish a report critical of Israel for its attack on the Qana refugee camp in southern Lebanon in April, which killed more than 100 refugees. The United Nations report, made public in May, said the attack was not a mistake as Israel insisted. Trying to block the report, Ms. Albright told the Secretary General that publication could damage American peace efforts. He replied that a United Nations installation had been shelled and it was his duty to investigate what had happened. In an interview in November, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said associates had told him that the decision to publish the report, written by European military experts working for the United Nations, would cost him the Secretary General's job. American officials deny this, saying a decision to veto his re-election had already been made by then. What annoyed the Clinton Administration more, the senior United States official said today, was a dispute in December 1995 between Mr. Boutros-Ghali and Ms. Albright over what kind of force should police the Croatian region of eastern Slavonia when the United Nations turned over peacekeeping in Bosnia to NATO."]
["world", "Mr. Boutros-Ghali, stung by charges that the United Nations had been too weak in Bosnia, wanted NATO to take on eastern Slavonia also. The Clinton Administration, trying to limit American troop involvement, pressed -- and won -- the battle to create a United Nations force, though led by an American, Jacques Klein. The operation has been a great success, in large part because of the swashbuckling style of Mr. Klein. In a ruminative ''Agenda for Democracy'' that Mr. Boutros-Ghali has written in the form of a parting letter to the 185-member General Assembly, he said the nations of the world, not only the people, need to be democratic. The reference was to the United States and other countries with the power to ignore the view of a majority of nations. ''Democracy will not succeed if it is limited to within member states,'' he said. ''We need democracy among member states. If global problems are solved by authoritarian means and national problems are solved by democracy, it will not work.'' Correction: January 4, 1997, Saturday    Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his last day as United Nations Secretary General misstated his plans for a new book. He intends to write one, but the subject has not been determined; a memoir of his years in the Middle East has already been completed and is to be published in April by Random House."]
["sports", "Mets\u2019 Yoenis Cespedes Takes the Good With the Ugly - The New York Times KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014  Alex Gordon has played most of his nine-year career in left field at Kaufmann Stadium, catching hundreds of balls in the exact spot where Yoenis Cespedes dropped an eminently catchable line drive Sunday night, the latest of his numerous lightning rod moments. Left field is not a particularly treacherous position here. There are no walls jutting in at odd angles, no overhangs or extreme wind tunnels. During night games a ball might get lost in the lights, but Gordon said that hazard is more in left-center field, which, of course, is where Cespedes was tripped up last October in Game 1 of the World Series. In that instance, Cespedes misplayed a ball hit by Alcides Escobar, the Royals\u2019 first hitter of the game, turning it into an inside-the-park home run. On Sunday night, the mishap again came in the first inning, but this time it was on a ball hit by the second batter of the game for Kansas City. In this instance, Mike Moustakas was safe on a glaring error by Cespedes and eventually scored the first unearned run of the Mets\u2019 season, contributing to a 4-3 win by the Royals. It was a game with numerous echoes of last year\u2019s World Series: hustling play and fine defense by the Royals, some weak-looking throws by Mets third baseman David Wright, and a befuddling blunder by Cespedes, who is usually a defensive asset, not a liability."]
["sports", "\u201cAs an outfielder, I can speak about if it happened to me,\u201d Gordon said when asked about Cespedes after Sunday night\u2019s game. \u201cI would look at myself and say, \u2018That can\u2019t happen.\u2019 As an outfielder, I would feel terrible if that happened, maybe just getting a little lazy.\u201d Gordon added: \u201cHe\u2019s a good outfielder so he makes a lot of great plays. It\u2019s just unfortunate that two games against us he dropped a couple of balls.\u201d Actually, Cespedes is a Gold Glove-winning left fielder who is somewhat less effective when the Mets ask him to play in center. Wherever he plays, he has one of the best outfield arms in the game. He also has a formidable bat and a penchant for the spotlight. Whether he will be with the Mets for just this year or for at least two more seasons depends on if he chooses to opt out of the three-year, $75 million contract that he signed this past winter. But based on his short time in New York, and some offbeat behavior during spring training, Cespedes\u2019s tenure here seems destined to be provocative, entertaining, even exhilarating at times, and also occasionally quite maddening. Sunday fell into the last category. Not only did Cespedes make another first-inning error, but he also struck out flailing against Wade Davis, the Royals\u2019 superb closer, to end the game in the top of the ninth with the tying run at third base."]
["sports", "With Cespedes, the Mets seem to be learning, there is always the possibility of delight and the potential for the exact opposite. \u201cEvery time he comes up, you know there is a possibility that some damage will be done,\u201d said Gordon, who saw plenty of Cespedes when Cespedes played in the American League before being traded to the Mets last July 31. \u201cHe is a dangerous player,\u201d Gordon added. \u201cVery explosive.\u201d Occasionally, the explosions can be negative, as in last year\u2019s World Series. In Game 1, Cespedes was in center field when Escobar hit the first pitch he saw from Matt Harvey, who, as it happens, was also on the mound for the Mets on Sunday night. Cespedes could not catch the ball Escobar hit, but worse, he kicked it, and Escobar circled the bases to score the first run of the game. Six months later, in his first fielding chance of 2016, Cespedes flubbed another ball. It actually went into the webbing of his glove, but inexplicably popped out. \u201cThe ball just fell,\u201d Cespedes said through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d Last month in spring training, Cespedes inadvertently committed an amusing, and widely replayed, blunder when he declined to pick up a ball that was hit over his head and rolled to the base of the outfield wall. Cespedes, claiming the ball was stuck under the wall and thus unplayable, wanted the umpires to declare it a ground-rule double. But the umpires did no such thing. So the at-bat ended up as another inside-the-park home run, not that it really mattered."]
["sports", "Still, the three unusual plays by Cespedes have come in proximity to one another and raise the question: Is there a pattern here, or just a bunch of fluky moments? Terry Collins, the Mets\u2019 manager, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d that Cespedes dropped the ball Sunday, but, over all, said he was not worried. The three plays, Collins said, were unrepresentative of anything worrisome. \u201cHe dropped it,\u201d Collins said of Sunday\u2019s error. \u201cIt happens. The play in the World Series is a completely different situation, and the one in Florida, to be honest, was pretty funny.\u201d The Mets were delighted to be able to re-sign Cespedes in the off-season \u2014 for a good while, few thought they would \u2014 and there should be numerous games this season that he will win for them almost single-handedly, as he did often last season after joining the team. And there may also be a few games sprinkled in like Sunday\u2019s, when Cespedes will do things that leave Mets fans confounded. Cespedes was understandably grumpy after Sunday\u2019s loss. He made it obvious that he did not want to speak with reporters, but did so grudgingly at the insistence of the Mets\u2019 longtime public relations director, Jay Horwitz. In the brief interview, Cespedes was asked if he saw any similarities in the atmosphere at Kauffman Stadium between the World Series and Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cAll the games to me are the same,\u201d he said."]
["sports", "In the case of the Mets versus the Royals, that statement was more accurate than perhaps Cespedes meant it to be. The teams have played six times since the start of last year\u2019s World Series, and the Royals have won five. Another game will be played here Tuesday afternoon and the teams will meet again, in June, at Citi Field. Perhaps by then Cespedes will be on one of his tears, hitting the lights out of the baseball rather than dropping it."]
["national", "A NATION CHALLENGED: NEWS ANALYSIS; City of Power, City of Fears - The New York Times Anthrax is not contagious, but fear is. There was ample evidence of that today, the most unsettling day this taut city has seen since Sept. 11.  Whoever has made a target of newsrooms and Capitol Hill offices with letters containing white powder or other contaminants has succeeded in sowing confusion and anxiety, verging on terror, among the chattering classes of Washington -- the people who set the capital's tone. ''A war of nerves is being fought in Washington,'' a senior administration official said, ''and I fear we're not doing as well as we might be.'' As with the first terrorist assaults, in New York and at the Pentagon, the government has been caught completely by surprise by the anthrax attacks. Slow to conclude that terrorism might be involved, the administration has been slower to provide definitive guidance to the public. Congress did no better today. With word that more than 30 workers on Capitol Hill had tested positive for exposure to anthrax, House and Senate officials were unable to present a united front at a moment of crisis. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert announced that the House would go home until Tuesday; the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, said the Senate would stay. A bleak comedy of contradiction ensued, played out against the swelling fear of a potentially lethal, totally invisible enemy. At day's end, leadership was the clear casualty. Perhaps most damaging was the lack of definitive public information about the source, nature and intensity of the exposure."]
["national", "Although a veneer of civility was maintained in public, senators of both parties privately sneered at Mr. Hastert's decision, which had been seconded by the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. One Republican said the House's message to the nation was, ''Let's close everything down and get out of town, pronto.'' Not that all Washington was gripped by panic. For most people, here as elsewhere in the country, life unfolded in its usual, matter-of-fact way. On a crystalline fall day when the city's monuments looked as crisp as the buildings in a Sheeler painting, fallen leaves blew briskly down suburban streets, travelers filled the coffee bars at Union Station, and tens of thousands of bureaucrats hammered away at tens of thousands of computers. Ordinary folk were no doubt worried. But at 4 o'clock moms and stand-ins picked up children all over town, and numberless office televisions were switched to the broadcast of the American League Championship Series. On Capitol Hill, where 20,000 people work in the various Congressional buildings, the mood was much tenser. Hundreds lined up for anthrax tests, and most of the rest exchanged anxious telephone and e-mail messages. Some offices sent staff members home. Outside the Capitol itself, which has been swept clear of vehicles and most visitors, a weird, wary silence prevailed, and within its corridors a bunker mentality took forceful hold. Likewise, in news offices where bioterrorism squads searched for anthrax spores, talk centered on powders, nasal swabs and antibiotics."]
["national", "President Bush left the city this morning for California, on his way to a conference in Shanghai. Aides said there had been a lively debate about the trip, with some officials arguing that he should stay here until the anthrax scare was resolved. But the president, the aides said, sided with those who insisted that he must go through with the trip if he expected the country to take seriously his repeated urging to get on with life as usual. Still, his absence left it to others to try to keep things in perspective as reports of new anthrax exposures rolled in, not only from Mr. Daschle's office, where an anthrax-laced letter was opened on Monday morning, but elsewhere on the Senate side. The secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, did his best in testimony on Capitol Hill, but his credibility was undercut days ago when he asserted, with insufficient facts to back his claim, that the first case of anthrax, in Florida, was isolated. Nor have Mr. Thompson and Tom Ridge, Mr. Bush's new homeland defense czar, worked out a clear division of responsibilities. In office for only a few days, Mr. Ridge has been mostly out of sight as the anthrax scare has developed. Hobbled by lack of information, other arms of government could do little to provide reassurance. In 10 days, investigative agencies have made almost no progress in pinpointing the origins of the anthrax contamination."]
["national", "For its part, the Congressional leadership was unable to provide much leadership, either to Washington or to the nation as a whole. Mr. Hastert said he was acting out of prudence, but one man's prudence in a situation like the present one can feed others' panic, and he was criticized pitilessly by his peers on the ground that he was setting a poor example. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican who ran against Mr. Bush in the primaries last year, said he intended to make a series of radio and television appearances in the next few days to try to convince people that for now the anthrax threat had been grossly exaggerated. ''We have had one death from this stuff, and three other confirmed cases,'' he said. ''Two of those three are a milder form of the disease. More people have been struck by lightning in the last 10 days, I'll bet, than have contracted anthrax. The country badly needs to settle down. ''There's nothing wrong with being afraid. What we have to do as leaders is help people to get on top of their fear and channel it into something useful, rather than crossing that narrow line between fear and panic.''"]
["national", "But it is not easy to cut through the dense crust of anxiety that has been built up in the last month or so. At the bottom is the general sense of insecurity created by the shocking attacks of Sept. 11. Next came a warning from the F.B.I., without particulars, that more terrorist incidents might be imminent. Official Washington being what it is, that warning was taken by many here to apply with special force to the capital. And then came the anthrax threat in Congress, where many members and their staffs were already jumpy because of a belief that one of the planes hijacked on Sept. 11 -- perhaps the one that crashed in Pennsylvania -- had been aimed at the Capitol. Anxiety is grounded in fear, of course, and fear is grounded in ignorance. Until the government is able to develop better information about the anthrax attacks, and provide more comprehensive means to combat them (like cheaper, more readily available stocks of Cipro and other antibiotics), days like today are bound to recur."]

Other Jeep and Chrysler owners, citing many similar accidents \u2014 if no other deaths \u2014 say that the transmission shifter used in his car and some other models is confusing and not intuitive. A quick read of the owner\u2019s manual might have helped some drivers avoid thinking the car was safely in parking gear when it was not. But whatever one\u2019s opinion is of a car gear shifter that requires special instructions to operate, an anomaly of the Fiat Chrysler fiasco is this: The company is actually an industry leader when it comes to providing state-of-the-art user guides for its increasingly complex vehicles.

["automobiles/wheels", "So auto companies increasingly are using apps, onscreen displays, videos and other technological means to familiarize the digitally adept buyer with the multitude of features in their highly computerized vehicles. \u201cThe question is, What do millennials expect from their cars, now that they view them as an operating system?\u201d said Prof. Maggie Hendrie, chairwoman of the Interaction Design program at ArtCenter College of Design, in Los Angeles. \u201cToday, we learn about a car\u2019s functions through trial and error,\u2019\u2019 Professor Hendrie said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we expect context-specific help built into the vehicle.\u201d Or we might look at the YouTube videos created by vehicle fans, as well as online forums populated by a particular make\u2019s enthusiasts, which often provide better answers than the pages written by a manufacturer. \u201cIf I ever had an issue with my car, I\u2019d do a Google search before I read the manual,\u201d said Akshay Anand, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. In some ways Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and other digital adopters are simply trying to catch up to their user communities. But they are also adopting digital instructions because cars have become so complex and feature-laden that printed manuals, with their step-by-step instructions and myriad legal warnings, are becoming unwieldy. If Fiat Chrysler still printed its manual, it would be 700 pages long and contain 240,000 words, said Tricia Hecker, head of the company\u2019s connected vehicle group.

["automobiles/wheels", "Fiat Chrysler first went to a digital user\u2019s guide in 2009, mainly as a money-saving step when the company was in dire financial straits. But the initial effort was blandly utilitarian. \u201cIt was just a regurgitation of the printed manual,\u201d Ms. Hecker said. Today, though, the company offers smartphone app versions of all its vehicle manuals. Users can search for instructions by topic, concept or alphabetically. Videos are often embedded in the instructions. The Fiat Chrysler app also gives users a place to write and email pertinent information after an accident, as well as a listing of maintenance schedules, active recalls and an accessory shop. Toyota\u2019s owner\u2019s manuals are available as smartphone apps and on the website.

Limited augmented reality is also available with Fiat Chrysler\u2019s owners\u2019 app. By hovering a smartphone over the vehicle instrument cluster, users can read text-based explanations of each warning light\u2019s function. An owner\u2019s app for BMWs performs a similar function to help users solve the riddles of the various buttons in the car. Manufacturers are also beginning to make some of the information on the smartphone apps available through the vehicle\u2019s dashboard digital display. Fiat Chrysler has done so for its Chrysler 300 and Pacifica models, as well as the Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger, showing users how to connect a garage door opener to the vehicle\u2019s controls. Since this migration, use of the app\u2019s help feature has risen to 16 percent of owners, from only 5 percent before, Ms. Hecker said. Tesla, the maker of expensive all-electric cars, has always offered its owner\u2019s guide through its vehicles\u2019 giant 17-inch touch screens.

["style/international", "Lebanese Jewelry Brand Vanina Has a Social Message - The New York Times PARIS \u2014 When high inflation hit the Lebanese economy in 2007, two designers turned their country\u2019s weakened currency into gold. The designers, Joanne Hayek and Tatiana Fayad, who were university students at the time, started making jewelry from depreciated coins as a \u201cspontaneous hobby,\u201d they said. They then turned it into a business. Since their casual foray into designing accessories, the Beirut-based pair has used the concept of upcycling \u2014 reusing discarded or low-value material to create a higher-quality product \u2014 to turn their line, Vanina, into an international brand with a social message. Vanina\u2019s latest and most opulent collection, Still Life, gives used, nonbiodegradable plastic bags a major upgrade in a collaboration with Swarovski. The nature-inspired geometric designs feature blossoming necklaces and earrings with Swarovski crystals as their centerpieces.

Ms. Hayek, who studied architecture, uses 3-D modeling software to calculate the number of plastic bags needed to conform to a crystal\u2019s size and shape and the form that the piece will take. The jewelry is then hand stitched at the designers\u2019 atelier near Beirut. The designers, who named their brand Vanina after a 1970s pop song in French, said in an interview in Paris that they drew inspiration from the history of Beirut, as complicated as that history can sometimes seem."]
["style/international", "\u201cBeirut is inspiring in two ways for us,\u201d Ms. Hayek said. \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s full of energy and beauty. At the same time, there are so many issues we force ourselves not to see, but they are still there.\u201d Ms. Fayad and Ms. Hayek met when they were 14. They had always known that they wanted to work together when they were older, Ms. Fayad said, but weren\u2019t sure how. Although neither had plans to plunge into fashion, the industry was a natural fit for Ms. Fayad, whose mother owns a shop in Beirut. She grew up accompanying her mother to showrooms, and took an interest in the whole process of fashion, from design to commerce. When the young women decided to convert their jewelry-making pastime into jobs \u2014 while they were still in university \u2014 it was a simple transition, said Ms. Fayad, who studied marketing. \u201cWe were learning so much in our studies, and directly applying it right there with the brand,\u201d she said. The success of their first collection, made with the depreciated coins \u2014 and still Vanina\u2019s best seller \u2014 inspired them to continue coupling design with social activism. \u201cEveryone had a jar of those coins at home. There was an emotional attachment to the lira,\u201d Ms. Hayek said, using an alternate name for the Lebanese pound. \u201cWe realized that fashion can deal with different areas of society and could be more than just dressing you up. It was a tool in our hand.\u201d"]
["style/international", "The designers have used that tool to extend their brand\u2019s social platform, touching on issues as far-ranging as environmental consciousness and war. Vanina\u2019s Unlocked collection, made from gems and recycled keys, is \u201can invitation to keep doors open,\u201d Ms. Hayek said, adding that the message is applicable to both politics and personal situations. For their Cease-Fire collection, the designers teamed up with the nongovernmental organization Permanent Peace Movement, which works to reduce the spread of small arms. A portion of the proceeds from the line are given to the NGO. Stems made to look like matchsticks, with rainbow-colored tips and assembled in a fanlike shape on a gold chain, form a Cleopatra-collar necklace. Their Grenade Earrings are made of a cluster of stones with an arc of shortened stems. Naturally, each piece comes in a branded matchbox. Fadi Abi Allam, the executive director of Permanent Peace Movement, said that this kind of collaboration between NGOs and private companies was rare in the region. While the line has not raised a large amount for the organization, Mr. Abi Allam said its message was important. \u201cThe terminology \u2018cease-fire\u2019 means a lot: It\u2019s the first step towards peace in a war,\u201d Mr. Abi Allam said. \u201cLet\u2019s make the value of Cease-Fire itself not the money, but the awareness. The value is the same as $1 million for me.\u201d With Vanina retail points in Dubai, New York, Paris and Tokyo, among other cities, Ms. Hayek and Ms. Fayad have made their collection grow into a budding global brand without outside investment, they say."]

["us", "THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE NEWS MEDIA; Bush Finds a Minus to Coziness With Reporters - The New York Times The presidential race may be neck and neck, but there is one place Gov. George W. Bush has cut back on his campaigning. The rear of his own plane. Until a few days ago, the Republican nominee would stroll the aisle of the campaign's chartered Boeing 757 to chat with reporters traveling with him. But the visits became fewer and farther between after Mr. Bush's aides found that the networks preferred those informal moments to the staged events of the day. And reporters, in turn, began to object when the campaign insisted that the governor's conversations at 30,000 feet had to be off the record. ''We discovered they were using shots from the plane on the evening news,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''And because Gore wasn't doing 'avails' like that, the networks were using shots from his events.'' After months of romancing the media, the Bush campaign is learning about the downside of courtship. Unlike the campaign of Vice President Al Gore, which has strictly limited the candidate's access, Mr. Bush and his advisers have provided a steady diet of the kind of ''availabilities'' that reporters crave. Even on days that he can anticipate tough encounters -- as on the morning last week when articles appeared quoting prominent Republicans expressing worries about the state of the Bush campaign -- the governor met with reporters."]
["us", "''He took questions for 20 minutes,'' said Walter Shapiro, a columnist for USA Today, ''and the consensus of the reporters I talked to was that this was a gutsy performance.'' In providing the access, Mr. Bush's aides have also learned how piercing the double-edged sword can be, for making the governor available almost every day has given reporters and camera crews a greater degree of autonomy within the highly controlled confines of a presidential campaign. Mr. Gore, by contrast, was for weeks this summer virtually unavailable for daily questions from reporters, a practice that may have irritated the media, but certainly gave him tighter control over the ideas and images the campaign sought to convey. As the experience of the photo opportunities on the Bush plane demonstrated, access does not guarantee cooperative coverage. In fact, Mr. Bush appears at times to grant the media license to knock him completely off his message. When, for instance, Mr. Bush surprised the media last month with an admission aboard the campaign plane that he had to do a better job of  making clear his plan for a tax cut, some reporters used his candor as the foundation for stories about a campaign in disarray. The pattern continued today, as Mr. Bush appeared on the tarmac of Orlando International Airport and faced several questions about a report in The New York Times that the word ''rats'' shows up for a split second in an anti-Gore commercial by the Republican National Committee."]
["us", "CNN led its midafternoon newscast today with its follow-up to the report. ''No detail is too small or too fleeting to cause a controversy,'' a CNN anchor noted. In its piece about Mr. Bush's tarmac appearance, the network also pointed out that Mr. Bush mispronounced ''subliminal'' four times. Nelson Warfield, who served as Bob Dole's press secretary during the 1996 presidential campaign, said: ''Another day of message lost for a guy in a neck-and-neck race. The Bush campaign is a highly disciplined operation, and I think they are convinced their message will penetrate. He doesn't want to become a bumbler and he isn't yet. But this is not a helpful thing.'' In what sometimes can sound like an echo of his former rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the governor often speaks of his respect for reporters as if he genuinely likes them. In a question-and-answer session Mr. Bush held with workers at a high-technology company in Warrendale, Pa., on Friday, the first two questioners were critical of what they saw as the way the press distorted Mr. Bush's campaign themes. ''There's an interesting relationship between me and the media,'' Mr. Bush told the employees at the company, Marconi Communications. ''I need them to get my message out, and sometimes it comes out fairly and sometimes, frankly, I don't care for the coverage. But that's O.K. Sometimes I answer the question, they think its O.K. Sometimes I answer the questions, they don't like it.''"]
["us", "Today, it was Mr. Bush and his staff who did not like the questions. As the plane headed to St. Louis, Ms. Hughes served reporters cubes of cheese as she called the article about the rats reference ''the cheesiest story'' she had ever read. For the first time since his loss in the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Bush has had to endure a sustained period of bad news, reported by many of the people he says he respects. The recent events range in significance from his failed effort to impose his own plan for debates to smaller gaffes and strategic miscues that have become frequent distractions. The campaign and the reporters who follow it say there has been no perceptible deterioration in their relationship. Indeed, some in the traveling press corps report a kind of admiration for Mr. Bush's resilience. ''He can get pummeled by reporters,'' said David Gregory, a correspondent for NBC News assigned to the campaign. ''And 10 minutes later, he'll come back and shake hands.'' Still, some political professionals wonder whether the trouble Mr. Bush has faced recently will force a shift in the relationship between the governor and the journalists. ''The press is the most jealous mistress of all,'' Mr. Warfield said. ''And Bush has been very smart in recognizing the demands of the care and feeding of the press. The question is how he continues that, now that he's hit a rough patch.''"]
["us", "Mr. Warfield said that Mr. Dole, who as a senator was known for his quick wit, found the tenor of the coverage in the presidential race frustrating. ''He enjoyed bantering with reporters, but his dry sense of humor didn't always translate into ink,'' Mr. Warfield explained. In one instance, Mr. Dole was asked the fairly innocuous question, What was the one thing he wanted Americans to know about him?, Mr. Warfield recalled. ''Senator Dole sort of scratched his head and said 'Beats me,' in a funny way.'' The resulting story? ''Dole can't come up with a single thing he wants America to know about him.'' ''There came a certain reluctance to step on your message of the day by taking the high risk of shooting the breeze with reporters,'' Mr. Warfield said. Some reporters following Mr. Bush say that on some days, the themes and issues the campaign emphasizes, especially health care and education, are retreads that force them to pursue other story lines. And ever more often, the story of the day is what the latest polls are saying. Mr. Bush's decision to visit this state, previously thought to be safely in his column, itself became the dominant story on Monday, when the governor was in Clearwater and West Palm Beach, talking about health care. For example, the lead paragraph in The Palm Beach Post's front page story on Mr. Bush's noted that Mr. Bush's campaign here was ''nowhere near the sure thing he hoped it would be.''"]
["us", "Whether all the ''avails'' are to any avail may be incalculable. Much of what happens is beyond the control of a campaign anyway, said Mr. Shapiro of USA Today, who traveled with the campaign last week. ''A drop in the polls is something that nothing can cushion,'' he said. ''An embarrassing admission is something that nothing can cushion. So all these things are at the margins.'' And Mr. Shapiro said he thought the campaign and the press had reached an acceptable equilibrium. ''It's not chummy 'We're all in this together' nor is it 'You're all part of an evil media conspiracy,' '' Mr. Shapiro said. ''It's much more 'You have your job to do, and we'll help you.' Anything closer, you'd get suspicious.''"]

Guggenheim Museum last week originated at the Tate Modern in London and traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in D\u00fcsseldorf. But in New York, the artist\u2019s grid and stripe compositions take on a whole new life, in part because Martin lived in Lower Manhattan and in part because of the cylindrical Frank Lloyd Wright building that surrounds them. That is the view of the Guggenheim\u2019s Tracey Bashkoff, who organized the exhibition with Tiffany Bell. That is a perspective shared by the New York Times critic Holland Cotter, who wrote that the exhibition\u2019s chronological journey up through the rotunda is its own reward. \u201cBy the time you reach these images on the Guggenheim\u2019s top ramp, under its great skylight, you\u2019ve been through a life,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand had a lesson in what abstraction can be and can do.\u201d Walking through the show a few days before it opened \u2014 as workers put the finishing touches on lighting \u2014 Ms. Bashkoff talked about how the shape of the Guggenheim affects the experience of seeing the exhibition. She also discussed the ways in which the works that line the walls illustrate the artist\u2019s techniques and reflect her professional evolution; they include the final ink drawing Martin made even after she had vowed to retire. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation."]
["arts/design", "IT\u2019S HOW YOU LOOK AT IT The works change so much depending on your physical relationship to the piece. You can see the wavering of her hand or the pencil marks that she left behind. The building plays with that. You can walk into the bays and have a more intimate experience with the work or look across the ramp and get a more sweeping view. AGNES MARTIN 2.0 There are 20 works we added for New York, like the gold \u201cFriendship\u201d It is in MoMA\u2019s collection. It was in London but did not travel to D\u00fcsseldorf or Los Angeles. We wanted to include it because it is a unique and beautiful example from 1963 when Martin was working with the grid in a more elaborate manner. We have also integrated her works on paper with her paintings. In her practice, she went back and forth. INVENTION AND SELF-CRITICISM She experiments with materials, found objects \u2014 like a domino board, knobs from dressers or kitchen cabinets. She was always a fierce editor of her work. She spoke of burning her paintings at the end of every year during the early part of her career, and there are descriptions of her throwing works into a bonfire before she left New York in 1967. ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE Even though Martin\u2019s work shared some of the vocabulary of Minimalism \u2013 grids, repetition \u2014 she didn\u2019t consider herself a minimalist, believing that her paintings had emotional content. She wanted to convey universal states. Her paintings were all about the positive."]
["arts/design", "KEEPING IT CHRONOLOGICAL We start with works she did in the early \u201950s, before she lived for a period in New York. She turns to painting when she\u2019s 30, after doing a little of everything \u2014 teaching, going to school. At first, she paints portraits, landscapes, still lifes. Then the works become more abstract and biomorphic. THE ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISTS She meets Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Richard Diebenkorn. She was born in 1912, the same year as Jackson Pollock. Her work is more akin to Ab-Ex. The artist\u2019s hand is always there. She lived in Ellsworth Kelly\u2019s building; James Rosenquist lived there, too. Robert Indiana was also in the neighborhood \u2014 Jack Youngerman, Lenore Tawney, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg lived nearby. You see connections to those artists. ANOTHER CHAPTER Her last major show was at the Whitney, in 1992. But she lived years after that. She died in 2004. There was a whole body of work that wasn\u2019t shown. Also, during Martin\u2019s lifetime, she didn\u2019t show her earliest abstract canvases (biomorphic works). This retrospective is the first time the early abstractions and last works have been brought together. THE IMPORTANCE OF SANTA FE She abruptly stops painting and leaves New York in 1967. Her loft was being destroyed. She didn\u2019t want to move uptown. Ad Reinhardt died around then. She had bouts of schizophrenia. The pressure of fame, and what that might do to her, affected her working process. She needed to be alone."]
["arts/design", "WATCHING PAINT DRY I\u2019ve learned quite a lot about her technique, how fast the paint dries in the Southwest. Martin painted with oils until 1964, when she moved to acrylic. When she returned to painting she continued to use acrylic, which dries faster than oil. In the heat of the Southwest, perhaps even more so. This speaks to her skill as a painter \u2014 creating uninterrupted bands of color, using thin layers of fast drying paint. She painted the works on the wall, vertically, even if the finished canvas had horizontal stripes, in order to control the drips. FREED BY LIMITS She goes into gray paintings for a long while. She talks about freeing her mind from intellect to receive inspiration. There was variation in the limited vocabulary she imposed on herself, this endless variation. She looks to capture that in the seriality of her work. She did mathematical calculation to see where the stripes would go. A FINAL BURST She was going to retire and moved into assisted living. Within weeks, she found a place for her studio, reduced the size of her canvases to 60 by 60 inches and continued painting. Her last work was one of a handful in her studio when she passed away.

What if all this suburban anger toward President Trump still couldn\u2019t unseat Republicans in the New York suburbs? On Wednesday, after a nearly clean sweep of races from Long Island to northern New Jersey, doubt among local Democrats had been replaced wholesale by optimism. Now nearly nothing is off the table in the 2018 midterm elections. Republican congressional seats once thought to be almost unassailable are now being examined for signs of vulnerability, with their ties to Trump-backed policies a telling guide. In New York, Democrats have focused on unseating six Republican members of the congressional delegation, with an emphasis on Representatives Chris Collins of western New York and Tom Reed, who represents a large portion of the Southern Tier, for their support of the Republican tax plan that would do away with the deduction for state and local taxes. In New Jersey, the northern suburbs have traditionally been Republican, and are key bases of support for Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance. With Philip D. Murphy\u2019s victory in the race for governor on Tuesday, however, that support began to fracture: Mr. Murphy outperformed expectations in the region, Republican incumbents were ousted and candidates in otherwise fairly safe districts had some of the closest elections of their careers."]
["nyregion", "And in Albany, the election results heightened pressure to dismantle the Independent Democratic Conference, the coalition of rogue Democrats who have partnered with Senate Republicans to help give them control of that chamber, despite the Democrats\u2019 numerical majority. But, one perennial question remained: How much capital would Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City invest in those efforts? Mr. Cuomo has long talked of the need for unity among Democrats in the state Capitol, but has also had a history of working with Republicans and the Independent Democratic Conference. Mr. de Blasio has been more overt about trying to elect fellow Democrats in Albany: In 2014, he actively maneuvered to unseat Senate Republicans, though his initiative backfired when his fund-raising efforts to aid Democrats in those races led to federal and state investigations. On Wednesday, the governor seemed more focused on Republicans in Congress than state lawmakers. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see an even greater turnout against what the Republicans are doing next year by Democrats and Republicans and Independents,\u201d he predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very good year.

["nyregion", "The outcomes of what pollsters are calling a \u201cblue wave\u201d were striking. In Morris County, N.J., a Republican stronghold, Mr. Murphy received 45 percent of the vote. In 2009, Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, received 30 percent of the vote. At the local level, Democrats picked up seats in the largely Republican town of Parsippany. In Westchester County, where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one, the two-term Republican incumbent, Rob Astorino, was trounced by a progressive state senator, George Latimer, who became only the third Democrat to hold the top job since the 1930s. The story was the same in Nassau County, where Democrats have only a slight edge over Republicans in voter registration rolls. The Democratic candidate, Laura Curran, a county legislator and former journalist, defeated a former Republican state senator, Jack Martins. Ms. Curran became the first woman and only the third Democrat to hold the county executive\u2019s office. Republican leaders in New York and elsewhere around the region did their best to throw water on the Democratic prognostications. Scott Reif, the spokesman for the State Senate Republicans, said, \u201cWe fully expect to grow our majority by winning seats in 2018,\u201d as was the case in the election for governor in 2014. Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime political consultant, said the Democratic victory was especially noteworthy since Mr. Astorino, who had challenged Mr. Cuomo in 2014, had statewide name recognition. He said the results boded well for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election next year, as well as for Democrats vying for the State Legislature."]
["nyregion", "For political insiders like Mr. Sheinkopf, some of the more local races \u201cwere more instructive about what\u2019s going to happen\u201d next year.

She became the first Democratic town supervisor in a century. Whether the victories will translate into a more sweeping turnover next year of congressional seats in upstate New York, which is staunchly Republican, is unclear. John Del Cecato, a media consultant for Ms. Curran, said that \u201cin many ways Nassau County represents the kind of districts that Democrats need to win nationally to take back the House.\u201d It was also uncertain what the election results portended for the Independent Democratic Conference. Some Democrats have criticized Mr. Cuomo for working closely with Republicans during budget negotiations and not doing enough to broker peace among Senate Democrats. But on Wednesday, Candice Giove, a spokeswoman for the conference, said, \u201cWe are Democrats and we will work to elect Democrats.\u201d And Mr. Cuomo again bristled at the suggestion that he was in any way responsible for Democratic disunity. \u201cLook, I have met with everyone.

He played in the final three games of the series, recording an assist in each. The No. 1 goalie, Matt Murray, was injured in warm-ups before Game 1 of the first round, but is now available to back up the veteran Marc-Andre Fleury, who has reassumed control of the Pittsburgh net with stellar play through much of this postseason. Center Evgeni Malkin tops the leader board in postseason points, with 18, and the rookie wing Jake Guentzel has been a revelation with nine goals. Like Pittsburgh, Ottawa has a player who is arguably the best at his position leading the way and playing through injury. Defenseman Erik Karlsson has been the Senators\u2019 motor all season, and in the playoffs he has 13 points in 12 games, and has contributed sound defensive play and created tempo. He has done so with two stress fractures in his foot and a target on his back. Karlsson, who has averaged nearly 29 minutes per game, may have a stronger bid than Malkin for the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs\u2019 most valuable player."]
["sports/hockey", "Ottawa\u2019s Jean-Gabriel Pageau emerged in similar fashion to Guentzel. Pageau\u2019s four-goal outburst stole Game 2 against the Rangers, and he has seven goals in the playoffs after scoring only 12 in the regular season. Coach Guy Boucher has pushed the right buttons even when his distinct 1-3-1 defensive structure and goaltender Craig Anderson have shown some vulnerability. The Senators\u2019 penalty-killing has been outstanding, and they have had to deploy it liberally. The Senators won two of the three regular-season matchups against Pittsburgh. The Penguins\u2019 injuries on defense have overextended their blue-liners, and it showed in Games 5 and 6 against Washington. Similarly, Ottawa can ill afford to have Karlsson out of its lineup, as he has been central to virtually every victory. Pittsburgh has received balanced scoring from Malkin, Crosby, Guentzel and Phil Kessel. Ottawa will need to even out the play of its forward group against a Penguins lineup that is unlikely to lose any game by 1-0.

What to watch: With an impressive 2-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday, the Ducks snapped their streak of five straight Game 7 losses, four in the past four seasons.

Anaheim\u2019s defense corps is young but has been poised and effective through much of the playoffs. John Gibson, 23, weathered the ups and downs of a wild series against Edmonton and now looks to take a step toward establishing himself as an elite goaltender. Nashville\u2019s Pekka Rinne is an elite goaltender and has been the fulcrum of the Predators\u2019 impressive 8-2 playoff run. He has posted a 1.37 goals-against average and a .951 save percentage.

Subban and Mattias Ekholm have posted a combined rating of plus-24 in the playoffs while contributing 27 points.

The Predators may need solid contributions up front from James Neal, Colin Wilson and Craig Smith, who have been less productive so far. The Ducks won two of the three regular-season meetings between the teams, but last year Nashville ended Anaheim\u2019s season with a first-round upset. On paper, the Ducks have an advantage at forward, while the Predators are stronger on defense and in goal.

["well/eat", "Do Pesticides Get Into the Flesh of Fruits and Vegetables? - The New York Times Q. Do pesticides get into the flesh of conventional fruits and vegetables like cantaloupe, apples and cucumbers? A. Pesticides sprayed on fruits and vegetables accumulate on the outer peel or skin, but the skin does not form an impermeable barrier, and some pesticides are actually designed to be absorbed into the tissue of the fruit or vegetable to protect it from pests that penetrate the skin to suck out the liquid inside Thicker peels may be more effective at keeping pesticides out of the flesh of some fruits like cantaloupe, said Lili He, an assistant professor in food science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studied the best methods for washing chemical pesticide residues off apples. If you\u2019re trying to prioritize which fruits and vegetables to buy organic, check the Environmental Working Group\u2019s list of the so-called \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d and the \u201cClean Fifteen,\u201d as well as Consumer Reports\u2019 Always Buy Organic list. Both make recommendations based on tests of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables, done by the United States Department of Agriculture after the produce has been washed. Cantaloupe is on the \u201cClean Fifteen\u201d list, meaning it has relatively low levels of pesticide residues. Apples, on the other hand, are on the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d meaning they\u2019re high in pesticides, ranking fourth most contaminated after strawberries, spinach and nectarines. Cucumbers barely escaped the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d ranking 13th from the top for pesticide residues."]
["well/eat", "If you buy conventional apples, wash them in a solution of baking soda and water. A recent study by Dr. He, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, found baking soda solution was more effective than either plain water or a bleach solution at removing pesticide residues from the surface of the peels, but the fruit had to be immersed for up to 15 minutes before being rinsed. Even then, washing didn\u2019t remove pesticide residues that had penetrated deep into the peel or through the peel to the flesh of the fruit. Peeling might be effective, the researchers said, but would involve a loss of the nutrients in the skin. Cucumbers and apples are both covered by a natural protective layer of wax, but once pesticides diffuse through that layer, rinsing them off becomes harder, said Dr. Jeffrey Jenkins, director of the National Pesticide Information Center. And when distributors apply yet another layer of wax to these fruits and vegetables to preserve them for shipping, he said, \u201cthat kind of seals in the residues, and all the washing in the world probably isn\u2019t going to have much effect on removing them.\u201d Do you have a health question?

["us", "Waste From Ebola Poses Challenge to Hospitals - The New York Times When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured the public this month that most American hospitals could treat cases of Ebola, it was technically correct. Hospitals routinely treat highly contagious diseases, and top-tier ones are extensively equipped to isolate patients who pose special risks. But the infection over the past week of two Texas hospital workers betrayed what even many of the best hospitals lack: the ability to handle the tide of infectious waste that Ebola generates. Ebola\u2019s catastrophic course includes diarrhea, vomiting and hemorrhaging of blood, a combination difficult enough to contain in less-communicable illnesses. When they are highly contagious, disposing of the waste and cleaning up what is left behind require expertise and equipment that some specialists said are lacking even in highly regarded medical facilities. Those shortcomings are compounded, they said, by surprising gaps in scientists\u2019 knowledge about the Ebola virus itself, down to the time it can survive in different environments outside the body. \u201cThe time for educating on these things is not when we\u2019re in the midst of a crisis,\u201d Paul D. Roepe, the co-director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe time was years ago. Even with the billions we\u2019ve spent preparing our health systems for this sort of scenario, we\u2019re still so open to error.\u201d"]
["us", "A handful of medical centers nationwide, including ones at Emory University and the University of Nebraska that treated the first Ebola cases in this country, are specially equipped and their staff members trained to address the challenges. But they are the exceptions. Most hospitals do not have incinerators or the steam sterilizers called autoclaves with the capacity to handle large amounts of infectious waste. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the 866-bed facility in Dallas where two nurses became ill after treating an Ebola patient, has had to pack and ship 55-gallon drums of waste \u2014 from body fluids to linens to contaminated protective suits to an entire hospital bed \u2014 to a Port Arthur, Tex., incinerator for disposal. The federal Department of Transportation, which regulates hazardous waste shipments, was forced to issue special permits to move waste from the hospital and an Ebola victim\u2019s apartment because the agency\u2019s packaging requirements were not designed for such large volumes of highly infectious material. Perhaps more important, some specialists said, is the lack of training and practice that hospital workers need to treat Ebola victims and safely handle the waste they produce. Debra Sharpe, a Birmingham, Ala., biosafety expert, has overseen safety at a nonprofit laboratory that researches emerging diseases and bioweapons, and has run a company that trained workers to handle biological agents. The infectious waste problems in those jobs parallel those in hospital settings, she said in an interview."]

It\u2019s ludicrous to expect doctors and nurses to figure that out with a day\u2019s worth of training. \u201cNone of the science is new; none of the protection components are new. It\u2019s just new in a health care setting. Hospitals and the C.D.C. should have been reaching out to the biosafety community before now, to try to adjust to this.\u201d The C.D.C. does have general guidelines for handling Ebola waste and a question-and-answer web page with some occasionally unexpected recommendations \u2014 for instance, that infectious body wastes can be safely flushed into public sewer lines. (Ms. Sharpe concurred with this, but added that many treatment facilities, as a precaution, pour bleach into a toilet and wait several minutes before flushing.) Beyond the advisories, gray areas complicate waste problems. Because Ebola is such a messy illness, patients\u2019 rooms must be scrupulously cleaned lest a stray drop of blood or vomit spread virus to an unknowing patient or worker. But the cleaning itself is so hazardous that it, too, requires special training and a knowledge of which hospital sterilizers and cleaners are likely to kill the virus. In Dallas, hospital officials summoned a private hazardous waste cleanup firm to sterilize the room where Thomas Eric Duncan, the nation\u2019s first Ebola victim, died last week. Some 140 55-gallon drums of potentially contaminated material were also hauled from the Dallas apartment where he had stayed."]

["nyregion", "For Police Departments, in City and Elsewhere, Court Oversight Is Not New - The New York Times There was no ambiguity about where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood on having a federal monitor oversee any portion of the New York Police Department. \u201cThis makes no sense whatsoever when lives are on the line to try to change the rules and hamper the police,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said in June. \u201cYou have to have clear responsibility, clear chains of command.\u201d Yet dealing with federal court oversight is not a novel experience for the city or the department. In 1985, the department submitted to a court settlement giving a federal judge authority to oversee its investigations of political activity. The strictures of that oversight have changed over time, and were loosened substantially after the Sept. 11 attacks, but remain in place. The Fire Department, called a \u201cstubborn bastion of white male privilege\u201d by a federal judge, has for the last three years been under the supervision of either a court-appointed monitor or a special master, charged with helping to carry out a plan to hire more minority firefighters. That is just a small fraction of the time that the city\u2019s Department of Correction has been under court supervision: a judge in the early 1970s ordered that the Tombs, the complex near Manhattan Criminal Court where inmates were held, be shut down because of abysmal conditions. When inmates were sent to Rikers Island, they sued over the conditions there. The resulting settlement led to a consent decree in the late 1970s that has kept Rikers Island under court supervision ever since."]
["nyregion", "Even mundane procedures often are vetted by the courts. For example, a federal judge\u2019s order late last year dealt with how frequently light bulbs had to be changed at Rikers, to ensure inmates had enough light to read by. Elsewhere across the country, a number of police departments have found themselves under federal court oversight, often in response to a broader range of alleged police misconduct than in the New York case. In Seattle, for instance, a monitor was brought in to address the incidence of discriminatory and baseless street stops of the public \u2014 the core complaint in the New York City case \u2014 as well as widespread problems with excessive force, particularly the use of batons and flashlights, often against people with mental illness. Typically, judges rely on monitors or other court-appointed officials to ensure that the police are actually following the court-ordered changes. Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis, for instance, described the monitor he put in place for the New York Fire Department as his \u201ceyes and ears.\u201d \u201cAs someone with approximately 500 cases on his docket and a demanding trial schedule,\u201d Judge Garaufis said in an interview, \u201cit\u2019s more efficient to utilize a monitor to hold follow-up teleconferences and meetings with attorneys for the city and the U.S. Justice Department concerning implementation of my remedial order.\u201d In cases elsewhere with monitors for the police, the roles have varied."]

In rare circumstances, judges have permitted monitors or other officials they put in place to take a larger degree of operational control over a police department. In Oakland, Calif., for instance, where the Police Department submitted to federal court oversight about a decade ago, a federal judge has been dissatisfied with the department\u2019s progress. Last year, the judge named a compliance director, in addition to a monitor, and granted him broad authority to, in effect, run the department. Thomas Frazier, the compliance director, is a former Baltimore police chief. He has the power to impose policies as well as to promote and demote officers. But legal experts say the Oakland case, which began with a lawsuit over the behavior of a group of rogue officers known as the Riders, is unusual. They also say that the ways courts have used monitors to oversee the police elsewhere may hold few lessons for New York, because most cities agreed to a monitor as a condition for settling a lawsuit or an investigation by the Justice Department. In New York, however, lawyers for the city have resisted the imposition of a monitor."]

["arts/music", "Review: \u2018De Materie,\u2019 of Matter, Spirit and Sheep - The New York Times Surely this is the first opera production to include 100 sheep among its performers. Heiner Goebbels\u2019s staging of Louis Andriessen\u2019s \u201cDe Materie,\u201d which originated in 2014 in Germany, arrived in the vast Drill Hall of the Park Avenue Armory on Tuesday, with dozens of sheep from the Pennsylvania countryside in its cast. If using live farm animals sounds gimmicky, it was actually a charming, even profound aspect to an audaciously imaginative production. Completed by Mr. Andriessen, the Dutch Modernist master, in 1988 and first staged the next year, \u201cDe Materie\u201d (\u201cMatter\u201d) resists categorization. It\u2019s a philosophical opera in four scenes; an anti-symphonic ultra-symphony; a theatrical spectacle; a piece blithely combining text, dance and singing; or all of the above. When Lincoln Center presented a concert performance of \u201cDe Materie\u201d at Alice Tully Hall in 2004, I found Mr. Andriessen\u2019s eclectic, nearly two-hour score riveting. It deftly combines seemingly incongruous elements: brassy Modernist tweaks on big-band jazz; choral writing that hints at both Renaissance modal styles and the Swingle Singers; undulant riffs of the Steve Reich sort; and passing evocations of everything from Bach to boogie-woogie. But thematically, \u201cDe Materie\u201d seemed frustratingly vague, no less than an exploration of the relationship between matter and spirit, using texts ranging from the 16th-century Dutch declaration of independence from Spain to excerpts from Marie Curie\u2019s diaries."]
["arts/music", "But Mr. Goebbels\u2019s inspired production brings out the philosophical resonances that run through the work and revels in its literary crosscurrents. And this performance \u2014 featuring two fine solo singers; the impressive eight-member Chorwerk Ruhr; a roster of dancers; and the brilliant International Contemporary Ensemble, expanded with extra players \u2014 was colorful, exciting and, during reflective episodes, raptly beautiful. Peter Rundel was the assured conductor. Opera fans and theater audiences have had some experience with works that eschew linear narratives, like \u201cEinstein on the Beach.\u201d But compositions that also involve overlapping texts and themes, like \u201cDe Materie,\u201d are rarer and often discombobulating. This piece opens with a bang, 144 of them to be exact: endless iterations of a pummeling chord in the orchestra, which this score weights heavily with brass, winds, percussion and synthesizers. The chords begin at a steady pace but soon grow nervous and speed up. The ensemble finally erupts into gnashing agitation. Then the choir of eight men and women (here costumed as if out of Dutch old master paintings) sing a setting of the document of Dutch independence, rendered in block declamatory chords. This segues into a similarly chordal setting of detailed Dutch shipbuilding instructions from the 17th century. Soon a solo tenor (Pascal Charbonneau) portraying Gorlaeus, a pioneering atomic theorist who died in 1612, sings urgent, clarion phrases explaining that matter consists of infinitesimally small particles."]
["arts/music", "Mr. Goebbels\u2019s stage in this first part is dominated by big white tents, under which we eventually see the shadows of workers building the parts of a ship. The music explodes at one point with sounds of hammers, like a hammering fugue. The thematic meaning comes through vividly, as staged and performed here: The parts of the ship are fused into an entity, just as atomic particles make up all matter. Part 2, the slow movement of this operatic symphony, features a soprano (Evgeniya Sotnikova) singing with warmth and tenderness as Hadewijch, a 13th-century Dutch mystic nun and poet. In ravishing music, thick with shimmering orchestral harmonies, calmly oscillating figures and long, expansive vocal phrases, she sings of an ecstatic vision of Christ. In the intensity of her craving to \u201cknow and taste him,\u201d Hadewijch imagines a connection more profound than normal human attachments. The synthesis she seeks is almost akin to atomic particle bonding. The Dutch painter Piet Mondrian is the subject of Part 3, which could be the scherzo of \u201cDe Materie.\u201d Its simple, ingenious scenic element involves illuminated circles that change colors, dangling from three-piece metal bars that bend and move and even seem to dance, suggesting Mondrian\u2019s geometric images. The chorus sings texts by the Dutch mathematician M. H. J. Schoenmaekers about the purity of a straight line. The music becomes alive with jazzy intensity and bursts of boogie-woogie, though filtered through hard-edged Modernist harmonies, as a roster of dancers led by two men take over the stage."]
["arts/music", "Our sheep friends arrive in Part 4, as the chorus sings phrases from dreamy sonnets by the Dutch poet Willem Kloos. At first, the orchestral music unfolds with alternating chords, bright yet ominous, packed with pitches, yet somehow lucid. On Tuesday the sheep, almost as if directed to do so, moved slowly, huddling and hovering in a circle, like particles spinning within an atom. And their occasional bleating lent a lovely natural touch to the score. A final scene has Curie (here Catherine Milliken, a dancer), appearing before a gathering of scientist colleagues, speaking excerpts from her Nobel Prize acceptance speech, alternated with passages from her diary that pay tribute to her dead husband. Though affecting, the scene seemed too realistic in the context of such an experimental work. That\u2019s a small reservation. The Park Avenue Armory, once again taking advantage of its awesome space, is offering a powerful performance of Mr. Andriessen\u2019s arresting piece, however you want to classify it."]

Donald Fehr, the executive director of the players union, said the league\u2019s offer meant that instead of the owners taking \u201can extraordinarily large amount\u201d of money from the players, it was trying to take merely \u201ca really big amount.\u201d Bettman\u2019s proposal was in response to the union\u2019s offer, which he said was \u201cnot much different\u201d from its previous offer, \u201cwhich we indicated was not acceptable.\u201d More than 250 players convened in Manhattan on Wednesday for a briefing on the negotiations and their options in the event of a lockout. One option included playing overseas, which close to 400 players did during the last lockout, in 2004-5. The first lockout came in 1994-95. Bettman and Fehr exchanged proposals during a two-and-a-half hour bargaining session at the league office, their first formal talks since Aug. 31.

The union estimated that the players\u2019 share under the offer started at 49 percent and ended at 47 percent over the course of a six-year deal. Under the expiring collective bargaining agreement, the players get 57 percent of league revenue. Fehr said the union\u2019s latest offer for a five-year deal lowered the players\u2019 share to 54.3 percent of revenue the first year, and dropped as low as 52 percent before finishing at 54 percent. \u201cWe hope that a dialogue will arise out of this that will push us the rest of the way to try to reach an agreement,\u201d Fehr said, but it seems highly unlikely that a lockout can be averted. Some players indicated they might play overseas. Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins has said he may play for his hometown team in Russia, Metallurg Magnitogorsk.

In other developments, the players union and 16 Montreal Canadiens players filed a motion Wednesday with the Quebec Labor Relations Board to have a lockout declared illegal under the province\u2019s labor laws. A hearing will be held Friday morning. The players contend that they cannot be locked out because the players\u2019 association is not certified as a union in Quebec. If their motion is successful, the Canadiens would have to pay their players and, possibly, allow them to return to work.

Holder Jr., were powerful signals that the pendulum has swung away from the tough-on-crime policies of a generation ago. Critics have long contended that draconian mandatory minimum sentence laws for low-level drug offenses, as well as stop-and-frisk police policies that target higher-crime and minority neighborhoods, have a disproportionate impact on members of minority groups. On Monday, Mr. Holder announced that federal prosecutors would no longer invoke the sentencing laws, and a judge found that stop-and-frisk practices in New York were unconstitutional racial profiling. While the timing was a coincidence, Barbara Arnwine, the president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that the effect was \u201chistoric, groundbreaking, and potentially game-changing.\u201d \u201cI thought that the most important significance of both events was the sense of enough is enough,\u201d said Ms. Arnwine, who attended the speech in San Francisco where Mr. Holder unveiled the new Justice Department policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling that this is the moment to make needed change. This just can\u2019t continue, this level of extreme heightened injustice in our policing, our law enforcement and our criminal justice system.\u201d"]
["us", "A generation ago, amid a crack epidemic, state and federal lawmakers enacted a wave of tough-on-crime measures that resulted in an 800 percent increase in the number of prisoners in the United States, even as the population grew by only a third. The spike in prisoners centered on an increase in the number of African-American and Hispanic men convicted of drug crimes; blacks are about six times as likely as whites to be incarcerated. But the crack wave has long since passed and violent crime rates have plummeted to four-decade lows, in the process reducing crime as a salient political issue. Traditionally conservative states, driven by a need to save money on building and maintaining prisons, have taken the lead in scaling back policies of mass incarceration. Against that backdrop, the move away from mandatory sentences and Judge Shira A. Scheindlin\u2019s ruling on stop-and-frisk practices signaled that a course correction on two big criminal justice issues that disproportionately affect minorities has finally been made, according to the advocates who have pushed for those changes. \u201cI think that there is a sea change now of thinking around the impact of over-incarceration and selective enforcement in our criminal justice system on racial minorities,\u201d said Vanita Gupta of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThese are hugely significant and symbolic events, because we would not have either of these even five years ago.\u201d"]

But not everyone was celebrating. William G. Otis, a former federal prosecutor and an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School, described Mr. Holder\u2019s move as a victory for drug dealers that would incentivize greater sales of addictive contraband, and he suggested that the stop-and-frisk ruling could be overturned on appeal. Mr. Otis also warned that society was becoming \u201ccomplacent\u201d and forgetting that the drug and sentencing policies enacted over the last three decades had contributed to the falling crime rates. Yet Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group, said many police chiefs agreed that it was time to rethink mandatory sentencing for low-level drug offenses.

Those critics cite the low rate of finding guns with stop-and-frisk actions, and say that the experience of being searched \u2014 and the consequences if drugs are discovered \u2014 alienate people in targeted communities, making them less willing to give the police information about more serious violent crimes. \u201cThere was the thought that if we stop, frisk, arrest and incarcerate huge numbers of people, that will reduce crime,\u201d Rudovsky said. \u201cBut while that may have had some effect on crime, the negative parts outweighed the positive parts.\u201d Critics have argued that aggressive policing in minority neighborhoods can distort overall crime statistics.

Apple Watch \u201cis a computing platform, but that\u2019s really the wrong way to approach this category from the very beginning.\u201d An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. Indisputably, Fitbit is growing, both in staff and sales. At the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a timeline on the wall in the fifth-floor hallway illustrates the firm\u2019s history. In 2007, when Mr. Park, a Harvard dropout who had worked on photo-sharing software, founded Fitbit with his business partner Eric N. Friedman, who is now Fitbit\u2019s chief of technology, the start-up had just two employees. By 2015, it had 1,101. Inside the offices, furnished in midcentury modern style, employees are constantly shuffling in and out of conference rooms for meetings. On a recent visit, a group of new hires was touring the headquarters."]
["technology", "Still, a concern among investors is whether Fitbit can extract more money from existing customers. Most of its sales are from people who buy Fitbit devices for the first time, not those who upgrade. In addition, many people may end up leaving their Fitbit devices in a drawer. Of those who bought a Fitbit device in 2015, 28 percent stopped using it by the end of the year, according to the company. \u201cThat means that many people who buy Fitbits don\u2019t use them for long, and presumably aren\u2019t going to buy another Fitbit device,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThey have to constantly find new people to sell Fitbits to, whereas most consumer electronics companies can rely on a good amount of repeat business.\u201d Addressing some of these concerns falls partly to Woody Scal, Fitbit\u2019s chief business officer, who oversees sales and marketing for the company. Last year, Fitbit acquired FitStar, which makes apps offering video instructions on workouts. The apps charge a monthly subscription fee for access to exercise programs, an example of how Fitbit could eventually collect money from software services. But it may be a while before FitStar has an impact on Fitbit\u2019s results; earlier last month, the FitStar app was ranked 157th in the health and fitness category of Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, a research firm. Fitbit said FitStar had accumulated 3.5 million downloads and has a loyal user base."]
["technology", "The big picture for Fitbit, Mr. Scal said, is its evolution into a digital monitoring platform to discover and prevent health problems. Fitbit has teamed up with corporations that offer wellness programs for employees. BP, for example, offers Fitbits to more than 23,000 employees, partly to ensure they are getting enough sleep before they work on oil rigs. Mr. Scal said the data from sleep monitoring, a feature built in to all Fitbit devices, could lead to new health revelations. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve tracked more nights of sleep than have ever been tracked in the history of man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can actually now compare it to normative data that we have and we can identify irregularities.\u201d As for Apple, though Mr. Park said he was not bothered by the rival company, it has long been in his sights. When Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011, for example, Mr. Park had a realization. At the time, the new iPhone added a capability to synchronize with wireless accessories using the standard called Bluetooth. Fitbit trackers back then lacked Bluetooth connectivity, but Mr. Park wanted them to be able to synchronize data immediately with the iPhone. \u201cIt could enable a lot of possibilities in terms of real-time feedback,\u201d he said. So Mr. Park gathered a few top employees into a conference room. They decided to re-engineer the Fitbit products to support the new feature. The decision set product releases back about six months, but the revised devices became best sellers."]
["technology", "Mr. Park said Fitbit was poised to innovate products to stay competitive. Sensors are getting more sophisticated, so he imagined a situation where high-end Fitbit devices could eventually support mobile payments or control smart home products like Internet-connected light bulbs. Yet the products will stop short of resembling the Apple Watch. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful with how we include these things over time,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cI think one of the general knocks against smartwatches is that people still don\u2019t know what they\u2019re good for, so they\u2019ve crammed everything in.\u201d"]
["washington", "High Court, 5-4, Affirms Right to Abortion But Allows Most of Pennsylvania's Limits - The New York Times WASHINGTON, June 29 By the narrowest of margins, and in words reflecting anger and anguish alike at its continuing role in the center of the storm over abortion, the Supreme Court today reaffirmed what it called the \"essence\" of the constitutional right to abortion while at the same time permitting some new state restrictions. The 5-to-4 ruling redefined and limited the abortion right to some degree. But it left it stronger than many abortion-rights supporters had expected and opponents had hoped for from a Court that had appeared for the last three years to be on a course leading inevitably to the evisceration, if not complete overruling, of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established abortion as a fundamental right. [ Excerpts from the decision, page A16. ] Unconstitutional Prohibitions While the ruling upheld part of a Pennsylvania law regulating access to abortions, the majority left no doubt that laws prohibiting all or most abortions are unconstitutional. Louisiana, Utah and Guam have passed such laws and other states have been considering them. In the opinion for the Court, unusual for being written jointly by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter, and joined in part by Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, the majority said that Roe v. Wade established a \"rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.\""]
["washington", "The majority said the 1973 decision had acquired a \"rare precedential force\" and could be overturned \"under fire\" only \"at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy, and to the nation's commitment to the rule of law.\" There was little doubt that the \"under fire\" comment was aimed, at least in part, at the White House, both under President Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. In the first paragraph of its 60-page opinion, the majority noted pointedly that \"the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule Roe.\" A New Analysis The decision upheld parts of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act and struck down another part, applying for the first time a new analysis that asks whether a state abortion regulation has the purpose or effect of imposing an \"undue burden.\" This was defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" Under this analysis, the Court said that four sections of Pennsylvania's law did not impose an undue burden on the right to abortion and were constitutional. These sections require a woman to delay an abortion for 24 hours after listening to a presentation at the medical office intended to persuade them to change her mind; require teen-agers to have the consent of one parent or a judge; specify the medical emergencies in which the other requirements will be waived, and require the doctor or clinic to make statistical reports to the state. At the same time, by a 5-4 vote, the Court struck down a fifth provision requiring a married woman to tell her husband of her intent to have an abortion."]
["washington", "Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat whose opposition to abortion has made him something of a pariah in his party, said the Court's analysis vindicated his state's approach to regulating abortion. \"Today's decision upholding the Pennsylvania law is a victory for the unborn child, the most powerless member of the human family,\" he said. Abortion-rights supporters said the ruling would encourage more state restrictions and that the waiting period, in particular, would make abortions more difficult and expensive for women who would have to make two trips to abortion clinics that might be hundreds of miles from their homes. Seven Justices supported these requirements. In addition to Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter, they were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Byron R. White and Clarence Thomas. These four Justices said that the Court should not only have upheld these regulations, but should also have overturned Roe v. Wade itself. Justices Blackmun and Stevens, in separate opinions of their own, said that four provisions should be held unconstitutional. And they joined the O'Connor-Kennedy-Souter group to strike down the husband-notification provision. This provision contained several exceptions, including one for women who believed their husbands would physically injure them on learning of a planned abortion. But the Court said that this did not sufficiently protect women who face psychological as well as physical abuse and who may have \"very good reasons for not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion.\""]
["washington", "The Court added, \"A state may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his wife that parents exercise over their children.\" Scathing Dissents In dissenting opinions, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia offered scathing critiques of the Court's opinion. Each signed the other's opinion, and both opinions were also signed by Justices White and Thomas. The overlap was somewhat puzzling, because the two opinions expressed very different, even contradictory, views about what the majority had accomplished. Chief Justice Rehnquist said the Court had not actually reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, but had rendered it a \"facade,\" replacing its framework with a standard \"created largely out of whole cloth\" and \"not built to last.\" \"Roe v. Wade stands as a sort of judicial Potemkin village,\" the Chief Justice said, \"which may be pointed out to passersby as a monument to the importance of adhering to precedent.\" Justice Scalia, on the other hand, declared that \"the imperial judiciary lives,\" and appeared to concede to the majority its assertion that abortion remained on a solid constitutional foundation, although one he strongly disagreed with. \"By foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouse,\" Justice Scalia said, \"by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish.\""]
["washington", "The case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, No. 91-744, gave the two newest Justices their first opportunity to rule in an abortion case. Both Bush nominees -- Justice Souter, who joined the Court in 1990, and Justice Thomas, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee last September that he had never discussed Roe v. Wade -- had been careful to avoid giving their views on abortion during their confirmation hearings. Surprise from 2 Justices The real surprise in the decision, however, lay not in their votes but in the votes of two Justices chosen by Ronald Reagan, Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, who in previous opinions were sharp critics of Roe v. Wade. Just three years ago, when the Court upheld portions of a restrictive Missouri abortion law in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, Justice Kennedy joined a plurality opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist that would have essentially overturned Roe v. Wade and replaced it with the lowest level of constitutional protection. Justice O'Connor was a consistent dissenter during her early years on the Court. In her first abortion opinion in 1983, she was sharply critical of the precedent, declaring that it had established a doctrine \"at war with itself\" because the date of fetal viability was, she said, moving ever earlier toward the first months of pregnancy."]
["washington", "In her early opinions, Justice O'Connor proposed replacing Roe v. Wade with an \"undue burden\" test that would have allowed more restrictions than the test she, Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter adopted today. Because she had initially referred to the state's interest in the life of the fetus as \"compelling,\" it had not been clear whether her original \"undue burden\" test would find it unconstitutional for a state to ban abortion. Today's opinion made no reference to a \"compelling\" state interest in fetal life and acknowledged that some of her previous statements had been \"inconsistent.\" \"We answer the question, left open in previous opinions discussing the undue burden formulation, whether a law designed to further the state's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability could be constitutional,\" the three Justices wrote. \"The answer is no.\" The important difference between today's decision and Roe v. Wade lay in the standard of review by which courts are to evaluate abortion restrictions. As the Court had interpreted Roe v. Wade until the Webster decision three years ago, abortion was a \"fundamental\" right that could not be restricted except to serve a \"compelling\" state interest, a standard of review known as \"strict scrutiny\" under which nearly all restrictions on abortion during the first two trimesters of pregnancy were found invalid."]
["washington", "But the new \"undue burden\" standard will permit considerably more regulation during that period. The Court today overruled two decisions, one from 1983 and the other from 1986, that had struck down, applying strict scrutiny analysis, 24-hour waiting periods and informed consent provisions much like the ones the Court upheld today. The decision today upheld a ruling last fall by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia. More Wrangling Ahead The decision today was certainly not the Court's final word on the abortion issue, and it may not even be the final word on the Pennsylvania law. The majority indicated that because the law had not yet taken effect, and because the abortion clinics that challenged the law had not had occasion to document the effects of the waiting period and other provisions, the Court's door would be open to the argument that provisions that did not appear to impose an \"undue burden\" in theory might do so in fact. Justice Blackmun, in his separate opinion, said he was \"pleased\" that the Court was open to reconsidering its conclusion and \"confident\" that the evidence would prove the clinics' case. The opinion of Justice Blackmun, the author of Roe v. Wade, took an extraordinarily personal tone, reflecting relief that the Court had not flatly overturned Roe v. Wade as he had publicly predicted, and disappointment that his legacy still remained under attack."]
["washington", "In a bitter dissenting opinion in the Webster case three years ago, he warned that darkness was approaching and \"a chill wind blows.\" Today, he said, \"But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright.\" He commended Justices O'Connor, Souter and Kennedy for \"an act of personal courage and constitutional principle.\" But he warned that Roe v. Wade was only one vote away from being completely overruled. \"I am 83 years old,\" he said. \"I cannot remain on this Court forever.\" He predicted a fierce confirmation battle over the nomination of a successor. Justice Blackmun, the oldest member of the Court, has said within the past few days that he is not planning to retire at this point. Given the Justices' personal feelings, the scene in the courtroom this morning, on the last day of the Court's term, was one of drama. Justice O'Connor read a section of the joint opinion, stressing that abortion was a difficult personal issue for the members of the Court. But she said, \"Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\""]
["technology", "Lyft to Develop Self-Driving Car Technology in New Silicon Valley Facility - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Controlling the future of the smartphone was the defining technology battle of the last decade. Now, technology companies are betting that the next 10 years and beyond will be spent battling for control of the self-driving automobile. On Friday, Lyft, the ride-hailing company, announced that it was developing its own self-driving technology, marking yet another company\u2019s gamble that the future of transportation will be marked by self-driving cars. Lyft is marking the occasion with the opening of a new self-driving-research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to heavily recruit new engineering and technical people for the facility after it opens in the coming weeks. \u201cWe aren\u2019t thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. It\u2019s core to our business,\u201d said Luc Vincent, vice president of autonomous technology at Lyft. \u201cThat\u2019s why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to grow that team in the months ahead.\u201d Uber, Lyft\u2019s much larger rival, has spent millions opening facilities in Pittsburgh, Toronto and San Francisco dedicated entirely to autonomous-vehicle research, while building its own hardware and software systems to operate the vehicles. And many other companies, from Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit in Silicon Valley to major auto manufacturers in Detroit and Europe, are also working on autonomous-driving technology."]
["technology", "Lyft is taking a markedly different approach from Uber. While Uber\u2019s self-driving plans have mostly been a solo effort, Lyft has announced what it calls its Open Platform Initiative, a way to develop autonomous vehicle technology in conjunction with automakers and technology companies. \u201cWe want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think there\u2019s a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it,\u201d said Raj Kapoor, Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer, in a press event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. Perhaps the best way to understand the initiative is through the lens of the smartphone. Uber\u2019s approach is closer to that of Apple: Both companies want to control most of the product, whether the software or the hardware. Lyft, in contrast, is acting a bit more like Google in its development of the Android operating system. Both companies are creating software that many different hardware manufacturers can use, while developing the technology collaboratively with hardware partners. In Lyft\u2019s ideal world, that could mean a quicker spread of Lyft\u2019s technology among automakers. Automakers are scrambling to develop their own self-driving technology as they imagine how they might operate in a future in which fewer people own cars. Collaborating with Lyft could help bring that technology to market faster, while automakers could provide Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing network with more cars to serve riders."]
["technology", "Lyft is seeing early signs of traction. Early partners include Waymo, nuTonomy, Jaguar, Land Rover and General Motors. The public details of the partnerships are scant, but all of the companies have committed to working together to make self-driving cars commonplace. There are potential drawbacks. Partners could decide to leave the Open Platform Initiative and develop their own software. Or companies could be wary of teaming up with Lyft because it is developing its own self-driving system. Lyft executives believe that the self-driving-car race is in its early days, and that companies that may consider one another rivals still have much to gain from collaborating and learning while building the automobile fleets of the future. \u201cLyft is not getting into the business of manufacturing a car,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to creating a self-driving system.

["sports/baseball", "Yankees\u2019 Nine Straight Hits Off Price Add Up to One Big Victory - The New York Times DETROIT \u2014  Nine batters kept going around and around the bases, 90 feet at a time for the most part, dropping in hits against one of the best pitchers in baseball. Generating hits and runs has been a persistent challenge this year for the Yankees, who ranked 12th in the 15-team American League in hits entering Wednesday\u2019s game against David Price and the Detroit Tigers, with a lineup that generally bears no resemblance to the Bronx Bombers of the past. But in a conga line of an inning that defied all expectations, that lineup became a juggernaut, hammering out nine consecutive hits and eight runs on what appeared to be a loop tape and paving the way for an 8-4 victory. It was as if the entire team were taking a round of batting practice. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d said the Yankees\u2019 hitting coach, Kevin Long, who watched proudly from the bench. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You always say, \u2018Everyone get a hit,\u2019 but they literally did it.\u201d That the onslaught happened against Price, who was 10-5 against the Yankees in his career going into the game, was all the more remarkable. Price had not given up nine hits in any of his last 14 starts, dating to June 4, when he allowed nine in seven and one-third innings. In his last three starts, he had allowed a combined nine hits, and his batting average against this season was .227, the sixth-lowest mark in the A.L."]
["sports/baseball", "But in the third inning, the Yankees batted 1.000 against him. They now trail division-leading Baltimore by six games and are two and a half behind Seattle for the second wild-card spot. While Price, the 2012 A.L. Cy Young Award winner, had perhaps his worst outing, Yankees starter Shane Greene pitched marvelously once again. He allowed two runs and eight hits and struck out eight to raise his record to 4-1. The Yankees have won in each of his last five starts. Price started well, too, striking out the side in the first. He gave up a couple of hits in the second, but the Yankees did not score. Then came the haunting third. The eight runs were the most the Yankees had scored in one inning all season. The only Yankee who did not score in the inning was Francisco Cervelli, the No. 9 hitter. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the last A.L. team to collect hits in nine straight plate appearances was the Tigers, against the Toronto Blue Jays in 1996. St. Louis did it against Pittsburgh last year. Most of the Yankees, like Long, said they had not seen anything like it. \u201cMaybe in a Little League game,\u201d Manager Joe Girardi said. \u201cSometimes it just happens. The game doesn\u2019t always make sense.\u201d It all began innocently enough when Jacoby Ellsbury, the first batter of the inning, singled to right. Derek Jeter followed with a run-scoring double to right, which was followed by a single to left by Martin Prado. The fourth hit came off the bat of Mark Teixeira, who doubled into the right-field corner and pushed home Jeter."]
["sports/baseball", "That elicited a visit from the Tigers\u2019 pitching coach, Jeff Jones, if only to give Price a breather. It did not work. Carlos Beltran singled off the wall in right field to score Prado, and Brian McCann\u2019s flare landed safely in center field. \u201cReally, we were just going base to base,\u201d Beltran said. By that point, Price was trying to suppress his frustration, but there was more to come. Chase Headley, the seventh batter, rapped out the seventh hit, a ground ball through the hole on the left side of the infield, and Brett Gardner reached on a soft bouncer to the shortstop, Eugenio Suarez, who had no play, for the eighth hit. Finally, Cervelli put the last touch on the canvas, another ground-ball single for the team\u2019s ninth consecutive hit. It was not as if the Yankees had thrashed Price, exactly, other than the two doubles and Beltran\u2019s ball off the wall, but the sheer volume was staggering. Mercifully, Manager Brad Ausmus took Price out of the game, and there were no more hits. Still, the next two batters had productive plate appearances. Ellsbury and Jeter both hit sacrifice fly balls off Blaine Hardy, and the Yankees had an eight-run lead. The last out, a grounder to third by Prado, came on the 12th plate appearance of the inning and was the only one that did not result in a hit or a run. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d Jeter said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t see that very often.\u201d INSIDE PITCH"]

["sports/football", "Florida State Settles Suit Over Jameis Winston Rape Inquiry - The New York Times Florida State University agreed on Monday to pay $950,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former student who accused the former Seminoles football star Jameis Winston of raping her in 2012. The settlement also commits Florida State to five years of sexual assault awareness programs and to the publishing of annual reports on those programs, although the university did not admit liability. Winston was never criminally charged in the case, in part, the local prosecutor acknowledged, because a number of shortcomings in the police investigation left him without the evidence needed to sustain a charge of rape. Because of the publicity it generated, the Winston case became a centerpiece for a national debate over two intertwined issues: how universities handle allegations of sexual assault, and whether colleges and the police afford special treatment to athletes accused of misconduct. A New York Times examination \u2014 based on police and university records, as well as interviews with people close to the case, including lawyers and sexual assault experts \u2014 found that Florida State and the Tallahassee police had done little to determine what happened in the Winston case. In a statement announcing Monday\u2019s settlement, the Florida State president, John Thrasher, said the university had determined that fighting the suit would have cost millions of dollars and that avoiding a trial was thus a financially responsible decision \u201ceven though we are convinced that we would have prevailed.\u201d"]

Ms. Kinsman\u2019s lawyers noted that the settlement of the lawsuit against Florida State did not affect a separate lawsuit she has filed accusing Mr. Winston of sexual battery. Ms. Kinsman accused Mr. Winston, the former Florida State quarterback, of raping her in December 2012. Both were students at Florida State at the time, although Mr. Winston had yet to play football for the Seminoles.

The suit asserted that university administrators, in apparent violation of federal law, did not promptly investigate either the rape accusation or a witness\u2019s admission that he had recorded part of the encounter on video. In fact, the examination by The Times found that there had been virtually no investigation at all. The Tallahassee police did not follow obvious leads that would have quickly identified a suspect as well as witnesses, including the one who made the video recording. After the accuser identified Mr. Winston as her assailant, the police did not try to interview him for nearly two weeks or to obtain his DNA. The detective handling the case waited two months to write his first report and then prematurely suspended his inquiry without informing the accuser. By the time the prosecutor got the case, important evidence had disappeared, including the video of the sexual act. The Times\u2019s reporting also yielded a fuller account of how Florida State handled the rape complaint against Mr. Winston. In January 2013, days after Mr. Winston was identified by his accuser, senior Florida State athletic officials met privately with Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer. Afterward, they decided, on behalf of the university, not to begin an internal disciplinary inquiry, as required by federal law.

Bacsinszky often dominated rallies with her backhand and gutted out a lengthy first set in 65 minutes. The second set, although the same score, was 21 minutes shorter. The French Open has been the site of the most pivotal moments of Bacsinszky\u2019s career. In 2013, Bacsinszky had given up on tennis because of injuries and lingering resentments about how her father had forced her into the sport, and was working toward a degree in hotel management. But after receiving an automated email from the French Open informing her that her ranking had still earned her a spot in qualifying, she drove from her home in Switzerland to Paris, and her career was renewed."]

There are many things, many influences in your tennis career. But when you\u2019re over there, you just enjoy the moment. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I told myself today, as well: Just enjoy it; you\u2019re privileged.

Ostapenko was far more clipped, usually answering questions in about 30 words."]
["sports/tennis", "The pointed responses matched her assertive play. The 19-year-old Ostapenko, ranked 47th, had never reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam. But she dominated a former No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki \u2014 seeded 11th here \u2014 in a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 win on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Ostapenko found herself in a 5-0 hole early, as heavy winds threw her aggressive shots awry and Wozniacki played more cautiously. \u201cIn the first set, she was missing,\u201d Wozniacki said, \u201cbut then she started hitting it a few inches from the line the whole time.\u201d And that led Ostapenko to dominate the next two sets; she finished with 38 winners to Wozniacki\u2019s six. It was Ostapenko\u2019s third win this season over Wozniacki, one of the game\u2019s premier defenders. \u201cShe\u2019s playing really well, and she\u2019s very consistent,\u201d Ostapenko said of Wozniacki. \u201cIn my mind, every time I go on court to play against her, I just know that I have to stay aggressive, but to not go for every shot because I have to be consistent as well.\u201d Ostapenko won the 2014 Wimbledon junior title at 17, an achievement that validated an initially difficult choice: the tennis court or the dance floor? \u201cI did ballroom dancing and tennis at the same time, but my results in tennis were much better,\u201d Ostapenko said. \u201cI was still good, but I think I enjoyed tennis a little bit more, and I was better at tennis. Yeah, I won a couple of tournaments in juniors, and then I won the junior Wimbledon, so I think that kind of showed that I can probably play pretty well.\u201d"]
["sports/tennis", "Ostapenko had participated in ballroom dancing competitions in her native Latvia, and continues to practice it as a way of cross-training. Her favorite dance, she said, is the samba. \u201cIn ballroom dancing, you also have to be very fit and very strong,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I do my ballroom dancing practice, I get more tired than when I do my tennis practice or fitness practice. It\u2019s really tough, and it\u2019s really good for the footwork as well. There are small steps, and I think it\u2019s very helpful.\u201d Ostapenko said one of the decisive factors in choosing tennis was that it was an individual sport. Ballroom dancing requires a talented and steady partner, something she had trouble maintaining while also devoting herself to tennis. \u201cThe hardest part was to find a good partner, because many things depend on your partner,\u201d she said. \u201cThere, in Latvia, there were not that many dancers of the guys. Because I was doing tennis and ballroom dancing at the same time, in summer they went somewhere for dance camp, and I couldn\u2019t go because I still had to practice my tennis practices. Every time I didn\u2019t go, after the camp I got pretty bad partners.\u201d Tennis, especially with her commanding playing style, causes no such problems. \u201cEverything depends only on me,\u201d she said."]

["business", "United and Continental Agree to $3 Billion Merger - The New York Times United Airlines and Continental Airlines agreed Sunday to a $3 billion merger that would create the world\u2019s biggest airline, according to people briefed on the negotiations. The deal, to be announced officially on Monday, would form a coast-to-coast behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, along with an extended network to Asia, Latin America and Europe. The deal was completed in a remarkably swift three weeks, and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low-cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad. United is buying Continental, and the combined company will  keep the United name and be based in Chicago. Jeffery A. Smisek, Continental\u2019s chief executive, would run the company. If the deal wins antitrust approval, the merged airline would replace Delta Air Lines as the top carrier. The boards of both companies met Sunday to approve the all-stock deal, according to people familiar with the companies who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were delicate. The UAL Corporation, United\u2019s parent company, would issue 1.05 shares for each Continental share, valuing the acquisition at $3.17 billion, based on Friday\u2019s closing price. The merger is expected to be completed before the end of the year."]
["business", "For consumers, the merger could eventually result in higher prices. Though the new company does not intend to raise fares, according to the people briefed on the matter, one of the rationales for airline mergers is to cut capacity. That reduces the number of seats in the industry and allows airlines to increase fares. In addition, United and Continental will no longer be competing against each other on some routes, allowing them to save money but offering travelers fewer options. \u201cAirlines are struggling to find a business model that makes sense,\u201d said Scott Sonenshein, an assistant professor at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University. \u201cConsolidation gives them more leverage. As a consumer, you will have less choices, fewer routes, higher prices and more fees.\u201d Still, in the last decade fares have declined because of pressure from low-fare airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, as well as lower passenger demand. As a result, previous mergers have had a muted effect on ticket prices, especially on routes served by low-fare carriers. Even with the steep cuts  made in the last two years, airlines are still losing money, with too many seats chasing too few passengers. For much of the last decade they have suffered a succession of powerful blows \u2014 from the terrorist attacks of 9/11  to rapidly rising fuel costs and the recession. They have also been straining to keep up with low-fare competition."]
["business", "But  with the economy starting to improve and passenger traffic picking up, the industry is generally healthier now, with more cash and less debt. Credit markets have also thawed, allowing access to capital. Combined, United and Continental have 21 percent of domestic capacity, in terms of so-called available seat miles, or one seat flown one mile. Delta has a market share of 20 percent. Globally, the merged companies would  have a 7 percent market share. The merger would put pressure on American Airlines, which was once the market leader, but which would drop to third place. While American\u2019s executives say they do not feel threatened by industry mergers, Wall Street analysts have been displeased by the company\u2019s performance. US Airways, which three weeks ago began its own merger talks with United, is now left on the sidelines, raising questions about its ability to survive as a stand-alone carrier. The United-Continental deal has some major hurdles to clear. The airlines need to win approval from the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, a challenge given the renewed regulatory zeal in Washington. Unlike the Bush administration\u2019s six-month review of the Delta-Northwest deal, analysts expect a lengthier and more complex review of this merger. The merger also needs the backing of employee unions, whose opposition to mergers in the past has undone many of the proposed savings. One factor in favor of the deal is that United\u2019s pilots\u2019 union indicated last month it would not oppose a deal with Continental, whose own pilots have so far remained silent."]
["business", "The board approvals end nearly a month of intrigue after United initiated talks to combine with US Airways. Those negotiations caught Continental executives by surprise, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Many analysts said United\u2019s talks with US Airways were intended all along to lure Continental to the table. United and Continental were close to a merger two years ago, but Continental walked away because of United\u2019s poor financial health. The earlier talks allowed for swift negotiations this time. United and Continental executives quickly settled some potentially divisive issues, like the name of the combined company, where its headquarters would be and who would run it. United\u2019s chairman, Glenn F. Tilton, would remain for two years. After that, Mr. Smisek of Continental would become the executive chairman. The Chicago connection could provide additional benefits. Mr. Tilton has been courting local politicians, and the city is eager to retain a major business. United now could use that leverage with the Obama administration, whose ties to Chicago run deep. United shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined company, with Continental shareholders owning the rest. Management would be roughly split between the sides. The new entity would expect annual cost savings of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and would still fly to 370 cities in 59 countries. The combined airlines would have a 40 percent market share at San Francisco International  and 35 percent at Chicago O\u2019Hare International, according to data compiled by Cambridge Aviation Research, a consulting company. At Houston Intercontinental, one of the city\u2019s two airports, they would have 64 percent of the market and at Newark Liberty International, 55 percent."]
["business", "A merger could yield more than $2 billion in additional revenue and cost savings, according to estimates by Vicki Bryan, an analyst at Gimme Credit. The deal is a personal success for Mr. Tilton, a former oil executive who ran the Texaco Corporation until it was acquired by Chevron. He took over United in 2002 as it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and has since pushed relentlessly for a merger. It also vindicates the work of Kathryn A. Mikells, United\u2019s chief financial officer since November 2008, who is the highest-ranking woman in an industry dominated by men. Analysts have praised her for United\u2019s cost-cutting efforts in the last year, Jeff Straebler, a strategist at RBS Securities, said. United\u2019s improved finances have allowed for a major turnaround in its fortunes. In 2008, it was Continental that was close to buying United. But as that deal was being negotiated, United reported steeper-than-expected losses, leading to doubts about the company\u2019s health even as soaring oil prices were crippling the entire industry. Just hours before a deal was to be announced, Continental executives walked away. But in the last two years, United has improved its cash position, aggressively reduced capacity,  raised new revenue from bag and other fees, and cut costs. It now has $4.5 billion in cash."]

The conflict has escalated into the worst East-West confrontation since the Cold War, and the developments on the ground in the rebellious east along the Russian border suggested it would worsen. Mr. Poroshenko scrapped a trip to Turkey to deal with the crisis and called an emergency meeting of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council. He dismissed Kremlin claims that any Russian soldiers in Ukraine were volunteers who had sacrificed their vacations to help the heavily pro-Russian east suffering oppression from the Kiev central government. \u201cColumns of heavy artillery, huge loads of arms and regular Russian servicemen came to the territory of Ukraine from Russia through the uncontrolled border area,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said.

While the United States and its European allies have condemned Russia, they have not responded to criticism that the Ukrainian tactics against the separatists have included shelling civilian areas in rebel strongholds.

Usually the issue is how to stop the spread of the most problematic of the different species, or figure out why the sting is so painful. But scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology, including Zhongyang Liu and David Hu, were interested in the ways that a mass \u2014 or you might say, a mess \u2014 of fire ants can act like a fluid or a solid, depending on the situation. It\u2019s the first time this duality had been observed in a group of living things. In a presentation at a meeting of the American Physical Society last month the researchers showed video of the ants pouring out of a funnel, like some thick and wriggling syrup, and also springing back into a rough ball shape after being pressed down. These images illustrated the findings of the more technical research, done with rheometers to measure the precise viscosity and elasticity of balls of ants under stress. The researchers found that in different situations the ants behaved differently. To flow, they moved around, rearranging themselves in the group, acting like a thick fluid. When the aggregation struggled to keep its shape, the ants clung to each other, acting like an elastic solid \u2014 rubber for example."]
["science", "The research could have practical implications, Dr. Hu said, for self-assembling robots, which build themselves out of smaller bits and for self-healing materials.

For years, Democrats counted older Americans among their most unwavering supporters. They assumed that those voters would never abandon the party that created Social Security and Medicare. But these days, most older voters remember Ronald Reagan far better than they do Franklin D. Roosevelt, and it is no longer safe to assume that voters who are 60 and older will reflexively back Democrats. ''Seniors are, absolutely, up for grabs,'' said John Rother, the chief lobbyist for AARP, the largest advocacy group for older Americans. ''The parties are paying more attention than ever to the senior vote. There's a recognition that neither side can take it for granted.'' That recognition is underscored by a statistic that was obscured by the postelection hostilities in Florida last fall. After Al Gore made ''saving Social Security'' his battle cry (and after his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, spent so much time in Florida retirement colonies he might as well have lived there), George W. Bush defeated Mr. Gore among Floridians 65 and older by 52 to 46 percent, according to exit polls. Given Mr. Bush's overall margin of victory, it can fairly be said that Florida's older voters handed him the presidency."]
["business", "One reason Republicans were successful was that they were not timid about seeking support from elderly Floridians -- among other things, inundating them with telephone recordings from Barbara Bush. The results have emboldened Republicans to do more of the same in 2002. ''The message we've walked away with, at least in Republican circles in Florida,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, ''is that when there was such a focus on seniors all the way through, we were able to battle over seniors to a victory.'' Not all the news for Democrats was bad. In four states where Mr. Bush lost narrowly -- Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington -- Mr. Gore edged him out among older voters. In the nation over all, Mr. Gore got 51 percent and Mr. Bush got 47 percent of the 60-and-over vote, compared with a 48-48 split among all voters, the exit polls found. Mr. Gore did particularly well among older women. But in 1992, Bill Clinton did fully seven percentage points better among older voters than he did among voters as a whole. Except for the Ronald Reagan landslide of 1984, Democrats carried the 60-and-older vote in House races from 1980 through 1992. Since then, Republicans have largely prevailed among older voters. ''Senior citizen issues will be in play continuously from one election to another from here on out, as opposed to the past when they've only come to the fore periodically,'' said Robert H. Binstock, a professor of aging, health and society at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. ''There will be this great concern not to let the other party get a jump -- and to try to get a jump yourself.''"]
["business", "By the mid-2030's, some analysts predict, people 60 and older could account for one-third of the electorate. (In the 2000 presidential campaign, those voters made up 22 percent of the total vote.) But Professor Binstock, among other experts, warned that older Americans were by no means a monolith driven only by age-related interests and programs like Social Security and Medicare. For example, older women were far more likely to vote Democratic in last year's elections than older men were. While this is also true for women in general, older women may have an additional reason for voting Democratic: because they are far less economically secure than older men, they may be more responsive to Democrats' promises to protect government benefits. Still, it is clear that older voters as a whole are less reliably Democratic than they once were, and strategists and academics cite many explanations. One is shifting demographics. The ranks of the New Deal generation are thinning. There is also more economic diversity among older voters; well-off people are more apt to embrace Republican economic proposals. ''The people who remember where Medicare and Social Security came from are not there anymore,'' said Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York. ''Certainly they're still voting in large numbers. But we don't have the solid Democratic vote that we used to have.'' During the health care debate in 1993-94, Ms. Slaughter said, retired Democrats were particularly susceptible to direct-mail solicitations that were intended to prey on their fears. ''I was amazed at the number of people who didn't realize Medicare was a government program,'' she said."]
["business", "Democrats also lost ground, analysts say, because Mr. Bush had some success in neutralizing Mr. Gore's appeal on issues like prescription drug benefits and Medicare and Social Security overhaul. Gov. John M. Engler, a Republican from Michigan, said that it was safer than it used to be for Republicans to raise the prospect of tinkering with Social Security, including investing some of its funds in private accounts. ''An awful lot of seniors worry about their children and grandchildren,'' he said. ''You can make some headway.'' Another reason for the Republican gains, at least in this election, pollsters say, was older Americans' sensitivity to issues of morality and values. Many presumably took out their anger with Mr. Clinton on his vice president. ''We've got to work on the issue of trust, of values, of morals,'' said Representative Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, adding that his party must convince voters ''that Democrats are as pro-family as Republicans.'' Mr. Udall said that in his re-election drive last year, he put a special focus on older voters. ''I really emphasized prescription drugs efforts and H.M.O. reforms, and spent a lot of time in senior centers and nursing homes,'' he said. While Republicans are more and more hopeful about attracting older voters now that their party controls the White House and Congress, they may have difficulty persuading some of those voters who are wary of Mr. Bush's tax cuts and his proposals to overhaul Medicare and Social Security."]

They compared them with people hospitalized in the same cities, on the same days of the week, in the five weeks before and after the races. The study is in The New England Journal of Medicine.

And yet there was a reminder, at last week\u2019s International CES trade show in Las Vegas, of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten 3-D goggles to their faces. At a news conference, Intel, the chip maker, provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a 3-D video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits. Intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone, in case anybody felt inclined to vomit, an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people. Laura Anderson, an Intel spokeswoman, said the company had provided the bags \u201cout of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience.\u201d No one used the bags, she said. It is time for a reality check for virtual reality, one of the most hyped technologies of last year. Sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates, held back by high costs, a lack of must-have content, and the complexity and awkwardness of the products. Less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better, but are far more limited in what they can do."]
["business", "Many technologists and early adopters of virtual reality remain unchanged in their conviction that the technology will eventually change how entertainment, including games and movies, is experienced by the masses. The major virtual reality headsets from Oculus, HTC and Sony went on sale to the public only last year, and those who thought they would find a large audience within months of release had unrealistic expectations, virtual reality\u2019s advocates say. \u201cThis is going to be a long slog, as the technology continues to improve, more content becomes available and awareness increases,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research. Virtual reality now appears to be headed for a phase in the evolution of new technologies known as the \u201ctrough of disillusionment,\u201d said Sunny Dhillon, a venture capitalist at Signia Venture Partners, which has invested in virtual reality start-ups. According to the technology research firm Gartner, this stage of the hype cycle for new technologies comes after a period of inflated expectations, but before a phase in which their benefits become commonly accepted. The excitement around virtual reality took a huge leap in March 2014 when Facebook announced it planned to acquire Oculus for $2 billion and the social network\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, suggested that virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology after mobile. That deal sparked a wave of start-ups creating products for virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality, which overlays digital imagery on a view of the real world, as seen through smartphones and headsets. Last year, $1.48 billion was invested in start-ups in that category, compared with $331 million the prior year, estimated Pitchbook, a financial data firm."]
["business", "Many of those start-ups were funded before major headsets went on sale to the public. Entrepreneurs raising money in the future are likely to encounter tougher questions about what kind of use their products are getting. \u201cAll the major headsets have launched \u2014 the numbers are coming in,\u201d said Alex Rosenfeld, the founder of Vrideo, a start-up that acted as a YouTube-like hub for virtual reality videos. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some companies here that don\u2019t survive. If the industry is going to continue to attract dollars, there\u2019s going to have to be real numbers.\u201d Vrideo was one of those that did not make it. Mr. Rosenfeld announced at the end of November that he was shutting the company down. He said investors were skeptical about whether Vrideo could compete against larger players like Google\u2019s YouTube and Facebook not pessimistic about the overall future of virtual reality. The companies that make the major headsets do not report their sales, and all of them said they were pleased with the results so far. SuperData Research, a technology research firm, estimated that Oculus had sold 360,000 headsets and HTC 450,000 since their products went on sale in March and June, respectively. Both of those headsets require high-end PCs with powerful processors. The firm estimated that Sony, which began selling a virtual reality headset in October, has sold about 750,000. Sony\u2019s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a PlayStation 4 console, more than 53 million of which have already been sold."]
["business", "A bundle with the PlayStation VR headset and specialized controllers sells for $500, while comparable bundles from HTC and Oculus sell for just under $800 each. Less expensive Sony and Oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality. Still, the Sony sales were fewer than SuperData and others had expected. \u201cThe holidays were pretty disappointing for many in the industry,\u201d said Doug Renert, a venture capitalist with Tandem Capital. \u201cI\u2019m not all that surprised.\u201d In a bright spot, Samsung said last week at CES that is had shipped more than five million of its Gear VR headsets, which act as a cradle for a mobile phone, with lenses that create a 3-D image from the phone\u2019s screen. Samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a Samsung smartphone. Price drops on technology are likely to be a big factor in mainstream acceptance of virtual reality. Starting Monday, a company that makes gaming PCs, CyberPower, will begin selling a $499 computer that can play virtual reality content when used with an Oculus headset. That is hundreds of dollars less than the normal cost. Ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome. The more powerful headsets must be tethered by thick cables to PCs or consoles, which can tangle up players\u2019 legs when these rigs occlude their view of the real world."]

In particular, she wrote several insightful pieces on the Baltimore Orioles, who stood apart from every other major-league team in refusing to use replacement players if the strike was not settled. Fay Vincent, who served as the Major League Baseball commissioner for almost three years after the 1989 death of A.

["international/middleeast", "Arafat Says Saudi Plan Needs U.S. Backing - The New York Times RAMALLAH, West Bank, Thursday, Feb. 28 \u2014 Calling a recent Saudi Arabian proposal a \"very strong platform\" for a comprehensive Mideast peace, Yasir Arafat said today that its chances for success depended on immediate American support. \"There must be a very important, and very strong, and very quick push from outside,\" Mr. Arafat said in an interview just after midnight in his battered, darkened compound here, where Israeli forces have confined him for almost three months. Over the past half century, Israel has viewed Mr. Arafat alternately as an enemy, a partner for peace and now, it insists, an irrelevancy. But Mr. Arafat did not dismiss the possibility that Israel would join him in embracing the Saudi plan, noting that several senior Israeli officials have spoken favorably of it. In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in an interview Wednesday that the administration was prepared to pursue aggressively several new openings for peace in the Middle East, but he insisted that the onus for curtailing violence remained on Mr. Arafat. Under the Saudi plan, which was outlined last week by Crown Prince Abdullah and has gathered considerable international interest, Saudi Arabia would lead other Arab states in normalizing relations with Israel in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it occupied in 1967."]
["international/middleeast", "Mr. Arafat's strongest hope seemed to be that the United States would use the Saudi proposals to end 17 months of unrelenting violence here, which he suggested now threatens the region's stability. \"The most important thing is that it is accepted by the Europeans, the Russians and the Americans,\" he said. The critical role, he made clear, was that of the president he called \"Bush the son.\" After recalling the efforts by the first President Bush to convene a Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991, he said he hoped the current President Bush would complete \"this very important historical initiative.\" But he did not specify how he thought the Americans might help. How quickly the goals of the Saudi plan can be attained \"depends no doubt on the Americans,\" he said. He added that he expected the proposal would receive full approval at a summit meeting of the members of the Arab League on March 27 in Beirut. On Tuesday President Bush called Prince Abdullah to express cautious praise for his proposal, saying the United States would welcome a full normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world after a comprehensive peace agreement was reached. Mr. Arafat, who is 72, was alert and lively, by turns humorous and defiant as he reflected on his decades-long rivalry with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his current predicament. Though at times he bitterly criticized Israel's actions, at other moments he insisted that his confinement here did not bother him."]
["international/middleeast", "\"I am an old general,\" he said with an indulgent smile, when asked about three recent Israeli missile strikes within yards of his office. Israel has repeatedly said it has no intention of hurting Mr. Arafat. Mr. Arafat noted with satisfaction recent signs of Israeli dissent, pointing in particular to a letter signed by more than 250 reserve members of the armed forces refusing to serve in the occupied territories. But when asked if he thought Mr. Sharon's coalition government would be split by the Saudi proposal, he said: \"We hope not. We hope all of them will accept it.\" Mr. Arafat pointed out that Mr. Sharon, in his long military and political career, had supported some difficult Israeli concessions for peace, including the withdrawal from Sinai to achieve peace with Egypt. \"He demolished by himself all the settlements\" in Sinai, he said. \"If there's a will, there's a way.\" Holding his usual predawn office hours, Mr. Arafat wore his trademark black and white keffiyeh and olive-drab uniform, his collar decorated with pins showing the Palestinian and American flags and the emblem of the European Union. Two trays of cookies were to his right, and two four-inch stacks of paper lay in front of him. His desk was littered with office supplies and with five Lucite bulbs holding models of the Kaaba, the holiest Muslim shrine in Mecca. Enormous photographs of the Dome of the Rock, the Muslim shrine in Jerusalem, decorated the walls before and behind him."]
["international/middleeast", "Mr. Arafat repeatedly parried questions with his characteristic expression, \"Not to forget.\" \"Not to forget,\" Mr. Arafat said, when it was suggested that the Americans thought he had not done enough to fight violence, \"I didn't send my helicopters and my F-15's and my F-16's and my tanks to any Israeli city. But in spite of that, we are completely committed to the peace of the brave, which we have signed. Not only for us, the peace. The peace is for us, the Palestinians; for them, the Israelis; for the whole Middle East.\" Outside his starkly lit, third-floor office, Mr. Arafat's compound was cast in shadows. A half dozen guards with Kalashnikov rifles stood sentry at the inner and outer gates, two of them warming themselves by a blazing fire set in a steel drum. The Israeli tanks are gone from the positions they occupied for weeks within a hundred yards of the compound. Israel pulled them back on Sunday, after Palestinian security forces arrested three men accused of taking part in the killing of Rehavam Zeevi, the Israeli tourism minister, on Oct. 17. But Israel has said Mr. Arafat remains confined to Ramallah, where he has been since early December. \"This is a big mistake by them,\" Mr. Arafat said, arguing that he had taken the steps Israel demanded as a condition for his release."]
["international/middleeast", "Questioned about Mr. Sharon's recent statement that he regretted Israel's failure to kill Mr. Arafat when it had the chance in Lebanon, Mr. Arafat smiled and said Israel had in fact tried to kill him. \"I have to ask him, Does this help?\" he said of the comment about his death. \"Does it help the peace process?\" \"It seems that he doesn't want to forget 1982,\" Mr. Arafat said. That year, Mr. Sharon, as defense minister, led an invasion of Lebanon to drive the Palestine Liberation Organization away from Israel's northern border. Israeli forces wound up besieging Mr. Arafat in Beirut, much as they are now doing in Ramallah. Asked about his confinement, Mr. Arafat said, \"For me, it's not the first time.\" More important, he said, were the Israeli restrictions faced by average Palestinians, which he described as \"the siege, the reoccupation of liberated Palestinian areas, these checkpoints that you see for yourself.\" \"It's creating a state of explosion,\" he said. He warned that new \"buffer zones\" planned by Mr. Sharon to separate Israelis and Palestinians would turn Palestinian areas into a patchwork of \"Bantustans.\" He said Mr. Sharon was planning a \"Berlin Wall\" around Jerusalem. Many leaders of Mr. Arafat's own faction, Fatah, say Palestinian militants should focus their violence on Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Asked his reaction to a recent attack west of Ramallah that killed six Israeli soldiers, Mr. Arafat said: \"I condemned it completely, and I declared a state of emergency. I took very difficult steps.\""]
["international/middleeast", "He appeared to be referring to measures he took before that, in December, when he called for a halt to all attacks on Israelis. Among such steps, Mr. Arafat noted that he had detained the secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which he called the second biggest faction in the P.L.O., and he said that he had arrested some members of Fatah. He accused Israel of provoking Palestinian violence through its policy of tracking down and killing militants, including from Fatah. One issue Mr. Arafat declined to discuss was a ship smuggling munitions under Palestinian command that Israel intercepted in the Red Sea in January. The Palestinian leader simply waved a hand over one shoulder, as if to say the matter was behind him. When he returned triumphantly to Ramallah seven years ago, Mr. Arafat appeared to be on the cusp of his dream, a state of Palestine. But these days, at least one Israeli official has taken to comparing Mr. Arafat wryly to Moses, saying it is not his destiny to reach his goal. Asked if he believed he would live to see a Palestinian state, Mr. Arafat said, \"No doubt, no doubt.\""]

On global warming and arsenic in drinking water, the two areas in which reversals by the White House have attracted the most criticism, Mrs. Whitman said the administration was working hard to develop better, more balanced policies than those that had been set aside. But in her first address to a major environmental organization, Mrs. Whitman met with considerable skepticism. After she left the podium, the head of the National Wildlife Federation, which has a bipartisan, middle-of-the-road reputation, appealed to her ''to call a truce in what is beginning to look like a war on the environment.'' ''We can't stand idly by and watch what is beginning to look like a cascade of efforts to roll back progress on the environment,'' said Mark Van Putten, the president of the wildlife federation, which had not joined other environmental groups in their criticism of the administration. The tense exchange at a hotel here came as the administration was facing sharper criticism from other environmental groups, one of which has already called for Mrs. Whitman's resignation, and from Congressional Democrats who have urged the White House to reconsider many of its early environmental actions."]

Mrs. Whitman, the former New Jersey governor, had advised the White House against its decision to come out against the Kyoto treaty on global warming. But in her address today, and in comments to reporters afterward, she assumed the role of a committed loyalist, saying she ''obviously'' did not agree with Mr. Van Putten's characterization and offering the most extensive defense to date of the administration's environmental policy making. Mrs. Whitman told reporters that critics had been exaggerating the impact of ''one or two decisions that people might disagree with'' while minimizing others generally seen as more favorable to the environment. One of those decisions left in place a Clinton administration rule forcing drastic reductions in emissions of pollutants by buses and big trucks, even though that action had been opposed by the oil industry. On arsenic, on which the Bush administration abandoned a strict drinking-water standard approved by the Clinton administration, Mrs. Whitman said for the first time that ''there's a very good likelihood'' that  a review now under way might result in a recommendation of an even tougher standard. On global warming, Mrs. Whitman elaborated on earlier defenses of the administration's decisions to set aside the Kyoto treaty and to reverse a campaign promise to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide. Both actions have been criticized within the United States and abroad."]

''But I think you'll agree,'' she said, ''that we are better off moving forward than fighting battles we may have already lost.'' Mrs. Whitman's comment was an allusion to the strong sentiment against the Kyoto accord that the Senate expressed in 1997, even before the treaty was signed. In place of the treaty's approach, which would have required the United States and other industrialized countries to meet strict standards for reductions of emissions of heat-trapping gases, Mrs. Whitman said the administration was seeking to develop an alternative that would emphasize ''technology, market-based incentives and other innovative approaches.'' Outside the room where Mrs. Whitman spoke, the National Wildlife Federation had posted signs calling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska ''too wild to drill,'' a rallying cry in opposition to another administration policy. Mrs. Whitman did not explicitly defend the administration's effort to win Congressional approval for oil drilling in the refuge. But she did express frustration at the difficulty the administration faced in coming up with new supplies of energy. ''Nobody wants to drill for oil because of what that might do to the environment,'' Mrs. Whitman told reporters. ''No one wants oil transmission pipelines because they blow up. No one want to talk about nuclear energy. And even windmills kill birds because they're in the flyway.''

The attack came after 11 p.m. here, precisely as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was meeting President Bush in Washington to discuss ways to move the region out of 18 months of deepening conflict. Almost immediately, Mr. Sharon decided to return home, declaring ''Israel will not surrender to blackmail.'' [Excerpts, Page A14.] The militant Palestinian group Hamas reportedly claimed responsibility for the bombing, which witnesses outside the club said had been carried out by a man carrying a suitcase full of nails and explosives who had been mistaken for a technician. The front windows and walls were blown out and part of the ceiling collapsed. Chunks of glass littered a gas station across the street, more than 120 yards away. The Palestinian Authority of Yasir Arafat was quick to condemn the attack and said it ''will not be light-handed in punishing those who have caused great harm to our cause.''

He vowed that there would be no shelter for terrorists. Mr. Sharon sent Israeli troops in force into Palestinian-ruled areas of the West Bank on March 29, in the largest operation in 20 years, to prevent just this kind of attack, the first of its kind since April 12. Israeli security officials said they had been concerned that the Palestinian militants would try during Mr. Sharon's trip to Washington to show that his effort had been in vain. Uzi Landau, Israel's minister of internal security, who came to the scene of the bombing, called for a tough military response, saying: ''We have to keep fighting. The harder we fight, the fewer attacks there will be.'' The attack was on a club full of people, many of them elderly women, said one survivor, Shlomo Michael, watching as white plastic body bags were brought down from the third-floor Sheffield Club by men on a fire ladder. He said there had been no security guard at the entrance, as required by law, but the police said the club had been operating without permits. The suicide bombing seemed certain to complicate negotiations to end the siege at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where Palestinian militants have sought refuge from Israeli forces since April 2. A deal to end the siege, which would have sent some Palestinians militants to Italy, stalled on Tuesday after Italy said no one had sought its consent."]
["world", "The deal was struck after Mr. Arafat made steep concessions to Israeli demands. But any favor he may have curried was certainly erased by the pool hall attack. Yafa Ben Ari, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that ''Arafat has not answered the call of President Bush to put a stop to terror.'' ''We need to see some concrete action on the ground to show that Arafat has made the strategic choice President Bush has been calling for,'' he said. At the United Nations, Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was appalled by the attack. A statement, issued through his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, called it ''morally repugnant.'' At the same time, the General Assembly voted by a large majority to request that Mr. Annan prepare a report on events last month at the Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin, where Israeli forces leveled hundreds of homes. The scene of the latest suicide bombing was a gambling club on the third and top floor of a concrete building in a commercial zone of this city 10 miles south of Tel Aviv. Rishon le Zion, founded in 1882 by 10 pioneers from Russia, was the first permanent settlement set up in Erez Israel by Zionist immigrants. Today it is a city of about 140,000 people."]

He made 200 shekels on Tuesday night, about $45, he said. ''Dedi, the cashier, asked me why I was leaving so early,'' he recalled. ''I said I'd got my money, and when I was a little way down the street I heard the explosion. Now I want to read the paper and find out which of my friends are alive and which are dead.'' Haim Cohen, a police commander, said the bomber had walked right into the pool hall ''and then he exploded.'' Emergency workers poured into the area along with scores of ambulances, as passers-by gathered to watch. A few chanted ''Death to the Arabs.'' Others were crying. Yehiel Hazan, 53, said he ''heard the explosion, and I immediately understood this is a terror attack. ''People started to shout and panic,'' he said. ''I saw people run out covered in blood. I could see they were burned and injured.'' Ran Rokach told Israeli radio: ''I was driving in the area, and I heard this loud bang. At first I thought this might be gunshots, but when I turned around to see what happened I saw people flying out of the window.'' The suicide bombing was the first in Israel since a young woman detonated herself and killed six other people on April 12 at a Jerusalem market."]

A Hamas spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar, told The Associated Press he could not confirm the claim, but said, ''If it is a martyrdom operation, it means that Israel has lost its war against the Palestinians and the Palestinian resistance has proved that it is capable of reaching the enemy everywhere.''"]
["business/dealbook", "Deutsche Bank Joins Retreat From China - The New York Times Deutsche Bank is joining peers in cashing out of China. The German lender is selling a $3.8 billion, 19.9 percent holding, in Hua Xia Bank to local insurer PICC Property and Casualty. Like such rivals as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch before it, Deutsche Bank is crystallizing a solid return \u2014 while acknowledging that minority stakes on the mainland are of little use. Given China\u2019s troubles, this is a less-than-ideal time to sell. Shares of the bank, which is listed in Shenzhen, trade at just 6.5 times forward earnings, or 0.9 times book value, both roughly one-third below their 10-year average, Thomson Reuters StarMine data shows. But the foray was still worth the effort. In total, Deutsche Bank invested about 1.3 billion euros from 2006 to 2011. The final sale price will depend on how Hua Xia\u2019s shares trade. But at the midpoint of the stated range, \u20ac3.45 billion, plus \u20ac400 million or so of previous dividends, Deutsche Bank will have nearly tripled its money on a gross basis. That is not to be sniffed at, even if taxes on dividends and capital gains will presumably cut the net return significantly. Goldman Sachs made about 3.5 times its money investing in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, albeit over a shorter time frame."]

The German bank is also now off the hook should Hua Xia need shareholders\u2019 help in shoring up its balance sheet. Shareholders will be heartened in other ways, too. Minority positions with little influence, and no prospect of future control, look badly out of place when banks are struggling to make sustainable returns. This holds doubly true given China\u2019s slowdown. The era of Western investment in Chinese banks is not quite over \u2014 HSBC is a notable holdout, firmly committed to its stake in Bank of Communications.

["books", "BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Watching Grass Grow and Men Fight - The New York Times A PAINTED HOUSE By John Grisham 388 pages. Doubleday. $27.95. In John Grisham's pokey 388-page novella about the Arkansas boyhood of 7-year-old Luke Chandler, there is only one faint hint of the lawyer's art. This comes when Luke persuades an unwelcome guest to barricade herself in an outhouse because he has so skillfully exaggerated the danger of a snake attack. Luke does this because the guest is an obnoxious Northerner who corrects the grammar of one of the Chandlers (her own husband!) and says, ''I just can't believe how backward you people are'' about the whole clan. Maybe this should serve as a deterrent to finding fault with ''A Painted House,'' a gently nostalgic tale of childhood and of changing rural America in 1952, but the fact is that Mr. Grisham did not become Mr. Grisham by dawdling in the summer heat. Yet here he is, observing that ''the days dragged on, each yielding ever so slowly to the next'' and even pregnantly ending Chapter 32 with ''We waited for more rain.''"]
["books", "Talk about the weather takes up a disproportionate amount of space in ''A Painted House'' because there is so little else going on. At a leisurely pace that Mr. Grisham's usual readers are liable to find unsettling, the author sets his warmly rustic scene. There is the struggling Chandler farm, presided over by Eli (Pappy) Chandler, who could have been a St. Louis Cardinal but had to give up baseball to work the land. There is Gran, his wife, who practices folk medicine and of course makes the best biscuits around. There are Luke's father, who grew up on the farm, and his mother, whose own house was painted and hence nicer (see title) but does her best to fit in. Her vegetable garden is frequently mentioned. So is the time spent listening to Cardinals games on the radio and shelling peas and butter beans. To harvest their cotton crop, the Chandlers must rely on migrant workers. So during the summer when the book takes place they bring in two groups. There are Mexicans, ''all small and skinny and dirt-poor,'' who are treated with perfect kindness by the Chandlers and described mostly as a generic group. The Mexicans work hard, gratefully accept the finest vegetables from Luke's mother's garden, play baseball with Luke and give him a tortilla. (''It was hot and spicy and messy,'' he reports, typifying the book's descriptive powers.) There is exactly one bad Mexican, and he makes trouble."]
["books", "The hill people, the Spruills, warrant more attention because they provide the book with its scant drama. There is a pretty 17-year-old named Tally on whom Luke gets a crush. There is a disabled boy named Trot, of whom it is said that he ''ain't right.'' And there is a great big thug named Hank, whose first run-in with Luke is rendered with typical delicacy. Just for fun, Hank starts demanding that Luke call him ''sir'' and then announces: ''You farm people are right uppity, you know that? You think you're better than us hill folk 'cause you have this land and 'cause you pay us to work it. Ain't that right, boy?'' Sure enough, with Hank around, somebody gets hurt. And Luke has a terrible secret to keep, but really not much comes of it. After setting up the possibilities of an elaborate turf war at the Chandler place, Mr. Grisham turns out to be uninterested in heavy plotting after all and he pretty much lets it slide. In the last and actually most genuine part of the book, once most of the padding has fallen away and the author seems to feel less need to tread water, he begins allowing real and permanent change to reach the Chandlers and their way of life. Ultimately this book is less about whether the Spruills and the Mexicans will do battle at the Chandler place than whether the Chandlers' innocent way of life can hang on anywhere other than in Luke's memory."]
["books", "Although ''A Painted House'' is said to be inspired by the author's own Arkansas childhood, it is by no means his most believable book. And if somewhere inside this sleepy, meandering collection of rural stereotypes there is buried a beautifully succinct childhood fable like Tony Earley's ''Jim the Boy,'' then it is much too well disguised. Far from tapping into anything real, the author seems intent on delivering an upright and safely predictable past in which his readers can take comfort. When the carnival comes to town, as it must in a book this eager for seasonal distractions, rest assured that ''the Ferris wheel stood in the middle, surrounded by the smaller rides, the booths and the midway.'' ''Shrill music rattled from the loudspeakers on the merry-go-round and the carousel. Long lines of people were already waiting. I could smell popcorn and corn dogs and something frying in grease.'' And because character itself is a sure thing here, Hank will beat up the strongman in the sideshow and make off with his money. In ''A Painted House'' there is way too much fried chicken at the church picnic, and there is a shopkeeper of whom ''it was said that she knew the sound of each truck that passed along Main Street and that she could not only identify the farmer driving it but also could tell how long it had been since he'd been to town.'' There is an admirable decency and simplicity to such details, and they add up to the book's most attractive aspect. Still, when Mr. Grisham provides a meteorological event of near-biblical proportions, it almost comes as a relief. There was much here that was ready to be washed away."]

Spree vs. Iverson at the Garden. Shaq and Kobe, trying to saw in half the Portland timber. Be there, the whole shebang. On some levels, it is the best the N.B.A. can offer today -- genuine rivalries and stars worth paying to see. Yet once you get past the theater on the floor, the real, opening-night story line emerges: Welcome to a another riveting season, where roughly three teams in the West can win the championship,  Elden Campbell is one of the premier big men in the Eastern Conference and Allen Iverson's controversial new CD hits stores in February. You shouldn't hate this game. But you should be worried about it. For instance, call up America Online, click ''Pro Basketball,'' and this is what you get: ''Arbitrator to Decide if Smith's Contract Could Be Voided'' and ''Strickland Charged After Refusing to Leave Restaurant'' sandwiched around ''Utah's Stockton Still Going Strong Entering 17th Season.'' Nowhere can you find a more indicting story about the state of the league than the Joe Smith contract fiasco. Never mind the details, it is really about a ruthless agent who coaxed a frightened owner into signing an under-the-table agreement for . . . a decent role player."]
["sports", "Joe Smith is not Kevin Garnett. Smith may go down as one of the bigger No. 1 pick disappointments of all time, right up there with Pervis Ellison in 1989. But he was somehow worth circumventing the salary cap, breaking the rules, costing Minnesota five No. 1 draft picks, cash and perhaps its competitive future. Then there's Rod Strickland, in some kind of scrape with the law again, charged with refusing to leave a restaurant that was being shut by fire marshals. It may be a misunderstanding. But here is the harsh truth about the Wizards' point guard: One of the most artistic and skilled players of his era is still too stubborn to realize he has just about thrown away what could have been a Hall of Fame career. He was that good. Then you have John Stockton, 38, the pasty-faced point guard with the too-short shorts, plugging along with 37-year-old Karl Malone on the team that time forgot, their success and longevity minimized by the fact that they are both seen as too fundamental (read: boring) to capture a market share anymore. It does not stop there. Iverson releases a hard-core rap single that is misogynistic, homophobic and punctuated by gunshots -- just like his gangsta rap heroes Jay-Z and DMX. He is seen as ''keeping it real,'' not conforming to the N.B.A. that David Stern wants to sell. This is the N.B.A. in which it is O.K. to be hard and from the inner city -- in fact, N.B.A. Entertainment will even cooperate with videos -- as long as you don't bring too much of that life with you to upset the paying white customers."]

These are the people who disturbingly have influence in the N.B.A., who hear about this young kid tearing up the West Fourth Street courts during a summer tournament and immediately sink their teeth in. I watched a very talented 16-year-old play there this summer. His name is Lenny Cook, a 6-foot-7-inch left-handed kid who clearly had the gift. He was named the top newcomer at the annual ABCD camp, one of the premier cattle calls for teenage prospects put on by the longtime sneaker guru Sonny Vaccaro. ''Mr. Sonny calls me all the time now,'' Cook told me after his summer league game. Because Mr. Sonny is an Adidas man, and may be trying to funnel a schoolboy talent toward one of his agent friends who represent Adidas clients. Because if Mr. Sonny does not, Nike will. Cook seemed like a nice, impressionable young kid. Other than punting the basketball over the fence and on top of a neighboring brownstone after his team lost, he looked like a good sport. But he is already immersed in a culture that is telling him he is better than he is, enough so that he will reach a Division I school not with a sense of privilege but rather with a sense of entitlement."]

They are still teaching the game to unproven millionaires in baggy jeans who have yet to learn their trade. Nineteen-year-old Darius Miles, taken third in the draft by the Clippers and thereby becoming the highest high school player ever picked, has four teammates who are 20.

Before no one is watching. Stern loves to bring up the television ratings declines throughout sports, as if the N.B.A. is merely stuck in some economic downturn unrelated to its product. No, David, it's not that. The public doesn't embrace your players as they once did, for reasons that begin before they come into the N.B.A. People don't talk about your league as passionately anymore.

There are treatments for vitiligo that are at least partly effective in many cases, but its cause is still under study. A prominent theory is that an autoimmune reaction is involved. The condition may also be associated with ailments, including thyroid disorders, and may flare up after injury, stress or severe sunburn. Patches occur in all races when pigment cells in the skin, called melanocytes, are destroyed and can no longer produce the pigment melanin, according to the National Vitiligo Foundation of Tyler, Tex., which maintains a clearinghouse for information about the condition. The most common treatment involves a drug called psoralen, taken orally. When followed by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet light, the drug seems to make pigment calls migrate from hair follicles to white areas. In some patients, steroids stop the spread of pigment loss. In others, like the singer Michael Jackson, doctors use chemicals to lighten unaffected skin areas so they blend in with those where pigment has been lost. Medical authorities also recommend avoiding excessive exposure to the sun. Tanning darkens normal areas, which makes the light ones more prominent because they cannot tan. C.

BOL\u00cdVARAmerican LiberatorBy Marie Arana603 pp. Simon & Schuster. (2013) To understand the landscape of Venezuelan politics, one must first understand the role of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who was known in the United States as the George Washington of South America for liberating Venezuela and much of the continent in the 1800s. Though progressive in many regards \u2014 for instance, he called for the abolition of slavery in 1816 \u2014 his vision was not of a democratic state. Instead, he insisted that the racial diversity in the region necessitated an \u201cinfinitely firm hand,\u201d which in his view meant uniting the newly independent countries into one grand Latin American federation and implementing a presidency-for-life system, naming himself the \u201cLiberator and Dictator.\u201d These ideas lost him the support of the United States and inspired an assassination attempt by a group of his own associates. Bol\u00edvar\u2019s political and military exploits are recounted in this entertaining volume. COMANDANTEHugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s VenezuelaBy Rory Carroll302 pp. The Penguin Press. (2013)"]
["books/review", "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ruled Venezuela for 14 years, from 1999 to 2013, won over the masses by promising what Rory Carroll describes as a \u201cBolivarian revolution, a self-styled radical effort to transform state and society into a vision worthy of Bol\u00edvar, a beacon of democracy, socialism and enlightenment.\u201d At first, he seemed successful; he used the country\u2019s wealth from oil revenue to fund programs that advanced social causes. But after a few years, Ch\u00e1vez became frustrated with the slow pace of democracy, and opted for more expedient but corrupt means. He intimidated government ministers and provided irresponsible, unsustainable handouts to Venezuela\u2019s poor. In this posthumous biography, Carroll, who covered Venezuela for The Guardian for six years, explains why Ch\u00e1vez kept getting re-elected, arguing that the self-proclaimed savior of Venezuela was a master \u201cillusionist\u201d who manipulated the country\u2019s citizens and news media to dismantle its democracy and create \u201ca laboratory of power and charisma that veered between hope, dread and farce.\u201d CRUDE NATIONHow Oil Riches Ruined VenezuelaBy Ra\u00fal Gallegos256 pp. Potomac Books. (2016) The farce has not held up since Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death in 2013. As a country that makes most of its money from oil, Venezuela is highly susceptible to the ups and downs of that market. In this book, Ra\u00fal Gallegos, a former Caracas-based correspondent, explains how mismanagement of this revenue by the government over the last century has caused the current crisis. When oil prices went down, it became clear that the country did not have the money or manufacturing infrastructure to provide basic necessities; goods such as milk, sugar and toilet paper started to disappear from the shelves. Gallegos provides crucial background for the country\u2019s present situation, and also offers a solution for fixing the country\u2019s economy and helping it re-enter the global energy industry."]
["sports/baseball", "DeGrom Equals a Strikeout Record, but the Mets Fall to the Marlins - The New York Times Once the first Miami Marlin had reached base Monday night, Jacob deGrom retook the mound, lowered his head and exhaled. The Citi Field crowd stood and applauded. DeGrom, the Mets\u2019 rookie starter, struck out the first eight batters he faced, tying a major league record to start a game. He appeared all but assured of breaking the record with Jarred Cosart, the opposing pitcher, coming to bat next. But one fastball drifted too far inside, and Cosart stuck out his bat and sent the pitch darting out of the reach of second baseman Dilson Herrera. The bullpen ultimately spoiled the game, as the Mets lost, 6-5, but the night belonged to deGrom. No pitcher had started a game like this since Jim Deshaies of the Houston Astros struck out the first eight Los Angeles Dodgers batters on Sept. 23, 1986. DeGrom finished with 13 strikeouts, a career high, and the most by a Mets starter this season. \u201cThat felt good,\u201d deGrom said. His performance also seemed to come at just the right time for the Mets. In the past week, the team announced that David Wright would sit out the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury. A former ticket-sales executive filed a lawsuit accusing the team\u2019s chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, of discrimination. And the team is desperately trying to avoid a sixth straight losing season."]
["sports/baseball", "DeGrom\u2019s bid for National League rookie of the year has served as a welcome distraction. Through his first 20 starts coming into Monday, his 2.62 earned run average as a rookie was lower than the rookie E.R.A. of both Tom Seaver (2.92) and Dwight Gooden (2.80). Entering Monday\u2019s start, deGrom had compiled a 1.77 E.R.A. since June 21 \u2014 only the Dodgers\u2019 Clayton Kershaw, the Indians\u2019 Corey Kluber and the Athletics\u2019 Jon Lester were better over that stretch. Still, deGrom faces competition in the rookie race, notably from Billy Hamilton, the speedy Cincinnati Reds center fielder. That is, perhaps, until deGrom\u2019s dominant display Monday. He led with his fastball to start. It touched 97 miles per hour, and he used it to finish off seven of those first eight strikeouts. The other came on a slider to Jordany Valdespin, the enigmatic former Met, who appeared to smile as Strike 3 was called. The Mets have seen dominance like this before. Seaver set the record for most consecutive strikeouts at any point in a game at 10, against the Padres, in April 1970. Seaver finished that game with 19 strikeouts. As deGrom approached the record, his demeanor remained unchanged. Among his qualities that have most impressed the Mets is how calm he appears under pressure. Even after Cosart\u2019s single, deGrom stayed composed until play was interrupted in the seventh. The Marlins\u2019 Justin Bour hit a single up the middle that deflected off deGrom\u2019s leg."]

Until then, deGrom had gone 28 innings without allowing an earned run. Before the game, deGrom and Zack Wheeler, another young Mets starter, watched their ace, Matt Harvey, throw a simulated game at Citi Field.

["sports", "Sports of The Times; Schmidt to Butkus to Lewis: Evolution of Middle Linebacker - The New York Times SOMEONE suggested to Ray Lewis last week that of all the positions on the football field, the one that had changed the least, that had remained closest to the game's primal roots, was middle linebacker, the position that experts contend Lewis plays better than anyone else of his generation. Lewis paused before answering. ''When you think about it, the position really has changed,'' he said. ''People are looking for middle linebackers who can run, who can be on the field for every down, who can cover running backs out of the backfield and slot receivers. That's what this league is turning into. Back in the day, you never had that.'' But Lewis did agree that the emotional requisites for the job had not changed. ''If you don't have a nasty attitude, something's wrong with you,'' he said. ''You've got to be downright nasty.'' The role of middle linebacker is relatively modern. The roots that lead to Ray Lewis began in 1933, when a rules change led to the modern passing game. Offenses would be allowed to throw anywhere beyond the line of scrimmage, not just the mandatory minimum of five yards. ''Little by little,'' said Joe Schmidt, the Hall of Famer and considered the first defender to play middle linebacker, ''the offense dictated the changes on defense. The middle was open. No one was there to stop the pass over the middle.''"]
["sports", "In 1940, the Chicago Bears introduced the modern T formation, and with it destroyed Washington by 73-0 in the championship game that year. In the 1950's, defenses evolved from a six-man front to the 5-2-4 defense designed to stop high-powered passing attacks. The middle was still a free zone, receivers crossing the middle free and clear. By 1955, the 5-2 had given way to the 4-3, fine-tuned by Jim Lee Howell and Tom Landry, then a player-coach with the Giants. More teams were replacing the middle guard with a mobile middle linebacker. In 1954, Schmidt was the first to play there full time. ''The hardest part was learning to play a position that had not existed,'' he said last week. ''There was no position coach. They just tell you what to do and determine how to get it done. How to handle blockers, how to flow with the play, all those things you had to pick up on your own.'' The middle linebacker's most crucial function was to make receivers pay a toll when they came across the middle. Official notice that the middle was closed came in 1960 with Chuck Bednarik's pulverizing tackle on Giants receiver Frank Gifford. As a result of the hit, Gifford was out for more than a year. With the advent of the middle linebacker, defenses effectively took back the middle of the field, and offenses have spent 46 years trying to recover it."]
["sports", "But the most significant milestone from Bednarik to Lewis was not a defensive scheme but a documentary. In 1960, Walter Cronkite narrated CBS's ''The Violent World of Sam Huff,'' detailing the football life of the Giants' fourth-year middle linebacker. ''That was the first time anybody got a player to comment while in action as he grunted and growled and groaned in the process of being a middle linebacker,'' Cronkite said last week. ''People were stunned by the violence of the sport; they did not realize how violent it was in the scrum. The position finally was given the due it deserved. Until then people just thought these were big, heavy guys who fell on the line with no technique.'' Huff became an instant celebrity and defense became in vogue; Ray Nitschke was the most valuable player of the 1962 title game. But Dick Butkus became and remains the model of a middle linebacker. The award for the best linebacker in college is named in his honor, and even fellow linebackers invoke his name to illustrate a hard hit. When Butkus joined the Bears in 1965, Bill George was their middle linebacker. George was 6 feet 2, 234 pounds and 34 years old; Butkus was 6-3, 240 and 21. The next season, George went to the Rams and Butkus took possession of the position and the legacy. ''I guess I had the right package to play that position emotionally and physically,'' Butkus said last week. ''I had the size, I could move and I studied the game -- I still have the 16 millimeter projector I lifted from the Bears.''"]
["sports", "The quality that Butkus possessed joins middle linebackers across generations. Ray Lewis called it passion; Joe Schmidt called it love of the game. ''No one ever knew how much desire that I had going into a game,'' Butkus said. ''I felt that I had to make every tackle or that I had to try to make every tackle.'' Willie Lanier was drafted two years after Butkus, in 1967 by Kansas City. Lanier was such a pulverizing tackler coming out of Morgan State that his teammates called him Contact. He hit with such force that the team put special padding on his helmet. After sustaining a debilitating head injury in his first season, Lanier changed from being a devastating tackler to being a precision tackler. There was also a sociological component. Lanier became the first African-American to start and star at middle linebacker, a position previously denied blacks. Coaches did not think they possessed the qualities needed: quick thinking, good judgment, leadership and a confluence of mental and physical skills. So, these classic players were asked, how good is Ray Lewis? Schmidt said that Lewis represented the highest evolution of the position; Lanier said that Lewis was special. ''He has everything you want in that position,'' Butkus said. Lewis's legacy as a middle linebacker may be cemented -- one way or another -- tonight."]
["sports", "''If you play that game and win, more people will have a chance to see you,'' said Lanier, who made three memorable tackles in Kansas City's victory in Super Bowl IV. ''If you have a very good game, that will emphasize that those things they heard about you could be correct. If you don't have quite as good a game, the people will still have questions.

["world/europe", "As Spain Mourns, Hunt Intensifies for Van Driver in Barcelona Attack - The New York Times BARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Spain\u2019s royal family and prime minister joined numerous dignitaries and Muslim leaders on Sunday to mourn the 14 people killed in twin attacks last week, the deadliest case of terrorism in the country since 2004. As the nation grieved, the hunt continued for Younes Abouyaaqoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan-born man who the authorities said might have driven a van that mowed down pedestrians on Las Ramblas, Barcelona\u2019s famous promenade, on Thursday afternoon, killing 13. A 14th person died in a car attack hours later in the seaside town of Cambrils, 70 miles to the south. Mr. Abouyaaqoub is believed to be the only member of a cell of at least 12 men who is still on the run, said Maj. Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, the police chief in the Catalonia region, of which Barcelona is the capital, but whether he was still in Spain was not clear. The Catalan police said on Sunday that they had unearthed more than 100 gas cylinders in the rubble of a house thought to be used by the Barcelona attackers as a bomb factory \u2014 a vivid indication that an even larger assault had been planned. An explosion on Wednesday night that killed at least two people destroyed the house, in Alcanar, a town about 120 miles southwest of Barcelona. At first thought to be a gas explosion, the blast now appears to have been the hub of a wider plot to sow terror."]
["world/europe", "Some of the 12 members of the cell had occupied the house for at least six months, Major Trapero said. He said that one man injured in the explosion in Alcanar on Wednesday was arrested after the attack in Barcelona. \u201cThere is explosive material that keeps appearing among the ruins, and it\u2019s a very slow process,\u201d Major Trapero said of the investigation at the house, adding that \u201cit will probably take days.\u201d Along with the house in Alcanar, the authorities were focusing on Ripoll, a town about 70 miles north of Barcelona, not far from the Pyrenees. Ripoll was the home of most of the suspects involved in the terrorist plot, according to the authorities, including Abdelbaki Essati, the local imam, one of two men who may have died in the Wednesday explosion. Five of the 10 other men believed to have been involved in the cell were killed in Cambrils, and four are under arrest, officials said. Mr. Abouyaaqoub is thought to have been the driver of the van. The authorities said it was possible that he had slipped into France. Investigators are trying to establish the role of the imam, Mr. Essati, in the cell. He had been connected to extremists more than a decade earlier, and he shared an apartment in the town of Vilanova that the police raided in 2006 as part of an investigation into another cell that also recruited fighters for Iraq, according to local news reports."]
["world/europe", "The imam is also believed to have been connected to Mohamed Mrabet Fhasi, who tried to help a militant escape after the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Mr. Essati served time in prison, but on charges related to drugs, not terrorism. Major Trapero declined to give details on Sunday about the investigation into the imam\u2019s possible role, but he reiterated that neither the imam nor the members of the cell, many of whom were teenagers, had known links to terrorism. Major Trapero also said that investigators were using information received from \u201csome other countries\u201d and looking into possible overseas trips by members of the cell ahead of the attacks. But he would not elaborate on whether the cell had links to extremists in other parts of Europe and Morocco. Even though not all members of the cell are accounted for, \u201cwe consider that the capacity to act of this cell has been neutralized,\u201d Joaquim Forn, a member of Catalonia\u2019s regional government, said on Sunday. The original plan for attack involved at least three vans, as well as the Audi car that five assailants used in the attack in Cambrils. Major Trapero said investigators were using fingerprints from the vehicles to confirm the exact whereabouts of the assailants. \u201cIn recent months, this group had planned one or more attacks in the city of Barcelona with which they hoped to do a lot more damage than what they already managed,\u201d he said.

Mr. de Blasio had pledged \u201con Day 1\u201d to rid Central Park of its signature four-legged tourist attraction, a Victorian vestige that has been denounced as torture by activists who say the animals are mistreated and vulnerable to accidents when traversing Midtown streets.

Now, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s team is unveiling a bill that would phase out the industry by the middle of 2016, while offering soon-to-be-unemployed carriage drivers a carrot of sorts: job training classes and a waiver of most fees for licenses to operate \u201cgreen\u201d taxicabs, which can pick up passengers outside the busiest parts of Manhattan. The bill would also prohibit the use of horse-drawn carriages throughout the city, with exceptions allowed for film sets and some parades. The legislation, described by three people familiar with its contents, would first have to pass the City Council, whose members are mixed on the proposal. A vote is not expected until next year, and a spokesman for the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, said she was still reviewing the bill, which was first reported by Capital New York."]

["living", "CUTTINGS; Hybrid Musk Roses: Scent Above All Else - The New York Times I LOVE just about all roses, with the possible exception of Rosa viridiflora, a horticultural oddity with blossoms that look like pale green spiders. If I had the sunny space, I would fill my property with hundreds of bushes. Love is wonderful, but passion is even better. And when it comes to roses, hybrid musks are my passion. These free-blooming roses continue to captivate because of their fragrance. Rose experts can discourse at length about hints of lemon and vanilla and overtones of myrrh, but the best hybrid musks smell like essence of roses. A mature specimen of Felicity or Penelope also has luminous blossoms, and a likable, relaxed growth habit, but for me, scent eclipses all other considerations. Hybrid musk roses are definitely hybrids, though their relationship to true musk roses (Rosa moschata) is distant at best. Fortunately, antecedents matter more to rose breeders than they do to most people who grow roses. What really matters is that the hybrid musks are hardy, floriferous, easy on the eyes, and easy to care for. Hybrid musk roses tend to form good-sized shrubs, four to five feet tall and four feet wide. Some grow large enough to use as short climbers. Their growth habit has been described as ''relaxed,'' meaning that the canes go where they please, avoiding the stiff, upright stance characteristic of the hybrid teas. Most hybrid musks produce clusters of strongly scented pink, yellow or apricot flowers, with a stupendous first flush in May or early June, and less abundant spurts of bloom thereafter until frost. I have found that hybrid musks are not impervious to black spot and powdery mildew, but recover strongly from them."]
["living", "Contemporary breeders continue to introduce new ones, but I think most of the best hybrid musks are the originals, bred during the first quarter of the 20th century in England by the Rev. Joseph Pemberton (1852-1926). Pemberton, one of a long line of Anglican clergymen who were horticulturists, lived with his sister and fellow rosarian, Florence, in Havering, a village in Essex. Beginning around 1912, he began offering his new roses to the public, and ever since then, there have been at least a few of them in commerce. Between 1912 and 1926 Pemberton introduced about 25 different new-named varieties, many of which resulted from cross-breeding efforts involving Trier, a lanky rose with small white flowers. After Pemberton's death, his sister introduced at least 10 additional roses selected from his seedlings. Later, during the 1930's, Pemberton's assistant, J. A. Bentall, brought out more hybrid musks, including the still-popular Ballerina. The list of Pemberton roses is interesting. Two-thirds of them are named after women, many of them figures from Greek or Roman mythology, including Thisbe, Clytemnestra and Aurora. Only two, Sammy and Robin Hood, are named after men. For some reason, Pemberton's orange roses -- Rachel, Naomi, Ruth and Joan -- did not enjoy the lasting success of some of his less flamboyantly colored creations. Pax, a white-flowering shrub, was introduced in 1918 to commemorate the end of World War I, predating the fabled hybrid tea Peace by one generation and one war."]
["living", "I bought my first Pemberton hybrid musk a decade ago, when I didn't know much about roses. Fortunately, I knew that I liked fragrance, and the catalog promised that Felicia, a rose introduced in 1928, was ''extremely fragrant.'' Felicia delivered on that promise, providing many healthy trusses of three-inch shell pink blooms. The rose has since been transplanted twice and has flourished in less than optimal light conditions. After the first couple of growing seasons, I became so fond of Felicia that I bought another hybrid musk, Buff Beauty, from one of the antique rose catalogs. Buff Beauty may have been one of Pemberton's last seedlings. It was introduced in 1939, after Bentall's death, by his widow, Anne. True to its name, the plant bears blossoms that are a warm buff yellow color, with the characteristic hybrid musk fragrance. When Buff Beauty arrived on my doorstep, the only available space in my garden was in lightly dappled shade. The lanky yellow rose succeeded, and my passion grew. Since then I have acquired other Pemberton musks, including Penelope, Kathleen, Vanity and Pax. Now just about the only thing that I find harder to acquire than additional hybrid musks is restraint. Of the 35 Pemberton-Bentall roses, fewer than 20 are commercially available.  I troll nurseries and surf the Internet in search of hard-to-find varieties. A few years ago I found a great Web site -- www.helpmefind.com /sites/rrr/rosetest.html -- which contains a complete list of the Pemberton roses, along with details about each variety's appearance, growth habits and commercial availability."]

The same is true for male house finches, according to a new study. Female house finches prefer to mate with males with the reddest feathers, but dull-colored males make themselves more appealing by acting more social before mating season, according to a study in the September issue of the American Naturalist.  The researchers found that the duller a male bird was in color, the more likely he was to engage with multiple social groups. Birds in a social group flock and forage together and any bird can belong to multiple groups. Drab-looking male finches drifted from group to group in the winter, the researchers found. By mating season in the spring, the less attractive males tended to have the same level of mating success as the most colorful, attractive males. \u201cFemales have limited options to chose from and this is a way for males to manipulate their chances to find mates, by placing themselves in certain settings,\u201d said Kevin Oh, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University and the study\u2019s lead author.

["world/middleeast", "Mubarak to Be Transferred to House Arrest - The New York Times CAIRO \u2014  Egypt\u2019s military-appointed government ordered former President Hosni Mubarak transferred from prison to house arrest late Wednesday after a court said he could no longer legally be held behind bars. The order, announced by the cabinet, did not specify when the transfer would take place or where Mr. Mubarak would be moved, but said it could happen as early as Thursday. Mr. Mubarak, who led Egypt for 30 years, has spent the past 17 months in prison. Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release from prison to a much milder form of incarceration injects a potentially volatile new element into the political crisis that has been convulsing the country in the six weeks since the military ousted the man who replaced Mr. Mubarak, the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Mohamed Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first freely elected president. Mr. Morsi remains under indefinite detention in an undisclosed location with no access to legal counsel. The announcement regarding Mr. Mubarak came after an Egyptian court ruled that all appeals by prosecutors to keep him locked in prison had been exhausted. An official in the office of his lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said the firm expected that Mr. Mubarak, 85, would be released within a matter of hours. It was unclear why the cabinet had decreed Mr. Mubarak must remain under house arrest. But under the state of emergency declared in Egypt after Mr. Morsi was deposed, the military-appointed government can exert unlimited powers in the country\u2019s easily manipulated judicial system."]
["world/middleeast", "Even some of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s opponents expected his release. \u201cWe are now facing a sound release order, and the prosecution will appeal and the appeal will be denied and he will walk out, and he has a right to do so,\u201d said Khaled Abu Bakr, a prominent lawyer involved in the cases of protesters killed during the demonstrations against Mr. Mubarak that preceded his downfall more than two years ago. Wednesday\u2019s court order applied to the last of at least three prosecutions that Mr. Mubarak still faced. He had already been ordered freed pending trial on two other cases, including a retrial on charges of complicity in the deaths of 800 protesters at the end of his regime in January 2011. The juxtaposition of leniency for Mr. Mubarak while Mr. Morsi remains in custody could test the level of support for the military-led government among the many anti-Mubarak people who later sided with the decision to depose Mr. Morsi and crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood. Reached by telephone and told that Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release from prison now looked imminent, Ahmed Maher, the founder of the 6th of April youth group that helped start the revolution, was initially silent for several moments. \u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d he said. But he said he saw no likelihood of street protests because opponents of the government had been cowed into silence by widespread killings and arrests. \u201cIf anybody even thinks of objecting, they will suffer,\u201d he said."]
["world/middleeast", "\u201cIf anybody dares express opposition against the government or the president or the military, they\u2019ll be accused of treason and called a Muslim Brother in hiding,\u201d Mr. Maher said. In Tahrir Square in Cairo, where protesters once hung banners and nooses demanding Mr. Mubarak\u2019s execution, public opinion appeared to have moved on. No one seemed to care much about Mr. Mubarak\u2019s fate. The only ones who did seemed to be groups of Western journalists looking for reactions. There was more concern from the Tamarod movement, the organization that ran a petition drive calling for Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster and for the June 30 demonstrations that led the military to depose him. The group accused Mr. Morsi of not having prosecuted Mr. Mubarak and his subordinates aggressively enough for the deaths of protesters. Ahmed al-Bahrawy, a prosecutor in charge of trying serious public corruption cases, said that his staff would not be able to appeal the release order in Mr. Mubarak\u2019s case because it had been issued at the court\u2019s appellate level already. According to Al Ahram, the state newspaper, citing security concerns, authorities moved the latest trial in Mr. Mubarak\u2019s case to the prison where he has been held, rather than forcing him to endure the spectacle of a public court hearing, as he had done in the past. The formal decision to release Mr. Mubarak was made by the Northern Court of Appeals in Cairo in the so-called Al Ahram gifts case."]
["world/middleeast", "Mr. Mubarak was charged with corruption for accepting a series of gifts valued at 18 million Egyptian pounds, about $2.6 million, from Al Ahram, the state-owned news organization. Mr. Mubarak\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Deeb, argued that he should be released pending trial because he had already made restitution for that amount to Al Ahram. Mr. Deeb had argued that keeping Mr. Mubarak in prison, where he has languished since April 2011, was abusive and exceeded the legal limits for a prisoner awaiting trial. Chronically ill, Mr. Mubarak has been held most recently in the Tora Prison\u2019s hospital wing. Mr. Mubarak\u2019s two sons, Gamal and Alaa, remain incarcerated pending other corruption charges. Their cases have not been brought to trial. Mr. Abu Bakr said that it was routine in Egyptian legal proceedings for prosecutors to automatically appeal release orders and that normally, courts rejected those appeals. In past months, that procedural tradition was ignored because of political pressure to keep Mr. Mubarak behind bars, he said. \u201cWhat happened before, when prosecutors pre-empted Mubarak\u2019s release with new charges to keep him held under Morsi, is a mockery,\u201d Mr. Abu Bakr said. Mr. Mubarak led Egypt with the support of the Egyptian military, until the military bowed to popular protests and removed him from office in February 2011. Mr. Mubarak\u2019s ouster, and the disgrace of a public trial in courtrooms full of opponents and television cameras, was deeply unpopular among some of Egypt\u2019s allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, which helped put together a $12 billion aid package for Egypt after Mr. Morsi was deposed last month."]
["world/middleeast", "The money will help offset threats from the United States and European countries to cut off aid over the huge numbers of deaths in the pro-Morsi protests. Still, the Egyptian military remains dependent on Washington\u2019s aid for upgrades and maintenance of its American military hardware. Just in the past week, more than 1,100 people have been killed and hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood activists and leaders have been arrested, including their spiritual leader, Mohamed Badie. Mr. Morsi\u2019s own arrest shortly after the military takeover on July 3 was initially without formal charges, although he has subsequently been charged with having escaped from prison during the anti-Mubarak revolution. He had been jailed for protesting against Mr. Mubarak, and when the prison fell to a general revolt by prisoners, he was among many who walked out \u2014 although he publicly announced his presence to avoid being charged with the crime of prison break. Yet unlike Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Morsi has not had access to a lawyer or visits from family members, who have no idea where he is being held. Mr. Morsi\u2019s overthrow, and the military\u2019s imposition of martial law and announcement that it would hold a referendum on a new constitution, have generally been popular, even among many who previously opposed Mr. Mubarak\u2019s government. That included even many of the early revolutionary groups. \u201cThe release of Mubarak may be the chance for others to snap out of it, and understand what\u2019s really happening: the return of the old regime,\u201d said Mr. Maher, of the 6th of April group."]

A German sailing couple, seized and held for ransom eight years ago by Somali pirates, apparently lived by that rule. A German yachting website reported Monday that the couple appeared to have been abducted again, this time while cruising a dangerous area of the Philippines, by militants of Abu Sayyaf, an insurgent group known for kidnapping and ransoming foreigners. The woman was said to have been killed. The couple, J\u00fcrgen Kantner, 70, and his partner, Sabine Merz, have been sailing the oceans for many years aboard their 53-footer, the Rockall. They were held for 52 days in Somalia in 2008 before their captors freed them, reportedly after a six-figure ransom had been paid. The Philippine media on Monday reported that a German couple had been attacked while sailing in an area of the southern Philippines under the control of Abu Sayyaf. The woman was shot and the man abducted, the reports said. The Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted a spokesman for Abu Sayyaf as saying via telephone that the woman had fired upon them. \u201cOur men shot back and killed her,\u201d he said.

["science", "Diet Low in Salt and Fat Can Reduce Blood Pressure - The New York Times Cutting back on salt and eating more fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products can reduce blood pressure to a level on par with that achieved by blood pressure-lowering drugs, researchers report. This is true whether you are black, white or in another ethnic group, male or female, and have elevated or normal blood pressure. Study findings also suggest that current recommendations to consume no more than 2,400 milligrams (mg) of salt daily may be too high, according to a report in the January 4th issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. ``These results provide a scientific basis for a lower goal for dietary sodium than the level currently recommended,'' write Dr. Frank M. Sacks, from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues. The findings add to the ongoing debate over the role of dietary salt in hypertension, or high blood pressure. While some studies have found that consuming large amounts of salt may raise the risk of high blood pressure and therefore heart disease, other research suggests that only certain people are susceptible to the effects of salt on blood pressure. The current study included 412 people who followed either a typical American diet (red meat, sweets, sugar-containing drinks and few fruits and vegetables) or the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)."]
["science", "The DASH diet, which is prescribed to people with high blood pressure, emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish and nuts. It contains less fat and cholesterol and more minerals, fiber and protein than the typical American diet. The study participants consumed a diet with high-, medium- or low-salt intake. People who reduced their daily salt intake to about 1,500 mg daily saw reductions in blood pressure even as they continued to eat a typical American diet of about 2,100 calories. While the DASH diet alone reduced blood pressure, combining it with a low-sodium diet packed a one-two blood pressure-lowering punch. In those with high blood pressure, the ''effects were equal to or greater than'' taking a blood pressure-lowering drug, the report indicates. The results held true in men and women, blacks and whites, and people with and without high blood pressure. In an interview with Reuters Health, study co-author Dr. Eva Obarzanek said that reducing salt intake to about 1,500 mg a day is not easy in the context of the American lifestyle and food choices. Much of the salt that is consumed is hidden in prepared or processed food, rather than table salt. ``It is necessary to get help from the food industry and restaurants and fast food places,'' she said. Americans consume an average of 3,500 milligrams of salt each day, the researchers point out."]
["science", "The authors of the study note that the ultimate health benefits of normal blood pressure, which include a reduced risk of heart disease, depend on a person's ability to follow a healthy diet over the long term and greater availability of low-salt foods. ``Lower salt and the DASH diet should be recommended to the general population in hopes of preventing hypertension and the rise of blood pressure that occurs with advancing age,'' Obarzanek told Reuters Health.

This likable hockey memoir is shot through with winter light: blue-black dusks under which skaters flick and glide across frozen Massachusetts ponds. Atkinson, a 42-year-old novelist and Bobby Orr fan, takes a job as an assistant coach for his old high school team, the Methuen Rangers. As he follows the talented players through their 1999 season, he makes a case for hockey as a guide to life, or as a partial compensation for it. He has a sharp descriptive sense: one freshman looks like ''a sinister elf,'' and Atkinson hears the ''wild breathing inside my helmet'' as he flies down the wing in an alumni game. His ear for high school wit is even better: an upperclassman cuts ahead of a freshman in practice and explains, ''I have juniority.'' The book's major flaw is that the Rangers do not fully admit Atkinson into their secret world. And the players are far too polite: one bad-boy player with a nasty streak provides the only ''what will he do next?'' excitement. But Atkinson offers affecting elegies to small-town life.

Since then, he said, wait times for doctor visits at the hospitals across the country have gone down. Mr. McDonald said that at the department\u2019s medical center in Phoenix \u2014 where delays in care contributed to the deaths of several patients \u2014 wait times have gone down by as much as 37 percent.

The investigation is focusing on whether manufacturers of the drugs, which are known as opioids, overstated their benefits and understated their risks, such as the chances that a patient could become addicted to the drugs, a court filing shows. Should the inquiry determine that the companies made false claims, the city would then seek to recover millions of dollars in health care dollars spent on pain drugs used to treat city employees and retirees, the court filing shows.

The fighting today, on the first day of the Jewish New Year, an Israeli national holiday that is commemorated as a time for quiet reflection and prayer, was among the bloodiest confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in recent years. The violence, which began in Jerusalem, spread today from the northern edge of the West Bank to the end of Gaza Strip, escalating in two places into gun battles between Palestinians and Israeli security forces. Palestinian youths burned tires and bombarded Israeli soldiers and the police with rocks and firebombs; Israeli troops responded variously with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The Israeli military said tonight that seven soldiers had been ''lightly wounded'' by rocks in the disturbances today. At least 16 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds injured in the last three days. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in a statement that he spoke with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, tonight ''and stressed the importance of Arafat's immediate personal involvement to stop the violence.'' They agreed that ''senior security officials from both sides will be in constant contact for the purpose of restoring calm,'' the statement said."]

The ambulance driver was killed as he tried to rescue the boy.

More than 200 Palestinians were reported wounded in the bloody Gaza clash, which erupted from demonstrations protesting Mr. Sharon's visit to the mosques on Thursday morning and the storming of the Muslim religious site on Friday afternoon by heavily armed Israeli troops. The Gaza protesters, many of them sympathizers of the radical fundamentalist Hamas movement, directed their fury not just at Mr. Sharon, but also at Mr. Arafat, ripping up posters of the Palestinian leader. In East Jerusalem, Palestinian protesters fought sporadically with Israeli troops throughout the day, and a teen-age boy was killed during a clash with Israeli forces near Ramallah.

Internal policing is handled by Palestinian Authority officials and by the Islamic clerics who exercise religious control over the mosques and surrounding courtyard. Mr. Sharon, who obtained Israeli police permission to lead a delegation from his rightist opposition Likkud party to the plaza, has vociferously objected to suggestions that a peace pact might give an independent Palestine state whole or partial sovereignty over the site. His visit infuriated Palestinians, who continue to associate Mr. Sharon with the massacres of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon two decades ago, and who are united in demanding control over what is considered the third most sacred site in Islam. On Israeli television tonight, Mr. Sharon denied that it was his visit that had touched off violence. ''It was not my visit that lit the fire, but Palestinian incitement,'' he said. Mr. Barak did not comment on Thursday about Mr. Sharon's action, nor did he on this holiday, when domestic politics is traditionally given a rest. And neither he nor his associates publicly linked the violence to the Likud leader's Temple Mount visit.

Israeli army spokesmen said the troops came under live fire from the Palestinian police. But television footage of the incident, including the shooting of the 12-year-old boy, and the absence of any serious Israeli casualties, served to reinforce the Palestinians' belief that the Israelis were responding with disproportionate force.

''There is a definite lack of federal leadership with regard to H.I.V. prevention,'' and ''there is no time to lose,'' the organization, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a strongly worded report that called for a new national strategy in combating H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The report called on the government to improve its tracking of new H.I.V. infections to help communities better implement appropriate prevention services, develop better sex education programs, help deliver more public health messages to overcome complacency about the seriousness of the epidemic and provide more money for needle exchange and treatment programs for injecting drug users. It also called on health insurance organizations to pay for the time it takes for doctors to deliver prevention messages as part of clinical care. Federal, state and local laws and policies that hinder proven prevention strategies should be abolished, the report said. It said the government spends $250 million over five years for sex education programs that emphasize only abstinence without any evidence that such efforts are effective in preventing H.I.V. infections."]

The report also urged the government to revise the way it spends the $775 million for prevention each year and to adopt a specific plan to sharply reduce the estimated 40,000 new cases a year, a figure that has been stable since 1992. The figure contrasts with the 160,000 new infections that occurred at the peak of the epidemic in this country in the mid-1980's, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

''We have a fluid epidemic, and there is a sense of urgency particularly among minority and other communities hardest hit.''

Responding to the report, Dr. Helene Gayle, the director of the AIDS program at the centers, said her agency was in general agreement with the recommendations. For example, Dr. Gayle said, the agency has issued a draft of its plan that aims to reduce by half the annual incidence of new H.I.V. infections by 2005. The report said ''there must be a strong, clear leadership structure in the Department of Health and Human Services.'' Because many agencies share responsibility for federal H.I.V. prevention activities, the agencies compete for resources and public attention and ''there is no explicit strategy that currently guides the overall investment of federal H.I.V. prevention funds,'' the panel said."]
["us", "The basis of financing should be preventing the greatest number of infections for a given amount of money, the report said, adding that the government ''should be held accountable'' for such decisions. The report urged wider application of a testing method C.D.C. has developed that tells more accurately than current tests when a person was infected, allowing public health officials to determine where the epidemic is heading. The report said it would be more cost-effective to spend money on needle exchange programs and preventing infections among newborns than developing tests to screen for tainted blood, which can be very expensive. The report said that testing and treating pregnant women cost about $32,000 for each infection prevented and that needle exchange programs cost $3,000 to $50,000 for each infection prevented but that screening blood for transfusions cost $7.5 million for each infection averted. ''It is difficult to reconcile a difference of such magnitude,'' the report said. Dr. Edward H. Kaplan, a professor at the Yale School of Management, said the report, which he co-wrote, should be regarded as a blueprint for the next White House administration. Correction: September 29, 2000, Friday  A picture caption yesterday with an article about a report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences that criticized the Clinton administration's AIDS policy misidentified an educator who spoke in Washington about the report. He was Dr. Michael H. Merson, dean of public health at Yale, not Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, provost of Harvard."]
["sports/basketball", "Even With Mr. Whammy, Nets Are No Match for LeBron James and the Cavs - The New York Times LeBron James, playing for a Cleveland Cavaliers team well ahead of the pack in the N.B.A.\u2019s Eastern Conference, blew once on his hand, then delivered a flawless free throw during warm-ups before Friday night\u2019s game against the Nets. Players often say that practice cannot match game conditions, and this was never truer than in the case of James\u2019s free-throw shooting at Barclays Center. That is because James\u2019s shots, before a 116-108 victory over the Nets, occurred before the arrival of Bruce Reznick, 80, a retired lawyer from Brooklyn and a longtime Nets fan known as Mr. Whammy. Reznick was still en route to the arena via car service at the time with his wife, Judy, known as Mrs. Whammy. During the Nets\u2019 games, Bruce Reznick stands a few feet in front of his seat behind the basket, jumps up and down and casts a spell on visiting team\u2019s players to make them miss free throws. The antics between Reznick and James represent the longest-standing tradition in the relatively short history of James\u2019s visits to Brooklyn. In 2015, James reportedly asked to have Reznick returned to his seat. The Cavaliers denied this, and James declined to comment at the time. Reznick called James a \u201ccrybaby,\u201d and his exile was short-lived. Even after bringing a long-sought championship to Cleveland, James still did not have much to say about his Brooklyn foil."]
["sports/basketball", "\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d James said before Friday\u2019s game. When provided with a description, he said, \u201cThat older guy. Yeah, I\u2019ve got no rivalry with him. You\u2019re trying to create a story there.\u201d Reznick does not see it that way. And considering James shot 62.5 percent from the free-throw line in 2015-16 at Barclays Center, well below his mark of 73.1 percent that season, Mr. Whammy may have a point. \u201cI consider myself not just the rival of LeBron James but of every opposing player who comes through Barclays Center,\u201d Reznick said, posing for selfies with fans after having arrived for Friday\u2019s game. Sure enough, the Cavs finished just 8 of 18 from the free-throw line whenever they shot them on Reznick\u2019s end of the court. Reznick and James faced off with 5 minutes 19 seconds left in the first quarter. \u201cI know you can miss! Look at me! Gotta miss!\u201d Reznick shouted, waving his arms next to the basket and jumping as James\u2019s first shot rimmed out. But James has plenty of other things on his agenda, including the continued building of the Cavaliers as they defend their title. They made quick work of the Nets Friday, building a sizable cushion with a 13-0 run just before halftime. By the third quarter, the Cavs extended their lead to 24 points. The Nets fought back to cut the lead to single digits in the fourth, but ultimately saw their record fall to 8-27, a mirror image of Cleveland\u2019s 27-8."]
["sports/basketball", "And the Cavs, it appears, are about to get even better. Kyle Korver is reportedly headed to Cleveland from the Atlanta Hawks, and although the trade has yet to happen, James and his teammates sounded as if they had already begun counting the baskets that are sure to follow when James, who is second in the league on 3-point assists, teams up with Korver, a career 42.9 percent shooter from that distance. When a reporter pointed out Korver\u2019s accuracy, James said: \u201cIt\u2019ll go higher than that. We\u2019ll get him the ball. He\u2019s on the court for a reason.\u201d Korver would help cover the loss of J. R. Smith, who is recovering from an operation on his thumb. The rest of Cleveland\u2019s problems are short term. Kyrie Irving missed three games with a tight hamstring but returned on Friday night. James battled the flu. And Kevin Love lost 10 pounds after a bout with food poisoning that left him considering a trip to the hospital at 5 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day. Love did not offer a timetable for returning to sea bass, the offending dish on a team flight, saying instead he would stick with \u201cchicken soup and the BRAT diet,\u201d referring to a banana, rice, applesauce and toast regimen that helps alleviate stomach ailments. While the Cavaliers continued their pursuit of Korver, who would add an All-Star to a team that few think can be caught in the Eastern Conference, the Nets and Coach Kenny Atkinson found themselves playing Cleveland on the second night of a back-to-back, part of a stretch that takes them to three cities between Thursday and Sunday."]

But Levert, a rookie guard who finished with 19, was not going it alone. He had some help. \u201cI wish LeBron James, and every player who comes in here, good luck, good health, except when they come to Barclays Center,\u201d Reznick said. \u201cBut here, they have to miss the shots.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "Where Are Baseball\u2019s Minority Managers? - The New York Times CHICAGO \u2014 Gary Jones came jogging over during a cool, autumnal batting practice at Wrigley Field. An athletic-looking man with a thin trace of a gray-flecked mustache, he is the infield and third-base coach on the Cubs\u2019 roundhouse punch of a World Series team. I mean to take nothing away from this fine moment by asking: Do you still dream of being a manager? I ask because this 55-year-old man is a 15-year minor league manager with a winning record and multiple titles to his name. He has won four Manager of the Year Awards in the minors. Then he moved upstairs with the San Diego Padres and won three organizational awards for excellence in player development. He whistles softly. \u201cI mean, I haven\u2019t thought about it for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the years go by, you kind of put it on the back burner. But I\u2019m not going to say the door is closed.\u201d I have left out a salient detail here: Jones is a black man. And Major League Baseball remains a sport sliding backward in this regard. Last year baseball had one Latino and no black managers. Now it has one Latino, the newly hired Rick Renteria of the White Sox, and two black managers, Dusty Baker and Dave Roberts. Those two men guided their teams, the Washington Nationals and the Los Angeles Dodgers, to the playoffs. Twenty-seven non-Hispanic white men manage major league baseball teams."]
["sports/baseball", "A year ago, I asked Commissioner Rob Manfred about the dearth of nonwhite managers. As recently as 2009, baseball had 10 black and Latino managers. Manfred advised me to take the long view. \u201cThere is a certain cyclical nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are peaks and valleys.\u201d A year later baseball is still lost in that valley. So I put the same question to Manfred. When does that next peak come, Mr. Commissioner? \u201cWe\u2019re going to have ebb and flow,\u201d he replied. \u201cThere is a certain cyclical nature to this.\u201d He\u2019s good at this business of saying nothing. He talked of pipelines and entry-level programs and making sure that candidates from minority groups are prepared and effective in interviews. That just left me more puzzled. Jones long ago passed the entry-level door. He sounds knowledgeable and voluble, and ready to take the helm of a team. Charlie Montoyo, 51, a Puerto Rican-born baseball man, has managed all over the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 system for two decades with a .526 winning percentage. At the highest level of the Rays\u2019 minor league system, his team set a franchise record for wins in a single season. He was twice named manager of the year. The Tampa Bay manager job came open recently. Montoyo was passed over in favor of Kevin Cash, 38, who served a couple of years as an advance scout and bench coach. Montoyo is Hispanic; Cash is white."]
["sports/baseball", "I don\u2019t want to simplify, at least not too much. Cash may possess a fine baseball mind. The same might be true of Craig Counsell, who is white and was a nice enough major league infielder. He retired in 2012 and promptly took a job with the Milwaukee Brewers as special assistant to the general manager. Then he was hired by the team\u2019s television broadcast team. Then he applied to become manager. He got the job, avoiding the need to take an entry-level position. This situation only gets worse in the front offices. There is not a single black or Latino in the positions of chief executive or president of a club. Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport issues an annual report on racial and gender hiring. The most recent report offers sad findings and a few oddly generous grades. It lists baseball as having four general managers who are \u201cpeople of color.\u201d This number curiously includes Jeff Luhnow of the Houston Astros. Luhnow\u2019s father and mother are white; his father was an advertising executive who moved to Mexico City. A year later, his wife gave birth to Jeff. He attended an American school in Mexico City and learned to speak fluent Spanish. This is great life experience, and he is a fine executive. He is not, however, Latino or a \u201cperson of color.\u201d The picture at the granular level does not improve. The Mets\u2019 board of directors is composed entirely of white men. The team has no black vice presidents, and only three women in executive positions."]

Oh, and then there\u2019s Willie Randolph. He managed the Mets for three and a half years and finished with a record of 302 wins and 253 losses. Then he got fired, as eventually happens to nearly all managers. The rap was that he could be testy and brittle. Terry Collins, the Mets\u2019 current and quite likable manager, often has spoken of his sometimes-troubled first managerial stint, when he was seen as a temple-throbbing Type A sort who drove players nuts. He got fired; now he\u2019s seen as a player\u2019s manager. In other words, he reflected and matured. You wonder if Randolph, now 62, will ever get that chance? Back on the field at Wrigley, the shadows grew long, and I asked Jones why so few blacks and Latinos get the chance to manage. He looked me in the eyes. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a question that I really can\u2019t answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of getting the opportunity, you know what I mean?\u201d I nodded.

["sports/football", "Anthem Demonstrations Include a Show of Unity in Cleveland - The New York Times Members of the Cleveland Browns and law enforcement agents and emergency workers ran onto the field together and locked arms during the national anthem on Sunday before the team\u2019s first game of the season, defusing tension over earlier protests by some Browns players during the song. The gesture suggested that, for the second season, what N.F.L. players do during the anthem will be a focal point as several continue demonstrations started last year by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt several times during the anthem to draw attention to racial oppression and police abuse of black people. Kaepernick left the 49ers in the spring when it appeared he would be cut and is now a free agent. He has not been signed by any franchise, stirring debate over whether teams have refused to hire him because of his politics, or if his skills, which took the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2013, do not measure up. Civil rights groups and activists have protested against the league and called for boycotts. As was the case in the preseason, a handful of demonstrations occurred around the league on and off the field on Sunday. Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett, who last week accused the police in Las Vegas of excessive force and racially profiling him after mistakenly detaining him in connection with a report of gunfire there, sat during the national anthem before a game against the Packers in Green Bay."]

["sports/football", "The league commissioner, Roger Goodell, has sought a middle ground, declaring his support for the anthem while saying players have a right to voice their opinions. He said there was no coordinated effort to block Kaepernick but offered no explanation for why teams had talked to but ultimately bypassed Kaepernick, saying, \u201cI\u2019m no football expert.\u201d The N.F.L. for years has injected patriotic themes into its games, often including flag-waving and the military in ceremonies. Nearly three-quarters of the players in the league are black, and some of the most prominent players, including Bennett of the Seahawks, have said that they sit during the anthem to raise awareness of social injustice, as a form of patriotism beyond honoring the flag. The show of unity in Cleveland came after several Browns knelt in prayer before a preseason game, prompting police officers and rescue workers\u2019 unions, which often participate in pregame ceremonies, to issue statements objecting to anthem protests and threatening to refuse to hold the flag during the anthem ceremony on Sunday.

["living", "VIEW; 'Survivor' for Stardom - The New York Times ABC had a winner last summer with ''Making the Band,'' which tracked the manufacturing of an actual boy group called O-Town. The members were cast according to the standard boy-band blueprint: the golden boy, the hottie, the bad boy, the shy guy, at least one  ''ethnic type.'' In the end there were five insta-idols chosen from auditions of thousands -- it was ''Survivor'' set to music, only with much lower odds. O-Town's first single, ''Liquid Dreams,'' had its debut at Billboard's No. 1 sales spot in December (a first for a new artist); 13 new episodes of ''Making the Band'' are slated to start April 13 (ABC, 8 p.m.); and the boys have become a sensation, appearing on the cover of this month's YM. But in the meantime, my friends and I were craving an attachment to a fresh bunch of talented and doomed young adults. So the January premiere of the WB's ''Popstars'' (now showing on Fridays at 8:30 p.m. and setting WB ratings records for teenage girls) was great news. Call it ''Making the Girl Band'': we would watch thousands whittled down to five who hoped to be the next Spice Girls. The formula has been proven in Australia, where the ''Popstars'' show produced a girl group called Bardot that went on to make a No. 1 hit single and album; in Japan it spawned a group called Morning Mesume, with just as much success."]
["living", "On our big night, I brought wine, my friend Betsy made tapenade, and our group of six (we gals and four guys, all in our late 20's to early 30's) settled down to watch. We figured we'd get the same blend of kitsch and real sentiment that had made us possibly the world's oldest living O-Town devotees. Instead, we found ourselves watching a giant pleather car wreck. We'd skidded from the thrill of male victory to the agony of female defeat. Who had thought the boys' show would be about bonding and the girls' show about rivalry? Like ''Making the Band,'' ''Popstars'' begins with nationwide open auditions. But ''Making the Band,''  produced by the creators of MTV's ''Real World,'' tactfully fast-forwarded to its semifinal group of 25. (Only one auditioner was a disaster, and only goofily so.) The first episode of ''Popstars,'' by contrast, gapes at the spectacularly tuneless, soulless and hopeless. Mousy murmurers, screamers in sequins, a scarecrow blonde who danced, deadpan, like someone making fun of someone with no rhythm. In a stunning single-entendre, En Vogue's ''Never gonna get it, never gonna get it'' played over their painful efforts. Yeow. And it continued. ''Popstars'' devoted five episodes to the cutthroat auditions, where dreams were dashed by a team of judges (a celebrity choreographer, a talent manager, a record executive and the producer who unleashed Celine Dion)."]
["living", "In Episode 4, the ''Heathers'' factor is highest as 20 remaining hopefuls are shipped to a studio in Los Angeles, where the audition process intensifies as they must quickly learn and perform new dances and songs. We see contestants cracking under pressure: girls sprawl, dazed, on couches, or hunch over in tears. One auditioner, a single mother named Nikki McKibbin, tells the camera how another girl tried to mislead her. ''She said I'm going home because the two lead spots had already been filled and I'm too good to do backup. I was like, 'Did you actually just say that to me?' '' Another tearful hopeful says: ''Everyone's making it so difficult! Why can't you just be normal? Stop trying to show off and make everyone else feel bad.'' And in Episode 7, once we see the five selected girls get settled into their Los Angeles house and work on their first single in the recording studio, discord swells over which of the girls' voices will be featured on the track. At least the narration tells us it does (''There are bruised egos, there is rivalry among the girls''), but we see only a moment or two of a testy conversation around the dining table, suggesting that the conflict (much like the single) is enhanced in post-production."]
["living", "It's not all catfighting and rumor-mongering. The girls have many supportive moments, such as when they console the losers. But the structure and tone of the show seem to scrutinize the contestants from a distance rather than allowing us to understand them, much less like them. All we really get to know, thanks to the portentous narration -- ''the girls struggle with their nerves and face the competition'' -- is that the audition process is, like, stressful. My friends and I wondered: How come the boy show was all warm and the girl show was turning out mean? As Colin Lingle, 33, a Web consultant, put it: ''Why is the lasting image of 'Making the Band' a big group hug, and on 'Popstars' it's an isolated girl squealing while another walks down a lonely hallway?'' Maybe -- in the words of the bona fide pop star Christina Aguilera (and every third ''Popstars'' auditioner) -- it's ''What a Girl Wants.'' According to their producers, both shows are geared toward teenage girls, and are about packaging their fantasies: dating a pop star or being one. When it comes to the former, ''we don't care who wins the game; we want to know which one will be our boyfriend,'' said Marcelle Karp, co-founding editor of Bust magazine."]
["living", "Sure enough, by Episode 2, the eight finalists in ''Making the Band'' were already installed in their supercool house -- complete with weight rooms and musical equipment -- in Orlando, Fla., to play and bond until the final five were selected. Beneath their differences, each fit the Frankenstar formula: equal parts hot and nice, your boyfriend and your gay friend. They wear towels while ironing. They visit their moms. As a result, by Episode 3, the target viewer is already doodling her daydreamy new hyphenated surname. But when it comes to ''Popstars,'' the viewers are not looking for a boyfriend, they're looking in a mirror -- a slimming one? The message is that success is not about skill but about packaging. The bases for comparison or identification are mainly limited to weight (thin wins) and volume (loud wins too). The structure is like a pageant, where the judges make inscrutable choices and the viewers get only a snakeskin-deep sense of what the contestants are like (as in this narration: ''Bea Talplacido is wearing her good luck tube top, which she bought for $3''). ''It's common in pop culture to portray women in competition with other women for men or success,'' said Sharon Mazzarella, co-editor of ''Growing Up Girls: Popular Culture and the Construction of Identity'' (1999). ''But not the healthy kind we see men learning and growing and developing self-esteem from.''"]
["living", "By the time the winners were selected (seen four weeks ago), we were down to only two types of role models (emphasis on ''model''). Turns out four of the five pop stars -- Nicole Scherzinger, 22, Rosanna Tavarez, 23, Ana Maria Lombo, 22, and Maile Misajon, 24 -- are, despite their mixed ethnic backgrounds, virtually indistinguishable, all with fine features and straight black hair. Ivette Sosa, 24, a strawberry blonde of Puerto Rican descent, seemed to be the exception, but by the time the first publicity photo appeared, stylists had ironed out her ringlets. Another problem is that ''Popstars,'' for all its attention to the competition among the women, condescends to them by portraying the music industry as a fairy tale place to realize their dreams, failing to address the cruel realities of show business. ''Making the Band'' manages to tell both a warm story and the cold truth that a pop star is fabricated and expendable. When O-Town shows up late for rehearsal, the vocal coach warns, ''You can be replaced. Quickly.'' A handler puts one kid in his place by saying, ''You are not a star -- you are a lab rat.'' Couldn't ''Popstars'' suggest that girls could handle both the competition and the real truth about what they're in for and up against? Still, girl viewers are eating ''Popstars'' up. Heck, I'm hooked already. Three episodes ago, they at last came up with a name for the band. The American ''Popstars'' will be called -- ta-da! -- Eden's Crush. If they'd called the group Stepford, I'd have taken all this back."]
["us", "Marijuana Industry Presses Ahead in California\u2019s Wine Country - The New York Times SANTA ROSA, Calif. \u2014 In the heart of Northern California\u2019s wine country, a civil engineer turned marijuana entrepreneur is adding a new dimension to the art of matching fine wines with gourmet food: cannabis and wine pairing dinners. Sam Edwards, co-founder of the Sonoma Cannabis Company, charges diners $100 to $150 for a meal that experiments with everything from marijuana-leaf pesto sauce to sniffs of cannabis flowers paired with sips of a crisp Russian River chardonnay. \u201cIt accentuates the intensity of your palate,\u201d Mr. Edwards, 30, said of the dinners, one of which was held recently at a winery with sweeping views of the Sonoma vineyards. \u201cWe are seeing what works and what flavors are coming out.\u201d Sonoma County, known to the world for its wines, is these days a seedbed of cannabis experimentation. The approval of recreational cannabis use by California voters in November has spurred local officials here to embrace the pot industry and the tax income it may bring. \u201cWe\u2019re making this happen,\u201d said Julie Combs, a member of the Santa Rosa City Council, who is helping lead an effort to issue permits to cannabis companies. \u201cThis is an industry that can really help our region.\u201d Of the many ways in which California is on a collision course with the Trump administration, from immigration to the environment, the state\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of legalized and regulated marijuana may be one of the biggest tests of the federal government\u2019s power."]
["us", "Attorney General Jeff Sessions has equated marijuana with heroin and, on Wednesday, mentioned cannabis in the context of the \u201cscourge of drug abuse.\u201d \u201cI reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana, so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that\u2019s only slightly less awful.\u201d To the ears of many in California and other states where marijuana use has been legalized to varying degrees, the stigma Mr. Sessions attaches to cannabis feels like a holdover from the distant past. Marijuana, which has been legal for medicinal purposes in California for two decades, can be ordered online for home delivery in the state\u2019s largest cities. A former mayor of Oakland, Jean Quan, recently applied to open a marijuana dispensary in San Francisco. The industry is already immense. Arcview, a company that conducts cannabis research, estimates that the California market alone is worth $7 billion. America\u2019s divided views on cannabis have produced a strange and uneasy stalemate. Recreational use is legal in eight states, including all those along the West Coast. At the same time, state governments are watching closely for hints on what the Trump administration plans to do. In the past, the federal authorities have destroyed fields and prosecuted growers. Federal law still calls for a minimum prison sentence of five years for growing more than 100 marijuana plants, although under the Obama administration, the law was enforced only in cases involving violence or gangs."]
["us", "The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, recently warned of the possibility of \u201cgreater enforcement\u201d against recreational use of marijuana. Those working in the industry are constantly reminded of the federal government\u2019s power to intervene in their business dealings, including severely limiting their access to the banking system. \u201cThey can come in and ruin your whole life,\u201d said Mr. Edwards, the marijuana entrepreneur. \u201cThey can throw you in prison, take your property.\u201d Yet, like so many others in the cannabis industry here \u2014 there are an estimated 9,000 growers in Sonoma County \u2014 Mr. Edwards is pressing ahead with his company, which specializes in growing and selling pesticide-free cannabis products. And he is planning more cannabis and wine pairing dinners. \u201cHistory favors the bold,\u201d he said. His business\u2019s name, Sonoma Cannabis Company, makes no attempt to hide what industry he is in. Some are skeptical that the Trump administration has the wherewithal to carry out a widespread crackdown on such a huge industry in America\u2019s most prosperous state. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of doubtful right now, looking at the Trump administration,\u201d said Terry Garrett, a manager at Sustaining Technologies, a marketing company that researches the cannabis market in Sonoma County. \u201cLet\u2019s see them do health care first, round up immigrants, build a wall.\u201d Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, a cannabis industry group, said the mood among growers was a mixture of excitement and anxiety. Their primary concerns at the moment have more to do with local tax rates than possible federal intervention, he said."]
["us", "A ballot measure that passed this month in Sonoma clears the way for the county to issue permits, a big step in bringing the industry out of the shadows. The policy, known as Measure A, favors small-scale artisanal growers by taxing the acreage under cultivation rather than tonnage and by charging lower rates for smaller plots. But it also gives the county wide latitude to raise taxes without further voter approval.

''You can give a problem a million dollars,'' he likes to say, ''but that won't make it go away.'' Mr. Beltre, a 35-year-old Bronx resident who has manic depression and bipolar disorder, has found ways to live a productive life despite his mental illness. ''I overcame my depression through a lot of hard work,'' he said, ''and by setting goals for myself that I'm now achieving.'' A native New Yorker, Mr. Beltre said his problems began when he went to Boston College in 1984 on an academic grant that covered one year's tuition. After that, he could no longer afford to go, and had to come home and live with his parents. ''I loved Boston College,'' he said. ''I had so many friends there, but after a while, I barely had enough in my pockets to go and see a movie.'' In 1986, Mr. Beltre enrolled at the City College of the City University of New York. Two years later, he took a leave of absence to work as an activities coordinator for Club Med. ''That was one of the best things I ever did in my life,'' he said. ''I got to see places like Florida, the Bahamas and Martinique, places I could never afford to see now.'' By 1992, Mr. Beltre was back in New York and living on his own."]

I didn't have that bachelor's degree I needed, either, and the whole thing just started to get me down.'' Unhappy with who he was and with everything he had not achieved, he went from job to job, unable to get his life on track. ''My thoughts just became incoherent, and I couldn't sleep at night,'' he said. ''I was an overachiever who wanted to do more things in life, and I became frustrated and hyperactive.'' Mr. Beltre began getting therapy and taking medication. In 1998, he found a job he liked, earning $15 a hour as an electrician at a Manhattan hotel. By January 2000, however, Mr. Beltre said his mental state began deteriorating again. ''I was disgusted with it, and determined to beat it,'' he said. ''I recognized my symptoms, so I took myself to a hospital and went from there.'' Mr. Beltre said that he spent one month in the hospital but that by the time he was able to work again, he had lost his hotel job, and began falling behind on his rent. Then came a number of frustrating months as Mr. Beltre tried catching up on his rent, which is $720 a month. He used up his savings and worked whenever or wherever possible to make at least partial rent payments on his one-bedroom apartment just blocks from Fordham University in the Bronx."]

Mr. Beltre got a $2,000 loan from Social Security, and managed to earn an additional $1,100. The remaining $500 was provided in February by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

["international/asia", "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE HUNT; MARINES AND ARMY MAY SCOUR CAVES, U.S. GENERAL SAYS - The New York Times Frustrated by the failure to capture Osama bin Laden, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan has proposed that United States marines or Army troops be deployed to comb the wild terrain of Tora Bora to try to determine the fate of Al Qaeda leaders, American officials said today. The proposal, presented to the Pentagon by Gen. Tommy R. Franks, head of the United States Central Command, stems from the recognition that the Afghan allies may not have the ability or the will to establish control over Tora Bora, an untamed and dangerous region that borders Pakistan. A United States defense official in Washington declined to say how many marines or other American ground forces would be involved, but another person familiar with the discussions said it could involve ''several hundred'' troops. One of their tasks could be to dig their way into blown-up caves in search of clues about Mr. bin Laden. American military officials said that the Pentagon was still assessing the risks, but that a final decision might come in several days, and the first troops could arrive soon after. Dispatching significant numbers of Marine and Army forces would considerably aid the effort to search the ridges and valleys of Tora Bora. But it would also expand the risk to Americans from sniper attacks, land mines and booby traps."]
["international/asia", "It could also entail political complications. In northern Afghanistan, Northern Alliance forces have bragged about the support they have received form the Americans as a badge of respect. But in this conservative Pashtun region of Afghanistan, senior commanders routinely refuse to acknowledge help they receive from American Special Forces. Suspicion of Americans runs so strong that some American reporters try to hide their nationalities. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, speaking in Washington, made no reference to General Franks's confidential proposal today. But he indicated that he had received assurances from Hamid Karzai, the Afghan leader who will formally take charge of the provisional government on Saturday, that the American military could continue to operate in Afghanistan until the last ''pockets of resistance'' had been eliminated. ''Our goal is to stop them,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, ''not simply move the problem into other countries.'' The military campaign has toppled the Taliban and destroyed Al Qaeda's network of terrorist training camps. But it has not provided the closure that many Americans are yearning for: the capture or death of Mr. bin Laden, the man the Bush administration and the vast majority of Americans blame for Sept. 11. American military officials have said that communication intercepts indicated that Mr. bin Laden had probably been personally directing the defense of Tora Bora. Al Qaeda prisoners here have also told their Afghan captors that Mr. bin Laden was seen in the area late last week."]
["international/asia", "But American intelligence information about the location of Mr. bin Laden recently came to an abrupt and mysterious end, officials said.  That has led intelligence experts to infer that he was killed in an air strike or fled to Pakistan. It has also added to the pressure to send American troops to sort out the situation. ''We have nothing new on him,'' a senior military official said. ''There are no new signs of his activity. There are two main theories now. Some think he was blown to kingdom come and is buried in one of the caves or tunnels we took out. Others say it is more likely that he escaped. We are trying to gain clarity in a situation that has no clarity.'' Certainly, the Afghan fighters who currently patrol the area may not resolve the mystery. Until now the task of searching the mountains and ravines here has been entrusted to fighters from the Eastern Shura, a regional government that is the source of three different and sometimes antagonistic forces. About 50 United States Special Operations troops have been working with anti-Taliban forces or operating independently in the Tora Bora area to cut off Al Qaeda fighters trying to flee to Pakistan. Some British commandos are also deployed. But on Sunday some Afghan commanders signaled that they considered the war to be largely over now that Tora Bora is back in their hands and that the search for Mr. bin Laden was a secondary mission."]
["international/asia", "At times, some of the Afghan groups also seem more preoccupied with internal feuds than with tracking down the arch-enemy of the United States. On Tuesday, fighters for Cmdr. Hajji Zahir rushed from their command post deep in the Tora Bora mountains after being alerted that men from Cmdr. Muhammad Zaman's faction was trying to make their way home from a patrol by crossing through Commander Zahir's turf. The tension was high and at times it seemed that a firefight between factions might erupt. The task of tracking down Mr. bin Laden is also inherently difficult. If the terrorist leader is entombed in a cave, combat engineers may be needed to dig out the body. General Franks said in a television interview on Sunday that the United States might not be able to find some Al Qaeda leaders without excavating the bombed-out caves. ''Well, it'll be a question mark until we decide whether we want to go in and dig these bunkers and caves out,'' he said. ''And in some cases, we may well do that.'' A senior defense official said in Washington said that deploying American troops would also send a message that the United States is continuing the hunt for Mr. bin Laden. ''There are a whole lot of caves up there,'' the official said, referring to Tora Bora, ''and we're looking at what resources you might need to get the job done. The X-factor in all of this is to continue to make clear with the anti-Taliban forces that we're just as committed as ever to following through with our objectives.''"]
["international/asia", "Under the proposal by General Franks, marines could be drawn from their bases near Kandahar, in the southeast, and soldiers could be summoned from the Army's 10th Mountain Division, which is deployed in Uzbekistan and at the Bagram air base, north of Kabul. Other soldiers might be drawn from the Army's 101st Airborne Division, which is guarding bases the United States is using in Pakistan. There are about 2,000 marines in Afghanistan, operating largely from the Kandahar International Airport, 12 miles south of the city. Until recently, they had set up roadblocks on the outskirts of Kandahar in an effort to block Taliban forces from trying to escape. A Marine Expeditionary Unit of 2,200 is to arrive in the North Arabian Sea in the coming weeks, to join the two units already there or ashore in Afghanistan. ''We will use what we need, but there's no anticipation of a major infusion,'' said a defense official. During the war, General Franks has suggested that he would dispatch troops to hot spots around the country if they were needed in the hunt for the leaders and fighters of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Senior military officials may also bolster the marines in Kandahar to begin attacking pockets of resistance in the south, and perhaps broaden the hunt for Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader. After punishing air attacks and assaults by Afghan fighters, hundreds of Al Qaeda members have sought to flee to Pakistan."]
["international/asia", "Today, captured fighters in Pakistan grabbed weapons from their guards and tried to escape, leaving at least 13 people dead, Pakistani government spokesmen said. Seven prisoners and six guards were said to have died in the revolt and Pakistani troops were pursuing as many as 40 other prisoners who had fled into the surrounding countryside during the mayhem. The rebelling prisoners were among about 100 fighters captured early today and late Tuesday as they fled, government officials said. The fighters, mostly non-Afghans, were being transported by bus and truck from a makeshift detention center near Parachinar, in western Pakistan, to a prison in Kohat, the government said. A prisoner seized a guard's weapon and other prisoners joined an attempt to take over one of the buses. ''In the ensuing melee, the bus carrying 48 Al Qaeda men careened off the winding road near Arawali village in Kurram Agency and fell 20 feet down,'' the Pakistan government said. The government said the fighters exchanged gunfire with the security forces and escaped into the surrounding hills and forests. Army helicopters and Special Forces troops were brought in for the pursuit and most prisoners were recaptured within hours, officials said. Today, Secretary Rumsfeld said Pakistani forces along the mountainous border had captured hundreds of non-Afghan Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters fleeing Afghanistan in the past few days.

Mr. Rumsfeld also sought to dispel a report that a German official had said the United States would focus its antiterror campaign on Somalia next, calling the report ''nonsense.'' And he sought to put the best face on the frustrating and so far fruitless search for Mr. bin Laden: ''He's either dug in some tunnel, or he's alive.

["world/asia", "Navy Ships Kept at Sea Despite Training and Maintenance Needs, Admiral Says - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 After a string of deadly accidents in the western Pacific, a top admiral acknowledged on Thursday that the Navy had knowingly operated warships there despite a growing number of major training and maintenance shortfalls \u2014 all to meet increasing operational demands. An unusual hearing of two House Armed Services subcommittees offered no new information about what caused four Navy mishaps in the western Pacific this year, including two fatal collisions between Navy destroyers and foreign cargo ships that left 17 sailors dead. Those accidents remain under investigation. But the hearing painted a disturbing portrait of fatigued crews and commanders on a shrinking overseas fleet saddled with constant deployments \u2014 including confronting an expansionist Chinese military and keeping vigil on a nuclear saber-rattling North Korea \u2014 with little time left to train or to repair aging ships. \u201cThe Navy is caught between unrelenting demands and a shortage of ships,\u201d John H. Pendleton, a director of the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, told lawmakers. The office has chronicled the Navy\u2019s woes in several recent reports. Contrite Navy officials conceded that they had accepted increasing risks with uncertified ships and crews, despite repeated warnings from congressional watchdogs and the Navy\u2019s own experts. In case after case, Navy ship commanders and their chains of command approved waivers to expiring certifications of standards so long as temporary steps were put in place to mitigate the risks."]
["world/asia", "\u201cWe have allowed standards to drop as the number of certifications has grown,\u201d said Adm. William F. Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, referring to waivers of required tests certifying Navy crews and ships had met certain standards, such as seamanship. As of June, 37 percent of the certifications for the crews of cruisers and destroyers based at the Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan, had expired, Mr. Pendleton said. That was more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired certifications for the crews of those ships since a Government Accountability Office report in May 2015, he said. Thursday\u2019s hearing marked the first time that Navy officials publicly responded to Congress since the destroyer John S. McCain collided last month with an oil tanker off the coast of Singapore, killing 10 sailors. In June, the destroyer Fitzgerald collided with a cargo ship off Japan. Seven sailors died in their flooded berthing compartments. After the McCain crash, the Navy relieved the commander of the Seventh Fleet, Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin; directed all 277 Navy ships worldwide to suspend operations for a day or two to examine basic seamanship and teamwork; and ordered a comprehensive review of fleet operations, training and manning to be completed within 60 days. Lawmakers, however, seemed unsatisfied that the Navy was taking enough immediate measures to prevent another accident, and demanded to know why the Navy did not pause its operations after the Fitzgerald crash. \u201cIt should have,\u201d Admiral Moran said."]
["world/asia", "Much of the hearing focused on the differences between Navy ships based in the United States and those overseas. Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based abroad. That allows the Navy to respond quickly in a crisis with a formidable number of combatant ships and aircraft. The Seventh Fleet is the Navy\u2019s biggest and busiest, with 20,000 sailors and 50 to 70 vessels. Even as the Navy has shrunk, its missions have grown to meet demands in a region that has become increasingly unstable. In the past two decades, the number of Navy ships has decreased about 20 percent, though the time they are deployed has remained the same, according to a 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington research group funded by the Defense Department. The increased burden has fallen disproportionately on the Seventh Fleet. That tempo, Admiral Moran acknowledged Thursday, has frayed readiness. Government and military investigators have drawn similar conclusions, warning that the mission pace was leaving crews unprepared. Mr. Pendleton noted that a 2015 study by the Government Accountability Office found that the high demands of Navy fleets based overseas, like the Seventh in Japan, affect maintenance and training. Investigators found that ships spent so much time at sea that there was not enough time for routine preventive repairs. And they said that while crews based in the United States were almost always completely qualified before deploying, ships based overseas and juggling multiple missions relied on a \u201ctrain on the margins\u201d approach."]
["world/asia", "\u201cOver all, the negative trend lines associated with the operational readiness of our forward deployed ships are deeply troubling,\u201d said Representative Rob Wittman, Republican of Virginia, who heads the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee. \u201cThese negative training trends clearly contributed to the lack of seamanship evident onboard the U.S.S. John McCain and the U.S.S. Fitzgerald.\u201d Navy officials seemed taken aback by some of these findings, even though alarms have been sounded for years. Admiral Moran, for instance, said he always presumed the Seventh Fleet was one of the Navy\u2019s most proficient because of its vast operational experience. \u201cIt was a wrong assumption,\u201d he said. The admiral said the comprehensive review will address how much risk the Navy can accept to accomplish all its missions in the western Pacific. \u201cWe should not and cannot have collisions at sea,\u201d Admiral Moran told lawmakers. \u201cYou have my promise we\u2019ll get to the bottom of these mishaps.\u201d"]
["upshot", "The Power of Simple Life Changes to Prevent Heart Disease - The New York Times Billions of dollars are spent every year on medications that reduce the risk of heart disease \u2014 the No. 1 killer in the United States. But some people feel powerless to prevent it: Many of the risk factors seem baked into the cake at birth. Genetic factors can have a huge impact on people\u2019s chances of dying of heart disease, and it has long been thought that those factors are almost always outside of one\u2019s control. Recent research contradicts this, though, and that should give us all renewed hope. Since the 1930s, we\u2019ve recognized that heart disease runs in families. For the last decade, we\u2019ve been able to identify specific genes that are linked to coronary artery disease. In fact, these genes seem to have a cumulative effect. People who have more of them are at greater risk. Familial factors are some of the strongest arguments for using drugs like statins widely. After all, there\u2019s only so much you can do about your cholesterol through diet and exercise changes. Some people can see reductions in cholesterol only through pharmacological intervention. Still, we tend to treat those at low risk with lifestyle changes, while those at high risk get more intensive therapy. A new study in The New England Journal of Medicine argues that thinking may be wrong."]
["upshot", "Researchers gathered data from four large prospective cohort studies that followed thousands of people for years, looking at the relationships between various risk factors and heart disease. The first began enrolling patients in 1987 and the last in 2008. Even though specific genes of interest weren\u2019t known when these studies began, data were available that allowed scientists to evaluate genetic risk decades later. Using about 50 different variations \u2014 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (otherwise known as SNPs) \u2014 researchers created a risk score. They also looked at how lifestyle factors were associated with outcomes. These included not smoking cigarettes, not being obese (having a B.M.I. less than 30), performing physical activity at least once a week and having a healthful diet pattern. That last criterion was defined as doing at least half of the following recommendations: eating more fruits, nuts, vegetables, whole grains, fish and dairy products and eating less refined grains, processed meats, unprocessed red meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fats and sodium. Every one of the four lifestyle factors was associated with a decreased risk of coronary events. That\u2019s the first bit of good news. Doing any one of these things makes a difference. But the effect is cumulative. The researchers divided people into three groups based on these factors. \u201cFavorable\u201d required at least three of the four factors, \u201cintermediate\u201d required two of them, and \u201cunfavorable\u201d required one or none. Across all studies, those with an unfavorable lifestyle had a risk that was 71 percent to 121 percent higher than those with a favorable lifestyle."]
["upshot", "More impressive was the reduction in coronary events \u2014 heart attacks, bypass procedures and death from cardiovascular causes \u2014 at every level of risk. Those with a favorable lifestyle, compared with those with an unfavorable lifestyle, had a 45 percent reduction in coronary events among those at low genetic risk, a 47 percent reduction among those with intermediate genetic risk, and a 46 percent reduction among those at high genetic risk. What does this mean in real-world numbers? Among those at high genetic risk in the oldest cohort study, 10.7 percent could expect to have a coronary event over a 10-year period if they had an unfavorable lifestyle. That number was reduced to 5.1 percent if they had a favorable lifestyle. Among those at low genetic risk, the 10-year event rate was 5.8 percent with an unfavorable lifestyle and 3.1 percent with a favorable lifestyle. In the other cohort studies, similar relative reductions were seen. These differences aren\u2019t small. The risk of a coronary event in 10 years was halved. The absolute reduction, more than 5 percentage points in the genetic group at high risk, means that lifestyle changes are as powerful as, if not more powerful than, many drugs we recommend and pay billions of dollars for all the time. There are caveats, of course. All of the participants in these analyses were white, because there are few well-validated genetic studies in black populations. But the researchers also saw similar findings in the black population of the oldest cohort. These aren\u2019t randomized controlled trials, and there could be other factors at play that we aren\u2019t measuring. But the results were consistent over a number of studies, and the effect size is large."]
["upshot", "There are important lessons to be learned. These results should encourage us that genetics do not determine everything about our health. Changes in lifestyle can overcome much of the risk our DNA imposes. Lifestyle changes are hugely important not only for those at low risk, but for those at high risk. The relative reductions in events were similar at all levels of genetic risk. Moreover, given how changes in lifestyle will also reduce your risk of other diseases like cancer (the No. 2 killer), it\u2019s clear that a healthier lifestyle could have huge implications for many, many more people. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that these lifestyle recommendations are even less constrictive than those I\u2019ve discussed in the past. You need only be a current nonsmoker; past smoking doesn\u2019t exclude you. You can also be overweight, just not obese. And in contrast with most physical activity recommendations, it requires only once-a-week exercise, not the 30 minutes for five days that most professional organizations like the American Heart Association endorse."]

Unmoved by his client, Spenser seems bored silly by a plot that calls for him to investigate the dead banker's shady business associates, who have a morbid tendency to cash in their own chips the minute he's out the door. Which is not to say that Spenser doesn't have some priceless moments just being Spenser. When a puffed-up bank C.E.O. asks, ''Who the hell are you?'' the P.I. goes right to the heart of ''the metaphysical question about human identity'' by replying, ''Who are any of us?'' And apropos of nothing at all, he decides that he hates digital clocks. Why? Because ''nice phrases like 'quarter to three' were becoming obsolete.'' But it's a tip-off to the trouble he's in that so few of these bons mots are inspired by the dull characters in this misbegotten book."]
["books", "If you can overlook the victims' severed pinkie fingers -- grisly souvenirs taken by a serial killer running footloose in Georgetown -- Robert Andrews's low-key police procedural A MURDER OF PROMISE (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95) is a thoughtful, discreetly told tale about the abuses of power. In their second outing (after ''A Murder of Honor''), the veteran homicide detectives Frank Kearney and Jos\u00e9 Phelps look for motive in the killing of Mary Keegan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was working on a ''generational biography'' about a Kennedy-era political dynasty. Finding none, they credit the homicide to a roving psychopath. Although Andrews gives short shrift to the forensic procedures for tracking mad-dog killers, his lead detective, the intelligent and thoroughly decent Kearney, is someone you want to watch in an interview. Going face to face with politicians, crime bosses and other Washington power brokers, he can read the minds of successful fathers and the sons who disappoint them. Spring has sprung in Crozet, the bucolic town in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where Rita Mae Brown sets the cozy mysteries she whimsically populates with talking animals -- and whose authorship she graciously shares with her own cat. In CATCH AS CAT CAN (Bantam, $24.95), Crozet's eccentric citizens are so caught up in the social whirl attending the annual Dogwood Festival that they ignore such unnatural events as the demise of a giant pileated woodpecker and the theft of the hubcaps on the widow Hogendobber's 1961 Ford Falcon. But when the rites of spring turn to murder, Mary Minor (Harry) Haristeen, the town postmaster and resident sleuth, is moved to investigate. Unlike Harry, who is only human and therefore oblivious of the urgently articulated advice of her house pets, readers are privy to their commentary, especially that of Mrs. Murphy, a bossy tiger cat who proves cleverer than the entire voting population of Crozet."]

But outside on East 62nd Street stood people, some in tears, who had never met the man who survived the Holocaust to become a clarion voice for those victims who did not. \u201cHe was someone who protected us; he interceded against our worst instincts,\u201d Sarah Bardin, 44, a preschool teacher who had come to pay her respects, said as she cried. She knew Mr. Wiesel, who died on Saturday at 87, only through his prolific writing. His works, including the memoir \u201cNight,\u201d gave voice to the Jews murdered during World War II and demanded they never be forgotten. Without him, Ms. Bardin said, the world felt like a more vulnerable place. Inside the Orthodox Fifth Avenue Synagogue, about 100 people attended a ceremony that not only reflected Mr. Wiesel as a man of extraordinary scholarship and influence who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his life\u2019s work, but also remembered him as a friend, a mentor, a husband, a father, a grandfather. In a wheelchair, his widow, Marion, listened as Mr. Wiesel was eulogized by his son Elisha, a partner at Goldman Sachs. He spoke of what it was like growing up with a man of such stature but who still had time for unconditional love. A young grandson, Elijah, spoke of sharing simple moments with a man who was a moral titan to many. Elijah recalled the fun of making English muffins together, smothered in blueberry jam."]

He spoke of how funny Mr. Wiesel was, and of their decades-long friendship that was spent finding ways to make each other laugh. \u201cIt made clear his love of the Jewish people extended to all mankind,\u201d Menachem Rosensaft, a friend of over 50 years, said of the service. Mr. Rosensaft, a professor of law at Columbia and Cornell, said he had been a teaching assistant for Mr. Wiesel when he taught at City College in New York beginning in the 1970s. In attendance was Sheila Johnson Robbins, a member of the board of the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, the organization he started to promote understanding among ethnic groups in conflict. \u201cHe gave us the sense of responsibility, to follow in his footsteps, and continue his mission \u2014 to never forget,\u201d she said after the service. \u201cAnd everyone is thinking of him as a thinker, a writer,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was also a man \u2014 he loved chocolate!\u201d Around noon, the coffin with Mr. Wiesel\u2019s body was wheeled from the synagogue surrounded by a dozen mourners, a simple pine box that is customary in Jewish funerals, a blue velvet cloth draped over it.

["science", "Space Shuttle Atlantis Touches Down in California - The New York Times EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- Space shuttle Atlantis and its crew landed in the Mojave Desert on Tuesday after three straight days of bad weather prevented the ship from returning to its Florida home port. Atlantis glided through a hazy sky and touched down at 12:33 p.m. -- 13 days after lifting off for the International Space Station. During the mission, the five astronauts delivered and installed a $1.4 billion laboratory that is considered the most sophisticated research module ever to fly in space. ``Welcome back to Earth after placing our Destiny in space,'' Mission Control said, referring to the new laboratory. Thick, low clouds kept Atlantis from touching down at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Tuesday. On the previous two days, the problem was gusty wind. The weather was OK at Edwards Air Force Base, the backup landing site, and Mission Control gave the go-ahead for the astronauts to finally come down. They had just one more day's worth of fuel and supplies. ``Pass to all the folks down at KSC and our families there that we're sorry we won't see them right away, but we appreciate it making it home somewhere today,'' shuttle commander Kenneth Cockrell told Mission Control. Space shuttle landings are infrequent at Edwards, which served as the main touchdown site until the early 1990s. The last shuttle landing at Edwards was in October. The last one before that was in 1996."]
["science", "An Edwards landing requires the shuttle to be ferried back to Florida atop a modified Boeing 747 at a cost of nearly $1 million. Because of the weather delays, Cockrell and his crew spent two days circling Earth with little to do except gaze at Earth, snap pictures and exercise on a stationary cycle. During their one week at space station Alpha, the astronauts delivered and then hooked up NASA's most expensive piece of the space station, the Destiny laboratory. Three spacewalks were needed to install the lab, hang a shutter on its porthole -- the finest optical-quality window ever built into a spacecraft -- and attach other gear to the space station. It will be another few weeks before Destiny gets any science experiments; space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off March 8 with the first batch. But already, the computer-filled lab module is controlling the steering of the space station and saving precious rocket-thruster fuel. With the addition of Destiny, Alpha now has more live-in space than any of the world's previous space stations. The space station stretches 171 feet in length, 28 feet longer than before. The next major component to fly to the space station, in April, is the Canadian-built robot arm. An American-made airlock, a pressure-change room for spacewalkers, is supposed to go up in June. At least two more laboratories, supplied by the Europeans and Japanese, are to be delivered before space station construction ends in 2006."]

Regulars at the World Economic Forum know him as the politically connected insider who organizes an annual wine tasting party in the Swiss Alps. President Trump knows him as a major Wall Street fund-raiser with hopes of joining the administration. But as Anthony Scaramucci presided over his annual SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, at the Bellagio Las Vegas hotel this week, he was not quite any of these things. Mr. Scaramucci sold his stake in SkyBridge Capital, his hedge fund of funds business, early this year, leaving him without a financial institution to his name. His hoped-for job in the Trump administration did not materialize. And an effort to disentangle himself from his business wound up raising conflict-of-interest questions. On Thursday, William A. Ackman, the billionaire investor who has had a two-year losing streak, described how he was \u201cextremely humbled\u201d by his losses. Mr. Scaramucci, who was interviewing him, said he empathized. \u201cUnfortunately, I have been there,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. The lack of a clearly defined role did not stop Mr. Scaramucci, known as the Mooch, from continuing to angle for a role in the White House. \u201cI am ready to serve,\u201d he said in opening remarks at SALT on Wednesday. \u201cAnd so, to the extent the president needs me, I will be available to him.\u201d"]
["business/dealbook", "In the absence of a new job, Mr. Scaramucci, in a rambling confessional before hundreds of hedge fund insiders, offered hints about his future. \u201cI remain loyal to the president and to the cause,\u201d he said, telling a story about shaking hands with people at a Trump rally in Albuquerque and learning about the economic desperation many Americans face. \u201cIt took a billionaire who lives in a tower on Fifth Avenue next to the Tiffany\u2019s jewelry store to show me something that I missed from my own neighborhood,\u201d he said, referring to his upbringing on Long Island, which he has described as a blue-collar community. Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s state of limbo is a stark turnaround for a man who, just months ago, seemed to be on the fast track to a senior role in the Trump administration. \u201cAnthony is an entrepreneur and a good man,\u201d said Leon G. Cooperman, a hedge fund manager. \u201cHe professionalized the industry, and SALT is the highlight of the industry.\u201d Mr. Cooperman, who has addressed SALT panels in previous years but was not at the conference this year, said Mr. Scaramucci \u201cwould have been a good addition to the administration\u201d but added that Mr. Trump \u201chas already appointed many intelligent people.\u201d Mr. Scaramucci, 53, did not reply to requests for comment. In what has become industry lore, he transformed SkyBridge from a small seeding business on the brink of failure to a large fund of funds by buying Citigroup\u2019s hedge fund business in early 2010, as the bank was trying to shed risky assets."]
["business/dealbook", "A longtime Republican donor, Mr. Scaramucci supported a handful candidates, including Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, in the presidential primaries last year. Along the way, he accused Mr. Trump of being a \u201chack politician\u201d who had a \u201cbig mouth.\u201d Mr. Trump had equally tart words for hedge fund managers, who he said were \u201cpaper pushers\u201d who were \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201d But as Mr. Trump\u2019s unlikely candidacy gained steam, Mr. Scaramucci began to defend him. At last year\u2019s SALT conference, he hosted Steven T. Mnuchin, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman and now the Treasury secretary. Mr. Scaramucci arranged meet-and-greets between Mr. Mnuchin and some of the billionaire hedge fund managers in attendance. The men also shared a meal with Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund and other conference speakers. Mr. Griffin contributed $100,000 to President Trump\u2019s inauguration. Mr. Scaramucci raised significant sums for the Trump campaign and joined his inaugural committee. He said he was offered a job in the White House on Jan. 12. On Jan. 17, he announced that he had sold his stake in SkyBridge to a consortium led by HNA Capital and RON Transatlantic. As part of that sale, the SALT conference affiliated with SkyBridge was spun off to some of his former colleagues. The sale of Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge stake was meant to remove any entanglements that would have prevented him from serving in the administration. But it may have had the opposite effect."]
["business/dealbook", "The timing of the deal raised concerns that the politically connected HNA was currying favor with an incoming White House official. HNA has extensive ties to the Chinese political leadership, The New York Times has reported.

The other buyer of Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s stake in SkyBridge, RON, is linked to a Venezuelan-born banker who was close to the administration of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Bloomberg recently reported. Mr. Scaramucci has said the deal will close and that he has already been paid for his share. But so far, he has been left out of the Trump White House. Instead, Mr. Scaramucci was back in Las Vegas for his ninth SALT event, a conference he started as a way to market his hedge fund firm. This year, the conference had 1,800 participants and speakers, including Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and William A. Ackman, the activist investor. Entertainment included concerts by the Gipsy Kings and Duran Duran. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be here, to be honest,\u201d he said on Wednesday at the opening of the conference. \u201cI was offered a job by the administration.

["books/review", "Get Real - The New York Times To the Editor: Two and a half cheers for Judith Shulevitz for her thoughtful discussion of foreign policy realism (''Expecting the Worst,'' Dec. 16). But her suggestion that such realism threatens to entrap all of our politics in fatalism and determinism is unjustified. True realism holds not only that politics between nations is uncorrectably anarchic but that as a result it differs fundamentally from politics within true nations and states, especially democratically governed ones. Precisely because such domestic systems are characterized by a common acceptance of legitimate authority, and by a broader sense of mutual obligation, a true realist would never disagree that their possibilities for ''trust, cooperation and growth'' are often encouraging. It is precisely because the international system possesses none of these features that realists' expectations of achieving such advances abroad are so low. In fact, by spotlighting the qualitative differences between the international and domestic spheres of politics, true realism can help prevent excessive pessimism in the former -- by observing that foreign policy disappointments and failures have no bearing on our chances for progress at home. That contemporary American realists have not made this argument suggests that they are in fact not realists at all. Alan Tonelson Washington"]
["sports/basketball", "The N.B.A.\u2019s Best Games to Watch as a Streaky Season Comes to an End - The New York Times The triple-double-heavy, upset-happy, injury-prone and largely unpredictable 2016-17 N.B.A. regular season comes to a close on Wednesday. It has been a streaky season, one in which it has often been hard to decide whether a team had genuinely improved or was merely having an excellent month. The Los Angeles Clippers, the Washington Wizards, the Utah Jazz and the Toronto Raptors have all risen and fallen and risen again, while the traditionally dominant teams played possum, suffering through injuries (Kevin Durant, Kevin Love), fatigue and roster shake-ups. Even the inevitably consistent San Antonio Spurs looked a little shaky at home early in the season, and disappointed late, failing to grab the top seed in the West when they had a chance. Now, after several scares apiece, the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers are back on top of their respective conferences and will open the postseason as heavy favorites to return to the Finals for a third straight year. Other teams will see their first-round opponents determined by a final handful of games, still unsure of where they stand despite months of competition. And the best race for the Most Valuable Player Award in recent memory, between the hard-charging Russell Westbrook and the slippery James Harden continues, not to be resolved until the official announcement at an awards show near the end of June. (And even that will not stop the debates.)"]
["sports/basketball", "If the playoffs prove to be as unpredictable as the season, there\u2019s plenty of fun still in store over the next couple of months. But there are still some regular-season threads to tie up. For the last time this season, let\u2019s get into some games. Here\u2019s a look at this week\u2019s complete schedule. Houston at Los Angeles Clippers, Monday, 10:30 p.m., TNT After rushing to grab the top seed in the West at the outset of the season, the Clippers fell off the radar. A combination of injuries and their usual depth issues consigned the blue-and-red to second-tier status in the Western conference. That is no longer the case. The Clippers capped a five-game winning streak with a victory over the Spurs in San Antonio on Saturday. It was only the sixth time the Spurs had given up a game at home since the beginning of December and it marked a reintroduction to the Clippers for those who may have written them off. Los Angeles, which has won nine of its last 11 games, now finds itself neck and neck with the Utah Jazz for the fourth spot in the West. Each team has two games left, and Utah has drawn the short straw of facing the Warriors and the Spurs to end its season. Chances are that the Clippers will clinch home-court advantage, and they could do so as early as Monday. Los Angeles is unlikely to reach the conference finals. But with the Clippers\u2019 experience, balanced starting lineup and defensive toughness, they could prove a tough matchup for the Warriors in the second round."]
["sports/basketball", "Less is at stake for the Rockets. They are locked into the third seed, and will face Oklahoma City in the first round, a fitting opponent for a season in which most of the talk about Houston has centered on James Harden\u2019s competition with Russell Westbrook for most valuable player. Though Westbrook has been at his best recently, Harden remains the safe choice for many experts. As Nick Wright, a contributor to Fox Sports, pointed out on Twitter over the weekend, it would be unprecedented to give the award to a player whose team did not crack 50 wins, or earn a top-four conference seed. Harden will finish the season averaging about 29 points, 11 assists and 8 rebounds per game, one of the best individual seasons of all time. He is a better and more reliable shooter than Westbrook, and gets more assists a game. Most importantly, his team has a serious chance to compete for a title. The Thunder\u2019s postseason \u2014 which will begin in Houston \u2014 is unlikely to last very long. Most fans consider the Rockets to be the only dark horse contender, the only Western team capable of challenging the Spurs, Warriors and Cavaliers. But it is never smart to discount the Clippers. With a win Monday, Los Angeles could signal that, as the playoffs begin, its championship window has not yet closed for good. Oklahoma City at Minnesota, Tuesday, 8 p.m., NBATV"]
["sports/basketball", "Westbrook did it \u2014 he averaged a triple-double for an entire season, the only player to do so other than Oscar Robertson during the 1961-62 season. In his last nine games, Westbrook let forth with a grand finale to cap off a season\u2019s worth of basketball fireworks, averaging 37.2 points, 12.8 rebounds and 10.8 assists a game. He poured in 57 points against the Mavericks, 40 points against the Hornets and 45 against the Grizzlies during that span. On Sunday, he sealed the deal with 50 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists in Denver, breaking Robertson\u2019s record for most triple-doubles in a season with his 42nd while scoring his team\u2019s last 15 points and hitting a game-winning three to eliminate the Nuggets from playoff contention. Atlanta at Indiana, Wednesday, 8 p.m., ESPN Atlanta shocked Cleveland on Sunday, coming back from more than 20 points down in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime and eventually win. The Hawks are now a full game ahead of the Bucks, and will likely be playing the Wizards when the first round commences. For the Pacers, things are still up in the air \u2014 though they occupied the seventh spot Monday morning, they have yet to clinch a playoff berth.

There's as much humor in life as there is chaos and pain, and you expect some of it to seep to the surface, as it does even in many of the most sophisticated and (why not use the word?) ''serious'' 20th-century poets -- not just Larkin but Roethke, Merrill, Wilbur and Auden. Billy Collins, America's new poet laureate, presents a different kind of problem. What are we to make of a poet who's funny almost all the time? Collins is, for sure, a professional charmer. His popular readings and a droll appearance on Garrison Keillor's ''Prairie Home Companion'' have helped his most recent volumes -- Questions About Angels'' (1991), ''The Art of Drowning'' (1995) and ''Picnic, Lightning'' (1998) -- sell tens of thousands of copies. (In the poetry world, those are Harry Potter numbers.) Collins is funny even in interviews, which sounds easy until you've tried it. When he gets tarred with the label ''accessible'' -- only in today's mandarin poetry world, by the way, could that be an insult -- he demurs and says the term calls to mind on-ramps for the ''poetically handicapped.'' He suggests ''hospitable.''"]
["books/review", "Collins's new greatest hits collection, ''Sailing Alone Around the Room,'' is certainly hospitable. There are brainy, observant, spit-shined moments on almost every page. Collins writes like a man with a pile of those poetry refrigerator magnet sets who happened to get pretty handy with them. ''The History Teacher'' opens with a typical slice of Collinsian whimsy: Trying to protect his students' innocence he told them the Ice Age was really just the Chilly Age, a period of a million years when everyone had to wear sweaters. And the Stone Age became the Gravel Age, named after the long driveways of the time. The Spanish Inquisition was nothing more than an outbreak of questions such as ''How far is it from here to Madrid?'' ''What do you call the matador's hat?'' The poem darkens before it ends, as many of Collins's poems do. The teacher cannot, of course, protect anyone. His kids flee the class and, like brats out of a Larkin poem, rush to the playground ''to torment the weak / and the smart, / mussing up their hair and breaking their glasses.'' These darker hints aside, however, the poem gets by on comic agility as much as anything else -- we're ushered out with a joke about the soldiers in the Boer War telling ''long, rambling stories / designed to make the enemy nod off.''"]
["books/review", "Collins's poems are clean, suburban, antiseptic -- qualities that work both for him and against him. (Along with Garrison Keillor, Collins is surely one of the whitest men alive.) He strolls through these poems like the fl\u00e2neur of Elm Street, a combination of Walter Mitty and Jerry Seinfeld, posing questions like a stand-up comic (what is it with angels and the heads of pins?) and then riding the answers out into the ozone. Of all the questions you might want to ask about angels, the only one you ever hear is how many can dance on the head of a pin. No curiosity about how they pass the eternal time besides circling the Throne chanting in Latin or delivering a crust of bread to a hermit on earth or guiding a boy and girl across a rickety wooden bridge. Do they fly through God's body and come out singing? Do they swing like children from the hinges of the spirit world saying their names backwards and forwards? Do they sit alone in little gardens changing colors? This poem, ''Questions About Angels,'' is, like much of Collins's work, not just deft and cheerful but possessing of a slyly complicated intellectual tone. Just as often, however, his poems abandon complications of any sort and settle for merely being amiable -- the kind of work that puts you in mind of Richard Brautigan without the hippie mustache. Here, in its entirety, is ''Walking Across the Atlantic'': I wait for the holiday crowd to clear the beach"]
["books/review", "before stepping onto the first wave. Soon I am walking across the Atlantic thinking about Spain, checking for whales, waterspouts. I feel the water holding up my shifting weight. Tonight I will sleep on its rocking surface. But for now I try to imagine what this must look like to the fish below, the bottoms of my feet appearing, disappearing. Partly, the sense of weightlessness one often senses while reading ''Sailing Alone Around the Room'' derives from the fact that Collins shies away from writing about sex and messy romantic entanglements and heavy emotional responsibilities -- the stuff that makes up the DNA of many of our best poems. The speakers in Collins's poems -- or speaker, since we always seem to be hearing from Collins himself -- refer once or twice to a partner who is presumably his wife, but these are single-guy poems at heart. Death and longing and regret figure into his work, but usually only at the margins of the text. Collins is a master at getting us in the palm of his hand, but he rarely pushes us as far as we're willing to go. Collins's saving grace -- and the reason, one suspects, the poetry world's lions haven't eaten him for lunch -- is his casual self-deprecation; he's the first to blow good-natured raspberries at his own performances. In this collection's final poem, he likens his work to ''paper airplanes'' that he is sailing across the room at us, instead of piling on earnest abstractions that ''pester you / with the invisible gnats of meaning.'' He's the anti-Jorie Graham."]
["books/review", "When Collins attempts a more formal poem, he tries to pass himself off as a poet manqu\u00e9, cheering himself on from the sidelines. Here's the opening of ''Sonnet'': ''All we need is fourteen lines, well, thirteen now, / and after this one just a dozen / to launch a little ship on love's storm-tossed seas, / then only ten more left like rows of beans.'' As it happens, a surprising number of Collins's poems comment on the act of writing -- they are poems that, for the most part, work to demystify the poet's art. There are poems here about cleaning the house before writing, about making coffee and listening to jazz during breaks -- Collins writes about his CD collection more than some music critics do -- and about losing a poem by talking about it. The best of these metapoems read, to my mind anyway, like tart and welcome critiques of contemporary poetry. ''Consolation'' begins with the line ''How agreeable it is not'' (my italics) ''to be touring Italy this summer,'' before going on to note: ''How much better to command the simple precinct of home / than be dwarfed by pillar, arch, and basilica.'' This reads like a delicious satire of the poets who spend their summers abroad, checking accounts groaning with Guggenheim money, only to return with notebooks full of fey, obnoxious poems about frescoes. And in ''Osso Buco'' Collins overdoes it at dinner and announces that he's ''a creature with a full stomach -- / something you don't hear much about in poetry, / that sanctuary of hunger and deprivation.''"]
["books/review", "You finish ''Sailing Alone Around the Room'' feeling pleased that such a sensible and gifted man is America's poet laureate -- young writers have plenty to learn from his clarity and apparent ease -- while harboring nagging doubts about whether his work belongs on the high shelf of work by the best living American poets. Which is probably O.K. with Collins. I'd guess he wants his collections on that lower shelf, perhaps even a bedside table, anywhere that's close at hand."]
["books", "Messing With Narnia - The New York Times To the Editor; I largely agree with Judith Shulevitz in her ''Close Reader'' conclusions about C. S. Lewis and Narnia (''Don't Mess With Aslan,'' Aug. 26): that they shouldn't be bowdlerized and that they reflect the complex web of Lewis's own life and learning. But we will understand Lewis more deeply when we define some points more clearly. The Witch's claim to Edmund's blood is not an invocation of Shylock, but is much older. It plays on a very early Christian understandings of Jesus' mission, one based on Jewish traditions. In this understanding, Adam's sin enslaved him to Satan, from whom he had to be redeemed at a cost -- i.e., the life of the ''new Adam.'' In what is more a case of nuance, I think it would be better to say that it is the Ottoman Empire, not Muslims per se, that haunts Narnia. Lewis mocks the old picture of Ottoman imperialism, through which he means in part to parody contemporary totalitarian and fascist movements. And, while his view of Islam was hardly progressive, he knew it was not like the religion of Tash. That picture owes more to the Song of Roland and the medieval literary antagonism toward the Ottoman Empire. As for the ''anti-Catholicism,'' that's a thesis I do not accept, since the donkey-in-lion-skin story is, as I recall, an old fable."]
["books", "I too am an adult fan of Narnia, who sees how it draws power from the light and dark in Lewis, and from their complex, sometimes uncomfortable interplay.

The owners of last year\u2019s Derby winner, California Chrome \u2014 Perry and Denise Martin and Steve and Carolyn Coburn \u2014 were upset with Churchill Downs after their experience here in 2014, so much so that the Martins decided to skip the Preakness. Perry Martin\u2019s mother, Catherine, was in a wheelchair, and the group had trouble getting her from their suite in the clubhouse to the winner\u2019s circle after the race. (She died in September at age 84.) \u201cChurchill did not go out of their way to get her to where she needed to be and to assist us,\u201d Carolyn Coburn said last year. \u201cSteve and Perry did everything, got her in her seat, then we had to get her to the rail so she could watch the race, then get her to the winner\u2019s circle.\u201d Churchill Downs worked to correct the problems by building 20 boxes behind the winner\u2019s circle that feature a roof, couches, betting machines and other amenities. Each owner receives 18 free tickets for the suites, up from six last year. Each box is marked by a poster of the owners\u2019 silks and has a staff of waiters. (Owners of the Kentucky Oaks contenders receive the same treatment.)"]

Birsh, the owner of the 17th-place Derby finisher, Tencendur, received a phone call from the president of Churchill Downs, Kevin Flanery, who asked if Birsh was pleased with his experience so far. Birsh planned to take his parents, who are in their 80s, to the race, and he was worried about accessibility. \u201cAll the people in the horsemen\u2019s department, they\u2019ve done a wonderful job,\u201d Birsh said Saturday as he mingled in his box. \u201cWe\u2019re really overwhelmingly pleased with our experience, especially with the driver, because that\u2019s a huge help.\u201d Owners also received an information package on what to expect. There was a dinner for owners and trainers during the week and a party in the exclusive Mansion area after the draw. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that the most vocal owners are the first-timers, like California Chrome\u2019s connections, because it can be overwhelming,\u201d said John Asher, the vice president for racing communications for Churchill Downs. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to be receptive to what they have to say.

["sports/baseball", "In an Era of Squiggles, You Can\u2019t Tell the Players Without a Handwriting Analyst - The New York Times The walls of the steakhouse at Yankee Stadium are decorated with signatures of past Yankee greats. David Robertson, the team\u2019s young closer, marvels at the fact that he can read the names. \u201cAll the old-time autographs are really neat,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lost art.\u201d Robertson, 28, is the heir to the retired Mariano Rivera, who leaves behind a legacy of brilliance in the bullpen and precision with a pen. Rivera may have spent more time on his signature than any of his peers, meticulously crafting his M\u2019s and R\u2019s and all the lowercase letters that followed. Few modern players take similar care. In the last generation or so, the classic script of Babe Ruth, Harmon Killebrew and Rivera has largely deteriorated into a mess of squiggles and personal branding. It is not just baseball, of course. The legible signature, once an indelible mark of personal identity, is increasingly rare in modern life. From President Obama, who sometimes uses an autopen, to patrons at a restaurant, few take the time to carefully sign their names. Baseball fans still clamor for autographs \u2014 as keepsakes, commodities or both. But today\u2019s treasures have little of the elegance of those that came before. A recognizable signature, let alone an artful one, now seems as quaint as a Sunday doubleheader. \u201cFans say, \u2018Can you put your number on there?' \u201d said Javier Lopez, a reliever for the San Francisco Giants. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no chance they can read them.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "Curtis Granderson, a veteran Mets outfielder, said he used to write his name neatly. But as a young player, he often found himself with hundreds of items to sign at a time \u2014 for memorabilia companies, for his team, for fans. For a person with a 10-letter last name, it was overwhelming. \u201cAs you\u2019re sitting there signing, your thought process is, \u2018How do I get out of here as quick as possible?' \u201d Granderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s how things start to shorten and shorten and shorten. And that translates to, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m down by the bullpen signing, I need to get to the dugout, I\u2019ve got five minutes \u2014 how can I get through as fast as I can and still make everybody happy?\u2019 \u201d Granderson added: \u201cA lot of people just want the fact that you signed it. They really don\u2019t care how it looks.\u201d If they do care, fans of Carlos Gonzalez, Cliff Lee, Tim Lincecum and other prime offenders will be disappointed. Toronto\u2019s R. A. Dickey, a former Cy Young Award winner, said he had a neat version he might use in a private setting. But at the ballpark, he said, he makes two discernible letters and moves down the line. Washington reliever Drew Storen, 26, said he could rarely read the autographs he collected growing up. Now his signature looks more like a butterfly than a name."]
["sports/baseball", "\u201cI put my number on it, usually, but I think of it as a design,\u201d Storen said. \u201cI challenge people to try to do it, to see if they can, but it\u2019s just autopilot for me, like, \u2018Boom.\u2019 It looks cool. It\u2019s like your own little logo, because most of the time you\u2019re signing a card, so they know who it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d Some players, like Brett Gardner, Manny Machado and Mike Trout, offer little more than initials. Even Jackie Bradley Jr., a Boston prospect who usually writes out each letter, can lapse into the habit. He once signed for Scott Mortimer, a fan and avid collector from Merrimack, N.H., with a simple \u201cJBJ.\u201d Mortimer, 43, said he was not very choosy; he just enjoys the pursuit and the experience. But he also has a signature on nearly every card in the 1983 Fleer set and can say with authority that times have changed. \u201cYou can make out the names of everyone,\u201d he said, referring to the players from 1983. \u201cBob Forsch had a great signature. Even Pete Vuckovich, he\u2019s notoriously grumpy about autographs, but you can read his signature. Ozzie Smith signed nicely. Rollie Fingers\u2019s is like artwork. Don Sutton always signs big.

["sports/baseball", "Kate Gladstone, a handwriting instructor from Albany and the director of the World Handwriting Contest, said Ruth had a model signature. Ruth attended St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School for Boys, a Baltimore orphanage and boarding school where a scribbled name, Gladstone guessed, would not have been tolerated. Whatever players\u2019 upbringing, signatures mostly stayed legible for decades. Even after Depression-era budget cuts de-emphasized handwriting in schools, Gladstone said, people born in the 1940s, \u201850s and early \u201860s tended to be taught by well-trained instructors. Today\u2019s players, many born in the 1980s, were not. Children learned print and cursive then, as now, but handwriting was generally less of a priority in curriculums. \u201cIn the \u201880s, we started to have people basically say, \u2018Oh, handwriting\u2019s not important, because in five or 10 years everything in the world will be computerized,' \u201d Gladstone said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re yet at the stage of typing our names onto baseballs.\u201d Players with clean signatures often cite an instructor or relative as their inspiration. For Robertson, it was his grandmother, Martha Robertson, who implored him to sign his full name, instead of \u201cDRob,\u201d when he reached the major leagues in 2008. For Andre Dawson, a Hall of Fame outfielder who played from 1976 to 1996, it was his aunt and first-grade teacher, Alice Daniels, who kept him after school to practice on a chalkboard."]

I get compliments about my penmanship, and I never took it for granted.\u201d Killebrew, a Hall of Famer who played from 1954 to 1975, mostly for the Minnesota Twins, was considered the dean of the dignified autograph. After he died in 2011, the Twins honored him by recreating his signature across the right-field wall at Target Field. When young Twins players signed baseballs, Killebrew watched closely, said Tom Kelly, a former manager of the team. If their penmanship did not meet his standards, he corrected them until it did. \u201cI had a swerve like everybody else \u2014 a T and a line, a dot dot, an H and a line, and something like a t,\u201d said Torii Hunter, a veteran outfielder who now plays for Detroit. But, he added, Killebrew told him a story. \u201cThink about this: 150 years from now, you\u2019re dead and gone, and kids are playing in a field,\u201d Hunter recalled Killebrew saying. \u201cA kid hits a home run, hits the ball in the weeds \u2014 far. They\u2019re looking for the ball, they find it, and it says, \u2018T, line, dot dot, H.\u2019 They don\u2019t know who it is.

In a sea of puzzling loops and lines, it is no coincidence that former Twins like Hunter, Michael Cuddyer, LaTroy Hawkins and Johan Santana now have some of the smoothest signatures in baseball. Pat Neshek, a former Twin who now pitches for St. Louis, collects autographs and tries to make his special, like Tug McGraw, the former reliever who drew a smiley face next to his name. Inside the loop of his P, Neshek sketches the seams of a baseball. When he played for Oakland, Neshek said, he admonished teammates to write legibly, the way the old players did. Sometimes they even complied. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell some guys, \u2018Hey, your autograph stinks; give me your good one,' \u201d Neshek said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll have the only good one they ever did.\u201d"]

Democrats on the conference committee lost in their effort to insist that the bill include at least $920 million to help pay for additional treatment of addicts, most of whom cannot find or afford the treatment they need. The bill would authorize the federal government to provide states with grants to fund training for first responders to treat overdoses, create alternatives to incarceration and investigate ways to combat illegal opioid distribution. The Senate version of the law originally required states receiving grants to set up prescription drug monitoring programs that doctors would have to consult when prescribing the drugs. Such mandatory programs have been found to significantly reduce opioid prescribing. But after doctors and pharmacist groups complained that the programs could be burdensome, the final language of the conference report made the adoption of such programs voluntary. The law is expected to pass the House as early as Friday on a party-line vote, but Senate Democrats said they were still considering their options.

But Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who serves as chairman of the conference committee, responded that funding for additional treatment would be provided by House and Senate Appropriations Committees in separate legislation. \u201cI would note that just this morning, the House Appropriations Committee announced that they\u2019ll be providing some $581 million to address the opioid and heroin abuse,\u201d Mr. Upton said. After Mr. Upton\u2019s comments, the committee defeated a Democratic proposal to add money to the law, known as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Versions of the law passed the Senate and House in March with overwhelming bipartisan majorities \u2014 94 to 1 in the Senate, and 400 to 5 in the House. The law is considered crucial to the electoral prospects of embattled Senate Republicans such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire as they campaign for re-election in states that have been devastated by the opioid epidemic. Fatal overdoses from opioids \u2014 prescription painkillers and heroin \u2014 have continued to rise, taking more than 28,000 lives in 2014, according to the most recent federal health data. On Wednesday, Mr. Portman hailed the conference report as \u201ca significant step forward in our collective efforts to combat this heroin and prescription drug epidemic that is tearing apart families and devastating communities.\u201d"]
["us/politics", "But other members, including Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, criticized the version that emerged from the conference. \u201cOpioid addiction is ripping through many American communities like wildfire, and in my view you cannot fight an inferno with a treatment and prevention package that is no more than a thimble-full of water,\u201d he said during the committee meeting. Gary Mendell, the founder and chief executive of Shatterproof, a New York-based anti-addiction advocacy group, had been lobbying for months to make prescription drug monitoring programs mandatory. He said he was distraught that the requirement had been eliminated, and said he also was concerned by the lack of funding. He said he did not know whether he would support the final legislation. Patrick J. Kennedy, a Democrat who is a former congressman from Rhode Island and a former addict, said that even a weak bill was worth passing. \u201cHow can we just let a number of people die from overdoses just so we can make a political point that Republicans are wrong on funding?\u201d Mr. Kennedy said in an interview. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, administration officials emphasized that funding to expand addiction treatment was crucial to any effort to address the opioid epidemic, and said they supported Democratic efforts to insist on money for treatment now Michael P. Botticelli, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said that Republicans and Democrats had long recognized that \u201cwithout additional funding and without treatment funding, we\u2019re not going to make a dent in this issue.\u201d"]
["us/politics", "Mr. Botticelli said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to declare whether Mr. Obama would veto the bill if it did not include additional funding. The administration has asked for $1.1 billion to fight heroin and opioid addictions. Also on Tuesday, administration officials announced that they would increase the number of patients that qualified physicians who prescribe a specific drug for opioid abuse could treat up to 275 patients, up from 100. There are about 2.2 million opioid addicts in the United States, of whom about one million received some form of treatment in 2014. Somewhere between 600,000 and 650,000 people were given the drug buprenorphine. Administration officials estimated that the rule change could increase the number of patients getting such treatment by up to 70,000 in the first year, still leaving most untreated but expanding care nonetheless. Buprenorphine is one of the few drugs known to help addicts kick the habit, but it has its own set of problems, since it can be used as both a medication and a way to get high. Like methadone, another treatment for opioid addiction, buprenorphine is an opioid itself and can produce euphoria and cause dependency. Its effects are milder, however, and they plateau, making overdoses less likely \u2014 and less deadly. Buprenorphine is available by prescription to treat addiction only from federally authorized doctors with restricted patient loads. Partly because of these restrictions, a volatile subculture has arisen, with cash-only buprenorphine clinics feeding a thriving underground market. The administration\u2019s new rule is intended in part to resolve some of these problems. The American Medical Association applauded the new rule."]

Researchers tracked 4,310 Irish adults 60 and older, gathering information on diet and lifestyle with questionnaires. They measured bone density and joint deterioration with X-rays and M.R.I., and tested participants\u2019 physical ability. The study is in Osteoporosis International. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption and other health and behavioral characteristics, they found that compared with those who were not yogurt eaters, people who ate yogurt daily had a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in bone mineral density. Eating yogurt daily was associated with a 39 percent lower risk of osteoporosis in women and a 52 percent lower risk in men compared with those who did not eat yogurt. Yogurt eaters also performed better on tests of physical fitness. The lead author, Eamon J.

["business/energy-environment", "Appeals Court Blocks Attempt by Vermont to Close a Nuclear Plant - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014  States cannot shut down nuclear plants over safety worries, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on Wednesday, upholding a lower court\u2019s decision that allowed the Vermont Yankee plant to keep running despite a seven-year effort by the Vermont Legislature to close it. \u201cThe nuclear power industry has just been delivered a tremendous victory against the attempt by any state to shut down federally regulated nuclear power plants,\u201d said Kathleen Sullivan, a lawyer for Entergy, which owns Vermont Yankee. The court found that states are \u201cpre-empted\u201d from regulating safety by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which made safety a federal responsibility. The Legislature had sought to shut the plant by denying Entergy a \u201ccertificate of public good\u201d that is required for all power plants. But the court said Vermont was unpersuasive when it said that the reasons for the denial were that the reactor was too costly and unreliable, and that closing it would encourage the development of renewable energy from wind or wood. In hearings and floor debate, Vermont legislators referred often to the idea that they could not legislate over the safety of the plant, which is on the Connecticut River near the Massachusetts border, and would have to find other reasons to close it. \u201cVermont tried to escape the prohibition by saying, \u2018Oh, no, we were really trying to encourage energy diversity,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Sullivan said."]
["business/energy-environment", "The court also found that because the reactor operated in a competitive market for electricity, Vermont could not close it because it was too expensive. The appeals court struck down one finding by the lower court, related to the Constitution\u2019s interstate commerce clause, that would have given Entergy the ability to seek reimbursement from Vermont for its legal costs. The state has not decided whether to appeal, said Christopher Recchia, the commissioner of the Vermont Public Service Department, which represents consumers before the body that regulates electricity rates. It has also not yet issued the \u201ccertificate of public good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still moving forward, and obviously we have been focusing on the areas that the state does have jurisdiction over,\u201d he said, including environmental issues and the economic impact of employment at the plant. Sandra Levine, a senior lawyer at the Conservation Law Foundation, a nonprofit group that entered the case as an ally of the state, said the court should not have looked at what motivated the lawmakers. \u201cThe legislation speaks for itself,\u201d she said. But because the appellate judges reaffirmed the ability of courts to examine the record and divine the real reasons for state actions, it could be relevant in New York, where the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, is seeking to close the Indian Point reactors, which are also owned by Entergy, on the Hudson River in Westchester County."]
["business/energy-environment", "New York is appearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on whether the two operating reactors there should be allowed 20-year extensions to their initial 40-year operating licenses. But it is also seeking to close the plants by imposing new limits on the use of water from the Hudson. Other states have made it difficult for reactors to build additional storage for their nuclear waste; several have banned the construction of reactors until the nuclear waste problem is resolved. While the court decision on Wednesday appears to keep Vermont Yankee safe from local political pressure, financial analysts say that it and other reactors have become far less profitable because the price they get for their electricity has fallen. Entergy recently announced that it would cut 30 jobs, out of 650, at Vermont Yankee by the end of the year."]

Of all hip-hop stars he is the most tightly wound, the most controlled. He is small and sinewy, and when he smiles, it looks as if he might actually be gritting his teeth. He fares somewhat better in his raps, which are nimble and chock full of tricky internal rhymes. But still, his vocals are thick and clipped, as if an outburst is just around the corner. Many of T.I.\u2019s hits sound a little paranoid; even his liveliest songs sound tense. Maybe that\u2019s why this Atlanta rapper\u2019s thoughtful and sometimes dark  new album,  \u201cPaper Trail\u201d (Grand Hustle/Atlantic), his sixth, sounds so oddly comfortable. It\u2019s his best album since 2003\u2019s \u201cTrap Musik,\u201d largely because it\u2019s so serious. Chalk that up to the peculiar conditions under which it was recorded. Last October T.I. was arrested by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on weapons charges. In an unusual arrangement he received a deferred sentence of a year and a day in prison (due to begin next year) in addition to 1,500 hours of community service. For a time he was under house arrest \u2014 when he began work on this album  \u2014 and he will be again following his prison term. But during  this album-release concert at the Highline, T.I. bore no evident strain."]

Songs jabbed, then receded just as quickly. And he was uncommonly loose \u2014 running back and forth onstage, rapidly tilting his head from side to side, bugging his eyes out for emphasis. (Typically he plays stages far larger than this one.) He was even a little jovial. Before \u201cLet\u2019s Get Away,\u201d one of his dimmer romantic songs, he talked about the type of women he is  most interested in (\u201cIf your nails and your toes the same color, if your bra and panties match\u201d) and, later, made a plea for fans to buy his album, suggesting, in colorful language, that if you were in a car in which \u201cPaper Trail\u201d was not playing, it might be best to get out. During \u201cWhatever You Like\u201d he seemed genuinely surprised, and maybe a little spooked, when an underdressed blonde tried to get too close, forcing him to sprint across the stage to get away. But even at his most relaxed, T.I. never quite lets his guard down. Guests, when they arrived, shook the show up. First were two oversize signees to T.I.\u2019s label, Alfamega and Big Kuntry King, who at one point flanked the diminutive star like a pair of offensive linemen, one mean, the other softly stepping.

Here Swizz gamely beatboxed while T.I. rapped, and on \u201cSwing Ya Rag,\u201d he led fans in waving the kerchiefs bearing T.I.\u2019s face they\u2019d been given earlier in the night.

North champion Steelers released Harrison, a five-time Pro Bowl linebacker who was the N.F.L. defensive player of the year in 2008, on Saturday to make room for right tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was returning from a suspension for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancing substance policy. \u201cWe make the decisions we feel give us the very best chance to win,\u201d Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday when asked why the team didn\u2019t release a different player to make room for Gilbert. \u201cWe needed the people we kept. We needed to activate Marcus Gilbert. Really, it\u2019s nothing more than that.\u201d To make room for Harrison on their roster, the Patriots released linebacker Trevor Reilly. Harrison, who is the Steelers\u2019 career leader in sacks, piling up 80.5 during his 14 seasons and 82.5 during his career over all, briefly retired in September 2014 after a forgettable 2013 season with the Cincinnati Bengals.

["business/dealbook", "Toshiba Reaches Tentative Deal to Sell Microchip Unit - The New York Times TOKYO \u2014 The board of the Japanese conglomerate Toshiba has approved a plan to sell its lucrative microchip business to a group of American and Japanese buyers, bringing the company closer to a deal it may need to survive. Details of the sale must still be finalized, Toshiba said in a statement on Wednesday, leaving open the possibility of another turn in a drawn-out bidding process marked by reversals, acrimony and confusion. But a person with knowledge of the deliberations, who asked not to be identified because the talks were not public, said Toshiba was no longer negotiating with other bidders. The Japanese company said the microchip unit would be sold for 2 trillion yen, or roughly $18 billion. The structure of the deal is complicated, and Toshiba said it would retain partial control of the business. It was not clear on Wednesday how much would end up being owned by outside investors. Those investors primarily include Bain Capital, the American buyout firm, and two organizations controlled by the Japanese government, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan. While they were the only buyers identified by Toshiba on Wednesday, others, including Apple and the South Korean semiconductor company SK Hynix, are negotiating to potentially purchase smaller stakes, the person close to the deliberations said. The business, Toshiba Memory Corporation, is an important manufacturer of flash memory chips, which are used in millions of smartphones and other digital devices."]
["business/dealbook", "Toshiba needs money from the sale to repair its tattered finances. A gaping hole in its balance sheet caused by bad bets on American nuclear power projects has threatened the future of the technology company, one of Japan\u2019s biggest and most storied. The deal\u2019s more convoluted elements appeared to stem from Toshiba\u2019s desire to retain a significant degree of control over the chip business. One way that will happen is that Toshiba said it would join Bain and its partners in creating the special purpose company that will buy the unit. In effect, that means it will keep a portion of the unit for itself, though it did not say how much. Many analysts expect it to be a minority stake. The shareholding structure could give Toshiba even more control, however. Toshiba said buyers would receive a mix of regular shares, preferred shares \u2014 which normally do not carry voting rights \u2014 and bonds that could eventually be converted into shares. Depending on how the various securities are distributed, Toshiba is likely to end up with a decisive say in the way the business is run, though its partners would take a sizable share of the profits. There are obstacles to the deal. A Toshiba business partner, the American storage company Western Digital, has been pursuing legal action against the sale. Western Digital contends that Toshiba cannot sell the chip business without its approval because the companies share ownership of a flash memory production operation in Japan."]
["business/dealbook", "Western Digital was itself bidding to invest in the microchip unit, whose assets include the joint venture. The complexities of the relationship had thrown a wrench into the sale process. The American company reiterated its opposition to the sale on Wednesday. It said in a statement that it was \u201ctroubling that Toshiba would pursue this transaction\u201d and expressed confidence that the International Court of Arbitration, a tribunal for commercial disputes that is reviewing the case, would take its side. Foxconn, an Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer with extensive operations in mainland China, also sought to invest in the Toshiba chip business. Though people close to the talks have said that Foxconn was offering plenty of cash, Japanese officials worried that selling to the Taiwan group might hasten a transfer of Japanese technology to China. Toshiba pioneered NAND flash memory and remains a powerhouse in that sector, but rivals have eroded its market share. Toshiba is the second-biggest NAND producer by volume, behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea. The Japanese company makes products as diverse as rice cookers and industrial turbines, but microchips have earned the biggest profits for Toshiba in recent years. By selling off a big part of the chip unit, Toshiba is, in effect, sacrificing future earnings for a short-term cash infusion. The company, once a symbol of Japan\u2019s technology-powered economic rise, warned this year that it might go out of business because of losses from Westinghouse Electric Company, its nuclear power unit in the United States. Toshiba paid billions for Westinghouse a decade ago, but disappointing sales and huge cost overruns turned it into a financial albatross. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy protection in March."]

["fashion/mens-style", "More Than a Cult Designer: Hiroki Nakamura Goes Big - The New York Times The moment was primed for kitsch or magic; it could have gone either way. On a warm summer morning in Florence, Italy \u2014 the air narcotic with the scent of blooming camellia \u2014 guests of the men\u2019s wear trade fair Pitti Uomo made their way through tunnels of clipped greenery at the Renaissance Boboli Gardens to a fashion show mounted by the Japanese designer Hiroki Nakamura. Stopping first at a kiosk just inside the Porta Romana gate, they donned chevron-patterned kimono jackets that Mr. Nakamura, 45, had ordered from a traditional Kyoto craftsman. Thus attired, they moved as a group toward a Zanobi del Rosso 18th-century \u201cLemon House,\u201d looking like nothing so much as members of a diplomatic legation to the Medici court in a woodblock print by Hiroshige. In reality, it was just buyers and press and other personnel from the extended fashion posse. And yet, fashion without storytelling is just sewing. It is his shrewd understanding of this precept that has helped vault Mr. Nakamura\u2019s label, Visvim, from the status of Tokyo indie to a business with a reported $100 million in sales. \u201cPart of what makes Visvim so powerful is that it evokes something in you,\u201d said the musician John Mayer, who wears Mr. Nakamura\u2019s designs in his everyday life and on stage. \u201cMy whole road case is Visvim. I\u2019m taking all the checkered madras.\u201d"]
["fashion/mens-style", "The musician represents the upper tier of Mr. Nakamura\u2019s fan base, a stratum he shares with Pharrell Williams, Eric Clapton and ASAP Rocky. Though still largely unfamiliar to the average Joe, this particular insider\u2019s secret has grown in just over 15 years to include seven free-standing stores in Japan and 135 retailers internationally. \u201cWhen I started the business, I asked myself what I wanted out of this, and I realized what I wanted was to create products that made me happy,\u201d Mr. Nakamura once told this reporter. \u201cI also wanted to build a brand that was timeless and borderless.\u201d He was determined to do so in a resolutely anachronistic manner, through word of mouth. Visvim does no advertising, and Mr. Nakamura maintains only modest social media profiles. News of his label\u2019s latest products tends to travel along a kind of moccasin telegraph, with consumers notifying one another on Instagram accounts like the semisecret one Mr. Mayer devotes to his Visvim collection of stuff like the FBT \u2014 a moccasin-sneaker hybrid that sells for $750. That is, if you can get them. Even Kanye West was put on a waiting list. Mr. Nakamura had traveled to Florence with his American wife, Kelsi, from Los Angeles, where the pair spends half the year with Riko, Mr. Nakamura\u2019s 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. The other half is spent in Tokyo, in a centuries-old wooden house set in a lush walled garden."]
["fashion/mens-style", "It was there that I visited Mr. Nakamura some weeks before Pitti Uomo, the better to understand the creations of a man who is in certain ways as much curator as designer, a student of everything from tribal textiles to rockabilly haircuts to classic automobiles. \u201cI started collecting beginning when I was 14,\u201d Mr. Nakamura said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still collecting.\u201d He had driven in that morning from Narita airport in his navy blue 1964 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III, having zigzagged over the past week from Tokyo to London, and from there to Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Florence and then home. Looking no worse for the global slog, Mr. Nakamura \u2014 tall, scruffy, handsome, dressed in a lumberjack shirt, jeans and a T-shirt riddled with holes \u2014 padded barefoot around the floors of his Edo-period dwelling, choosing from a large collection of first-press vinyl James Taylor\u2019s \u201cSweet Baby James\u201d and placing it on the turntable connected to a huge, pristine 1970s JBL Paragon D44000 speaker unit. What might have seemed contrived and stagy \u2014 the hippie ballads; the vintage sound system; the harmonious, though drafty, old structure \u2014 was instead organic to Mr. Nakamura\u2019s way of seeing, and consistent with the concept of wabi-sabi, the Zen-based aesthetic philosophy that finds beauty in imperfection. Mr. Nakamura opened the door to a tansu (a storage cabinet). Stacked inside were scores of folded textiles \u2014 kantha cloth from Kolkata, India; Teec Nos Pos weavings from a Navajo reservation; silk embroidery fragments from Herat province in Afghanistan; lengths of cochineal dyed wool from Nepal \u2014 sealed inside Ziploc bags to protect them from the depredations of mold and insects."]
["fashion/mens-style", "\u201cMy inspiration mostly comes from old textiles, beautifully made stuff from the past,\u201d said Mr. Nakamura, who, beginning as a teenager, scavenged thrift shops for World War II surplus items, 1950s denim work wear and Buddhist pilgrims\u2019 coats. \u201cI always wanted to make things that, as much as the vintage stuff I am drawn to, have strong energy.\u201d Asked why certain old things possess \u201cenergy\u201d while others don\u2019t, Mr. Nakamura grinned and shrugged. The answer may rest, again, in traditional Japanese philosophy. The takumi, or \u201ccraft,\u201d masters of certain disciplines are said to have come to them as a result of skills honed over a lifetime. Perfecting those skills, or waza \u2014 much as a samurai polishes a sword \u2014 is less an end in itself than a practice informing all dimensions of a well-rounded life. Every beautiful object is thus an inducement to consider the hand behind its creation. Mr. Nakamura likes to tell a story about a robe he acquired in Nepal. The color was of the deepest carmine. \u201cIt had a lot of power, but I wasn\u2019t sure where the power was coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I was talking to my team about how to recreate that powerful rag.\u201d The \u201crag,\u201d as it happened, had been dyed with a substance extracted from the cochineal insect, a cactus parasite native to the Americas. Mr. Nakamura was far from the first to have been seduced by a colorant whose production dates to the first millennium, a substance described in ancient Aztec codices, and one that, in the centuries before chemical dyeing became commonplace, was, after silver, the largest export from colonial Mexico."]
["fashion/mens-style", "The beauty of cochineal-dyed fabrics derives from how, like stuff colored with madder or indigo or mud, they are mutable over time. \u201cMachine-made goods are perfect beyond the original goal,\u201d Mr. Nakamura said. \u201cIn the modern world, goods are flat, flat, flat. And that, to me, is boring. I\u2019m drawn to natural stuff and unevenness, and to the humanity of things made by hand.\u201d If it\u2019s not always clear how that approach jibes with the grim dystopian sprawl of modern Tokyo, it is still possible to see how a certain dichotomy between industrialized 21st-century sensibilities and a hard-wired cultural sense of aesthetics comes into play. For Gianluca Cantaro, the editor in chief of l\u2019Officiel Hommes Italia, it is precisely that dichotomy that has made Mr. Nakamura\u2019s once-obscure label a success. \u201cThey are an island, and will always be an island,\u201d Mr. Cantaro said. \u201cWhatever influences they take from outside \u2014 and they are super-inspired by the United States and California life and the imagery involved with that \u2014 their vision of the U.S. is never the U.S. exactly. It\u2019s not a quotation. It\u2019s not a translation.\u201d Mr. Nakamura may have cut his teeth designing for that most American of brands, Burton Snowboards (he picked up his skills with high-tech materials working there), in Vermont. He may drive a 1979 Jeep Wagoneer in Los Angeles and ride his 1948 Indian Chief motorbike out into the Californian deserts. He may bedeck himself in old Navajo silver and hang a tattered American flag on a wall of his Tokyo house."]
["fashion/mens-style", "Yet, like so many of his compatriots who have assimilated traditional American styles \u2014 so-called Ametora \u2014 he remains, as Mr. Cantaro said, \u201ccompletely Japanese.\u201d That, anyway, was the consensus of a somewhat flummoxed crowd in Florence. Having dressed in kimonos to enter a French-baroque-style building, they found themselves watching a performance by a group of dancers dressed as gobs in middies and American sailors\u2019 caps. Spinning their gals or twirling mops, they danced to old swing and early rock of the sort you can hear for a quarter on the jukebox in any Johnny Rockets. The runway show continued a theme of what seemed like American archetypes: ranchers and cowboys, pump jockeys in boiler suits, retro denim and blanket plaid, early Marlon Brando and James Dean. On second glance, though, the jackets had kimono closings and were adorned with images created by a traditional Kyoto artisan who makes the fish pennants flown on the Children\u2019s Day holiday. Almost none of the fabrics, crafts or techniques that went into creating a Visvim image of the United States were actually made in that country, one whose own manufacturing traditions are now largely a thing of the past. Neither pastiche nor homage nor facile sendup, the Visvim show turned out to be something more complex and haunting. It was a traveler\u2019s depiction of a place he may have seen once or never seen at all and merely imagined: America, the mirage."]
["sports/sailing", "For Experience, America\u2019s Cup Teams Turn to Newcomers - The New York Times Peter Burling spent the weekend driving a high-performance catamaran at 30 miles per hour toward a concrete wall lined with thousands of spectators. He had to take into account a three- to five-knot current that ran along the Hudson River as he picked precise trajectories past competitors and floating marks while judging distances and counting the seconds to each maneuver. Burling, 25, with Emirates Team New Zealand, had arrived in New York leading the America\u2019s Cup World Series, which ends in France in November. On Sunday, his team won. For most of his competitors, these new Cup boats present a steep learning curve. But for the calm, soft-spoken Burling, the youngest helmsman in the fleet, this is pretty normal stuff, and with professional sailing having turned nearly entirely over to catamarans since the 2013 Cup, young sailors like Burling will very likely become the norm at the top of the professional heap. In 2013, only one professional sailing series was held in catamarans: the Extreme Sailing Series, with 40-footers. This year, five pro series are being contested in catamarans, and half are using hydrofoils, almost doubling the speed of the boats, to averages of 25 to 30 m.p.h. Sailors in their 20s, and young designers focused on foil development, are beginning to dominate this new order of the sport."]
["sports/sailing", "\u201cQuite a few guys my age have spent a lot of hours sailing hydrofoil boats, like the Flying Phantom and the International Moth,\u201d Burling said last week. \u201cBefore the Cup was foiling, I was already sailing a Moth.\u201d The foiling Moth, a single-person, single-hulled dinghy, represents the proving ground for top Cup talent. In 2011, Burling was fourth at the world championship; the winner, Nathan Outteridge, now the helmsman for Artemis Racing, was 24. The next year, Burling finished second, behind Outteridge, at the London Olympics in the two-person 49er class. Since then, Burling and his crew member, Blair Tuke, have won 25 consecutive 49er events and are favorites to win the gold medal at this summer\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Burling and Tuke are set to fly to Rio this week to get back into their 49er Olympic training. Glenn Ashby keeps their Cup team advancing. At 38, Ashby, a catamaran specialist in his third multihull Cup campaign, is the team\u2019s leader and is straddling the old and new generations of Cup sailors. He said sailors like Burling were essential to a successful Cup campaign. \u201cThe best mix these days is to have some older heads who know how a large campaign works,\u201d said Ashby, an Olympic medalist for Australia and a multiple-time world champion in multihulls, \u201cbut you need the young guys who have the skill set to push the boat hard and drive the boat accurately. If you had just old guys, you\u2019d miss out on the abilities of the foiling generation.\u201d"]
["sports/sailing", "If the position professional foiling helmsman did not exist before the 2013 Cup, neither did Nat Shaver\u2019s title of appendage designer. Designing dagger boards for an AC 50, the design being used for the 2017 Cup finals in Bermuda, is as normal for Shaver, of Groupama Team France, as racing foilers is for Burling. Today, foil designers are the most important part of the design team, with the AC 50\u2019s hulls and wings virtually the same and the foil design more open. When Shaver, 30, started with Emirates Team New Zealand\u2019s design team in 2012, there were four hull designers. \u201cTraditionally the person who designs the hull shape claims the design,\u201d said Shaver, an American who studied aeronautical engineering at the University of California, Irvine, while also building a Moth in his garage. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to deal with that, so I was designing foil stuff on the side.\u201d Once the design team figured out it could design foils that would lift the boat out of the water, Shaver recalled, the project manager Grant Dalton came into a meeting, looked at the hull designers and said, \u201cNow that we\u2019re foiling, what are you guys going to do for the rest of the campaign?\u201d For some event managers, this foiling evolution to multihulls was no surprise. \u201cProfessional sailing today is less about monohull versus multihull,\u201d said Mark Turner, who created the Extreme Sailing Series in 2007. \u201cThis is a technology-assisted move. Most people want to go faster. For commercially funded events, they need to entertain the brands, the clients, the fans in the cities. In the Extreme Series, my decision to use catamarans was right. Visually it\u2019s just better.\u201d"]
["sports/sailing", "The Extreme Sailing Series shoehorns colorful, high-speed racing into far tighter venues than the Hudson River. The tight confines of St. Petersburg, Russia, will feel even more cramped this year with the presence of foiling catamarans in the series for the first time. The tactician Chris Draper of SoftBank Team Japan and other sailors from the weekend\u2019s World Series races are graduates of Turner\u2019s series. And now that foiling is part of that series and others, the single-hulled Moth will no longer be the only way for up-and-comers to display their talent. \u201cGuys like Draper took a leap early on,\u201d said Turner, now the chief executive of the Volvo Ocean Race. \u201cThose are the guys at the front of the sport now.\u201d With the Olympic Nacra 17 catamaran class now testing out hydrofoils for possible racing at the 2020 Games, Turner sees a dramatic change not only in the marketability of the sport but also the career opportunities for young sailors. \u201cThe professional sailing world is becoming way more homogeneous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dynamic is now the same between events and the sailors more polyvalent. Burling can jump from the Olympics to the Cup and even a Volvo Ocean Race. It wasn\u2019t like that in the old days.\u201d Still, Turner said, the sport is too complex at the moment to unify its fan base. \u201cIf you go to motorsport, there are 100 events going on around the world, but there\u2019s a certain order to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the media to follow.

["sports/hockey", "In N.H.L., Fighting Is Viewed as Deterrent - The New York Times Efforts to outlaw fighting in hockey go back decades. But though the number of fights in the N.H.L. has dropped significantly in recent years, fighting persists, preserved by the idea that it is a deterrent against cheap shots, a safety valve against more serious mayhem and something that fans like to watch. This core belief in the value of fighting may prevent the league\u2019s general managers, when they meet this month in Florida, from reacting decisively to the latest research findings, including the determination announced Wednesday that the longtime enforcer Bob Probert had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease of brain tissue associated with repeated concussions. Probert, who retired in 2002 after a 16-year career with the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks, died last year at 45. At least three N.H.L. players have sustained concussions this season as a result of fighting, and Commissioner Gary Bettman has acknowledged that concussions from fighting are one reason for a slight uptick in reported brain injuries this year over years past. The Calgary enforcer Raitans Ivanans sustained a concussion in an opening night fight with Edmonton\u2019s Steve McIntyre and is still recovering from postconcussion syndrome. Edmonton defenseman Ladislav Smid missed four games with a concussion after being punched by Sean Avery of the Rangers on Nov. 14. Derek Boogaard, the 6-foot-7 Rangers enforcer, recently resumed skating after sustaining a concussion in a Dec. 9 fight with Ottawa\u2019s Matt Carkner, though Coach John Tortorella said Boogaard was \u201cstill quite a ways away\u201d from playing again."]
["sports/hockey", "There is a growing body of evidence, beyond the Probert findings, that indicates a correlation between fighting and concussions. \u201cIf you want to reduce concussions in hockey, you should outlaw fighting,\u201d said Dr. Paul Echlin, a sports medicine physician in London, Ontario, and the lead researcher in a study of concussions in junior hockey released last December. Echlin\u2019s study followed two Ontario junior teams over 52 games in 2009-10, with independent clinicians conducting in-game examinations of players suspected of having concussions. They found that of 21 diagnosed concussions, 5 were the result of fights. None were self-reported. \u201cThe normal case is that the player ends up in the penalty box and doesn\u2019t self-report,\u201d Echlin said. \u201cHe suffers symptoms that indicate he is neurologically injured, and yet they think it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Dr. Michael Stuart of the Mayo Clinic, the chief medical officer for USA Hockey and an expert on head trauma, said he was not surprised that fighting carries an increased risk of concussion. \u201cYou\u2019re punching each other in the face,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cThe objective of boxing is to cause traumatic brain injury \u2014 to knock your opponent out. So when big, powerful people fight on skates, it\u2019s not unexpected that somebody may sustain a concussion.\u201d Dr. Robert Cantu of Boston University\u2019s Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, an expert on sports-related concussions, said  hockey players have sought his advice after sustaining head trauma."]

They\u2019d bring it up relative to being hit playing hockey sometimes, but never, never from a fight.\u201d Rob Ray, a former N.H.L. enforcer, knows well the signs of concussion. \u201cEven on nights you walk away from fights, you\u2019re scrambly and get headaches,\u201d said Ray, who had 288 fights in a 15-year career. \u201cI can remember the night Stu Grimson and I got in a fight in Anaheim. We both walked away from it thinking we did well, but he missed time. And the next day in warm-ups, I couldn\u2019t turn left;  I\u2019d always fall down.\u201d Ray said that enforcers did not report their concussions  because \u201cthey know they\u2019re too easy to replace.\u201d Yet Ray, who said he sustained 10 to 12 concussions and still has days when he loses track of what he\u2019s doing, said it would be \u201ca big mistake\u201d to outlaw fighting."]

Yet despite the threat of a retributive fight, taking aim at injured players persists.

That idea may sound kind of creepy, or (worse) dreary. But I assure you that the jubilant revival of \u201cOn the Town,\u201d which opened Thursday night at the Lyric Theater, is anything but. On the contrary, this merry mating dance of a musical feels as fresh as first sunlight as it considers the urgent quest of three sailors to find girls and get, uh, lucky before their 24-hour shore leave is over. If there\u2019s a leer hovering over \u201cOn the Town,\u201d a seemingly limp 1944 artifact coaxed into pulsing new life by the director John Rando and the choreographer Joshua Bergasse, it\u2019s the leer of an angel. The best-known song from this show \u2014 which has music by Leonard Bernstein, with book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green \u2014 describes its setting as \u201ca helluva town.\u201d But the town in question \u2014 \u201cNew York, New York,\u201d if you didn\u2019t know \u2014 feels closer to heaven here. Designed in a spectrum of jelly-bean hues that makes vintage Technicolor look pallid, this is a parallel-universe New York in which hectic urban life acquires the pace and grace of a storybook ballet. It\u2019s a bustling, jostling cartoon that also floats like a swan. And it feels right that the show\u2019s central object of desire, a subway beauty queen pursued by our leading sailor (the wonderful Tony Yazbeck), is portrayed by a principal dancer from the New York City Ballet, Megan Fairchild."]

Sure, it felt irresistibly young and sassy when it opened during the entertainment-hungry World War II years, with its talented team of newcomers. In addition to Comden, Green and Bernstein, there was the rising choreographer Jerome Robbins, and they were all still in their 20s when they put the show together. Few things age faster, though, than the blatantly youthful. (Try watching a Taylor Swift video in a decade or so.) And the two Broadway revivals before now, in 1971 and 1998, had short and impoverished lives. Even the fondly remembered 1949 movie version, which starred Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, now looks winceably antiseptic. But Mr. Rando, whose Broadway career includes \u201cUrinetown\u201d (yay) and \u201cThe Wedding Singer\u201d (meh), has a loving affinity for this material that dispels the scent of mothballs. He has directed \u201cOn the Town\u201d twice before \u2014 an Encores! concert version at City Center in 2008 and, in 2013, for the Barrington Stage Company, in Pittsfield, Mass."]

Yet Mr. Rando\u2019s \u201cOn the Town\u201d has grown up quite nicely, thank you, with much of its original cast not only intact but also improved. Every element has been heightened in just the right way, a delicate achievement when you consider the heightening that\u2019s aspired to. For \u201cOn the Town\u201d traffics in two kinds of exaggerations, that of the earthy, even dirty cartoon and of the gossamer romance of poets. This reflects the bicultural nature of Robbins and Bernstein, who belonged equally to Broadway and the concert hall. Some of its numbers, in which comic archetypes cozy up or collide, could be placed directly into the cel of an animated Looney Tunes short. Others could slide seamlessly onto the stage of the Paris Opera. This \u201cOn the Town\u201d makes you forget that such contrasting sensibilities could ever be considered irreconcilable, at least in the world of musical comedy. Beowulf Boritt\u2019s simple sliding sets, Jess Goldstein\u2019s costumes and Jason Lyons\u2019s lighting evoke the city as a super candy store in which all manner of sweets are on offer.

But when he looks inward, to his lovelorn heart, he becomes a supremely eloquent dancer, a fusion of Astaire\u2019s elegance and Kelly\u2019s bounce. And he has a yearning voice to match, plied to swoony effect in ballads like the great \u201cLonely Town.\u201d The way Gabey dances is an idealized but very specific version of his character\u2019s wants and needs. And so it is for his chums, Chip (Jay Armstrong Johnson), the nerdy one, and Ozzie (Clyde Alves), the macho one. In pas de trois, they all dance the same steps, yet their approaches feel as individual as fingerprints. Throughout the show, which includes the dreamiest dream ballets I\u2019ve seen in years, Mr. Bergasse (best known for the television show \u201cSmash\u201d) maintains this rare feeling of idiosyncrasy in harmony. Similarly, he\u2019s captured the Robbins spirit, but stamped it with his own vivid signature. Women found themselves newly in charge of the home front during World War II, so it feels appropriate that the soul mates of Chip and Ozzie should be such exuberantly take-charge gals. As Hildy, the forthright taxi driver who hijacks Chip to her place, Alysha Umphress is a red-hot mama who sings double entendres with a prurience-proof, bebop gusto."]

As for Ms. Fairchild, whom Gabey falls for when he sees her picture as this month\u2019s Miss Turnstiles, she looks and talks like the sugar-sweet girl next door that all-American servicemen once dreamed of. When she dances, though, she\u2019s a goddess, that girl as she appears in their dreams. The large supporting cast embraces both virtuoso comic shtick artists \u2014 including that cutup par excellence Jackie Hoffman, along with Stephen DeRosa, Michael Rupert, Phillip Boykin and Allison Guinn \u2014 and a corps de ballet that seems to be dancing on air, even in dirty old Times Square.

It is perhaps the most significant setback yet for a booming, unregulated industry that has spent the past two weeks in the midst of allegations that have prompted federal and state investigations into whether its employees, armed with inside information, exploited paying customers. DraftKings and FanDuel, each valued at more than $1 billion, have operated under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting. Five states have prohibited them from operating, but none are as powerful and influential as Nevada, which has long been a bastion of legal gambling, operates under strict regulation, and has the nation\u2019s only active sports betting. \u201cThe Nevada Gaming Commission concluded that daily fantasy is gambling and needs to be licensed here,\u201d said David Gzesh, a Nevada lawyer specializing in gambling and sports law. \u201cIt should give other states pause because if it\u2019s perceived as sports gambling here, no other state can offer it when it violates federal law.\u201d Nevada also seemingly has the most to lose; its casinos have lacked the ability to stretch across state lines on the Internet, as daily fantasy sites have, to attract a wider, younger audience."]

In August, judges held in a 2-to-1 decision that New Jersey\u2019s efforts to allow casinos and racetracks to take bets violated the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, which was passed in 1992.

She has ridden almost every Brooklyn-bound subway line to the end just to see what was there. She loves ethnic food and cannot stay calm in a traffic jam or in the wilderness. ''Heidi was raised in Flatbush by Dodger fans,'' said Elizabeth Hollander, a friend. ''She's very fast and very bossy. She's full of life and speed and intensity and impatience.'' After graduating magna cum laude from Wellesley College, Ms. Smith followed some friends to San Francisco, where she became a founder of a revival movie theater called the Red Victorian. She stayed in San Francisco for 11 years, but never stopped missing Brooklyn. ''My true nature is to honk at the person in front of me in traffic, and I don't see the virtue of deep breathing my way out of it,'' she said. When she came back in May 1998, it was because her mother, Claire Medney Smith, who was the president of Harold Ober Associates, the literary agents in New York, had become seriously ill. Her mother died that summer. ''It was very surprising, if terminal cancer can ever surprise you,'' Ms. Smith said. For more than a year afterward, she said she often stared at the wall of her tiny downtown apartment, unemployed and unsure about what direction to take with her life. ''I would go out to the counters at the MAC make-up store and say, 'I have no foundation in my life, but I'll take some foundation on my face.' ''"]

Ms. Smith and Mr. Aronson had known each other since the 1980's, dated briefly in 1996 (no chemistry, she recalled) and went their separate ways. ''Am I allowed to say I hadn't really thought about him much over the years?'' she said. He, however, had never stopped thinking about her. Having grown up in Great Neck, N.Y., he always saw her as a kindred spirit on the West Coast. ''Heidi is eloquent and interesting and challenging,'' said Mr. Aronson, 38, an Internet engineer and entrepreneur. ''One problem about San Francisco is you don't find yourself up at 2 a.m. in a bar or coffee shop having a fascinating conversation with someone. I knew I could find that in Heidi anytime.'' He tracked her down, flew East and took her to dinner. ''He was a man with a mission, really,'' Ms. Smith said. ''He knew what he wanted, and all of a sudden it occurred to me that it was me.''

Ms. Smith came back to Brooklyn to marry on Nov. 11, in the Hall of the Americas at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

["books/review", "THE CLOSE READER; Other People's Religions - The New York Times Americans don't like religious intolerance, and who can blame them? When backed by state power, it can lead to murder and mayhem, which is why our founding fathers insisted on the separation of church and state. People who disparage other faiths no longer come off as commendably pious, as they did centuries ago; now they just seem boorish. So naturally, when Los Angeles school officials discovered anti-Semitic commentary in an edition of the Koran donated to school libraries last fall by a local Islamic foundation, they pulled the books off the shelf. Then, to emphasize that they weren't discriminating against Islam or protecting the feelings of Jews only, they announced the formation of a committee to review the commentaries accompanying all religious texts in their collection. The idea is to get rid of ''any matter reflecting adversely on persons because of their race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, sex or occupation.'' Here's the problem with the Los Angeles school district's fair-mindedness: It fails to grasp an inevitable part of religion. Most world religions originally preached intolerance of other religions. To take its mission statement at its word, the committee would have to expunge from school libraries the holy books of at least the three major creeds in this country, since their primary texts and annotations thereof are often suffused with antipathy toward unbelievers, as well as toward such nationalities as, say, the Egyptians and the Canaanites, and occupations like prostitute, moneylender and tyrant. To scrub even the footnotes to Scripture of intolerance, you have to erase religious history."]
["books/review", "Consider the Koran. The offending commentary accompanies the second chapter, in which Muhammad, speaking for Allah, reviews the history of monotheism up until his day so as to demonstrate the superiority of Islam to Judaism and Christianity. He embraces the prophets of those religions, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, but rejects their followers, who in his opinion misunderstand the prophetic messages. What's his evidence? The backsliding chronicled in biblical texts, for one, and the Jews' refusal to embrace Islam for another. This sounds self-serving, but you have to see it from the perspective of the believer committed to the truth of the new religion. He would consider deliberately obtuse a person who recognized the one God but denied his latest revelation. ''If God is one and His Message is also one and fundamentally indivisible, surely mankind should be one community,'' wrote the University of Chicago scholar Fazlur Rahman, explaining that the Koran condemned Jews and Christians -- but particularly Jews -- as sectarians who betrayed the universal nature of monotheistic truth. In the edition banned by the Los Angeles school district -- one of the most popular translations of the Koran in the English-speaking world -- the translator, writing in 1934, expounds on the troubling verses in ways that seem in no way out of keeping with their denunciatory tone. ''The Jews in their arrogance claimed that all wisdom and all knowledge of Allah were enclosed in their hearts,'' he writes. ''Their claim was not only arrogance but blasphemy. In reality they were men without Faith.''"]
["books/review", "You'd have to be pretty thick-skinned not to bristle at this, especially if you were Jewish, but Jews who don't want their own sacred writings removed from library shelves should probably remain calm. Founding religious documents almost always disparage previous or competing religions in order to prove the need for the one they are trying to establish. This holds especially true for monotheistic religions, which assert that they are in possession of unique knowledge about God. A footnote to an edition of the Torah used in most Conservative synagogues until last year, for example, explains that Canaanites had to be conquered ''because of the savage cruelty and foul licentiousness of their lives and cult.'' When it comes to speaking ill of Jews, the New Testament is at least as bad as the Koran; so is some modern-day Christian exegesis."]
["books/review", "One way to deal with unpalatable remarks in sacred books is to frame them with the kind of scholarly commentary that puts those remarks into a safely historical perspective. (This seems particularly prudent when the people attacked are still extant today, as is the case with the Jews.) Some scholars who support the Los Angeles school board's decision say that what's called for is a more responsible -- meaning historical -- edition of the Koran. Theirs is a well-intentioned but also presumptuous demand. Not all religions are willing to distance themselves through scholarship from their own literature, and it seems intolerant to insist that they must. Judaism, though it backed away from much of its xenophobia during its rabbinic period, did not welcome what 19th-century German historians of religion called Wissenschaft des Judentums -- the scientific study of Judaism -- until the 20th century, and even now many Orthodox Jews reject it. Mainstream Christian commentary on the Old and New Testaments remained openly anti-Semitic until almost as recently. In 1974, the Roman Catholic theologian Rosemary Ruether wrote that Christian seminarians were learning a religious history that ''negates ongoing Jewish existence. . . . This selective ignorance is then passed on in the teaching and preaching of Christianity in the churches in a way that continues to inculcate the myth of the carnal, legalistic and obsolete 'Jew.' ''"]
["books/review", "There aren't many editions of the Koran that could satisfy Los Angeles school officials. If we want to understand how the faithful perceive their faith, we would do better to look at how they represent it to themselves than to demand that they undergo a crash course in Enlightenment thought for our benefit. Our laws do not require that religions sanitize themselves so as to suit our modern sensibilities. John Locke, in his ''Letter Concerning Toleration'' (1689), still the best manifesto on the division of church and state, says the civil authorities should forbid only that which is ''not lawful in the ordinary course of life, nor in any private house.'' To attack someone physically because of his religion, or blow up a building in which he works, is a punishable offense. To denigrate that religion is not. And thank God for that! If we weren't allowed to disagree violently about our beliefs, what could we disagree about? Our hairstyles? Religious freedom requires as much elbowroom as intellectual freedom, notwithstanding the intensity of feeling aroused by theological debate. Maybe the Los Angeles school officials were right to think that such discussions don't belong in public schools. But I'm skeptical. Young people are at least as intelligent as the rest of us. With instruction, they ought to be able to grasp that systems of belief can be at once appealing and repugnant, and that the student's job is to discriminate between those qualities. That's what discrimination -- the good kind -- is for."]

["movies", "The real test for Warner and \u201cDawn of Justice\u201d may lie ahead, however. Any movie with both Batman and Superman in its title had better turn out huge opening-weekend crowds. Financial success will depend on repeat visits by fans in the weeks ahead and attendance by older moviegoers, who tend to skip the initial hoopla. Analysts estimate that the movie will need to take in more than $800 million worldwide to break even, after accounting for revenue splits with theaters. (Boding well for Warner: \u201cDawn of Justice\u201d faces light competition over the next two weekends.)

Neighbors and preservationists are afraid it will never come back. Before another word about the current controversy, however, let me assure a couple of astonished readers that, yes, a 19th-century watchtower still stands in Manhattan, complete with a five-ton bell, though it has not tolled a fire alarm for 136 years. \u201cThe watchtower is an organic and visible part of Harlem,\u201d Councilwoman Inez E. Dickens said last month, \u201cbut more than that, it is an irreplaceable New York City icon.\u201d In an era without alarm boxes or telephones, watchmen scanned the city from lookout towers for any sign of smoke or flame, letting fire companies know where to go by the number of bell tolls. In 1857, a 47-foot, cast-iron tower, designed by Julius B. Kroehl, was constructed atop the 70-foot Snake Hill, an otherwise unnavigable outcropping roughly where Fifth Avenue would have intersected with 122nd Street. \u201cThe entire upper end of Manhattan Island was guarded by this tower,\u201d The New York Times recalled in 1896. Three bells meant the fire was in Yorkville; four bells meant Bloomingdale, to the southwest; five bells meant Harlem; six bells meant Manhattanville; and seven bells meant Carmansville, to the northwest. The tower was decommissioned in 1878 after the advent of fire alarms. Snake Hill\u2019s steep terrain defied development. It became Mount Morris Park, which was renamed Marcus Garvey Park in 1973. The tower was designated a landmark in 1967."]

It was once used as a jungle gym by neighborhood children, including Ms. Dickens, but is now fenced off. More than 75 years have passed since it was last rehabilitated. Restoration was promised in 1986. Steel bracing was added in 1991. This fall, the parks department plans to dismantle the structure and store the components at Fort Totten in Bayside, Queens. Eventually, the pieces are to be restored and returned to the park. \u201cThe continued deterioration of its cast-iron elements and connections raises concerns that the structure is likely to be further destabilized and could collapse, especially with recent increases in major storm activities,\u201d said Phil Abramson, a spokesman for the parks department. It\u2019s the storage part that has neighbors and preservationists worried, because the agency has a $2.483 million dismantling contract but has not yet signed a restoration contract. \u201cI am afraid that once the watchtower is dismantled, there will be no urgency to restore it,\u201d Ms. Dickens said in an Aug. 19 letter to the parks commissioner. \u201cWithout the watchtower, the Acropolis will become more isolated from the rest of the park and a haven for more criminal activities.\u201d (When my colleague Ozier Muhammad and I were visiting the Acropolis on Sept. 4, a police officer shot and wounded a man during a confrontation about 100 yards from where we stood.)"]

Mr. Ay\u00f3n also recalled the brazen theft in 1974 of the panels from an 1848 building by James Bogardus, an inventor and designer who is widely credited with popularizing cast-iron architecture.

The stadium was the subject of a withering state audit last year suggesting officials inappropriately mingled private and public enterprises for a risky development. But the raid last Wednesday also set in motion a guessing game centered on which of a welter of local controversies could become part of the investigation in a town where the increase in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish population in communities like Kaser, Monsey and New Square has made it the fastest-growing area in Rockland County, and perhaps the most divided. \u201cWe started making a list of all the things they could be going in for,\u201d said Susan Shapiro, a local lawyer who is among those fighting a huge proposed housing development in what has been a largely rural section of the town. \u201cThere are so many choices.\u201d Officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation have not released details on the case, but in Ramapo it is often hard to know where one inquiry ends and another begins.

A man of cheer and Southern politeness, Colquitt had a good laugh Tuesday. But rather than a servant, he prefers to be known as a scion of the First Family of Fourth Down. On Sunday, Colquitt, 28, will punt for Denver in the Super Bowl. His brother, Dustin, 31, punts for Kansas City. Their father, Craig, 59, won two Super Bowl rings while punting for Pittsburgh in the late 1970s. And a cousin, Jimmy Colquitt, is the leading career punter at the University of Tennessee, the family alma mater, which also produced a certain quarterback named Peyton Manning. Asked whether the Colquitts were the Mannings of punting, Britton joked that first, second and third downs were of lesser relevance. \u201cFourth down, that\u2019s the important down,\u201d he said. The Broncos have needed only one punt this postseason, and the winds at MetLife Stadium can be treacherous, but Colquitt does not seem the sort to become uptight in anticipation. Two weeks ago, after Denver defeated the New England Patriots to reach the Super Bowl, he lay on the ground at Sports Authority Field and made confetti angels with his pregnant wife, Nikki."]
["sports/football", "\u201cI told Britton there will be a moment when all this sinks in,\u201d Craig Colquitt said from Nashville, where he is a sales representative for a janitorial company that cleans schools. \u201cWhen that moment comes, that this is the Super Bowl, just remember that field is the same size as a high school field.\u201d The family punting dynasty arose more by accident than by master plan. Britton (39.42 yards) and Dustin (39.27 yards) own two of the N.F.L.\u2019s top career net punting averages over the past four-plus decades, but they focused on soccer until they reached high school, their parents convinced that it was a safer sport than football. Craig thought his own playing career had ended after high school graduation in 1972 in Knoxville, Tenn. He worked several jobs over the next two years, he said, and was an undistinguished employee at Miller\u2019s department store when his manager read a newspaper article: Tennessee was holding tryouts for walk-on punters. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have no future here; you need to try that,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Colquitt said. \u201cMy parents were tremendously grateful I was headed to school.\u201d When the 1975 season opened, Craig was the Volunteers\u2019 starting punter.

Colquitt had minimized the damage, surrendering 2 points instead of 7. The Volunteers eventually won, 26-8. \u201cThat was a dramatic turn for me as far as being dedicated,\u201d Craig said. He was one of the first punters to take two steps instead of three before kicking the ball, an adjustment that reduced the chances of a block. In 1978, Colquitt became a third-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He punted in Super Bowl victories that season over Dallas, 35-31, and the next over the Los Angeles Rams, 31-19. Not that his sons were overly impressed as boys. When Dustin was 7 and Britton was 4, Craig said, he told them that they would inherit his Super Bowl rings when he died.

It was Britton, who asked, \u201cHey, Dad, when are you going to die?\u201d Britton\u2019s interest in football was sparked. In the yard, the brothers played games with their father using soccer balls and footballs, learning to pass by kicking spirals instead of throwing them. When Craig Colquitt held kicking camps, Britton went along as a teacher, while Dustin remained largely uninterested. \u201cOnce Dustin started driving and discovered girls, I never saw him at camp,\u201d Craig said. \u201cI understood.\u201d"]

He might never have taken up the sport if Bearden\u2019s kicker had not broken his ankle two weeks before football season. There was one problem. Dustin punted left-footed but did everything else right-handed, including dropping the ball to kick it, which made his technique awkward. So his father made him brush his teeth and juggle golf balls with his left hand in a crash-course effort to improve his punting style. \u201cMy gums were bleeding, I was brushing so much with my left hand,\u201d Dustin said. He said he felt uncomfortable at first in tight football pants and even inserted his pads incorrectly, leading one teammate to say, \u201cYour dad won two Super Bowls, and you can\u2019t even put your pads on right.\u201d Dustin\u2019s discomfort ended, according to Britton, who was then a freshman at Bearden, when a girl yelled from the stands, \u201cNice butt, Colquitt.\u201d \u201cHe was like, \u2018All right, I can do this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Britton said.

No N.F.L. team drafted him in 2009. Denver signed Britton as a free agent and put him on the active roster in late December 2009.

Jackson Jr. and Bruce Shapiro. 174 pp. New York: The New Press. $22.95. THE LAST FACE YOU'LL EVER SEE The Private Life of the American Death Penalty. By Ivan Solotaroff. 232 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $25. Will the death penalty survive in America? A recent series of events -- a flurry of death-row exonerations, a moratorium declared by the governor of Illinois, the execution of several mentally retarded people, the growing criticism from Europe -- has pushed public support for the death penalty to its lowest level in two decades (63 percent, according to a poll published last month). The future of capital punishment now rests with a wavering group of Americans in the middle. ''Legal Lynching'' is aimed at that group. Written by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson; his son, a United States congressman; and Bruce Shapiro, a contributing editor at The Nation, the book seeks to serve as a guide for longtime supporters of the death penalty who have developed doubts. Concise and clearly written, it marshals a host of facts and figures in an effort to change minds. How likely is it to succeed?"]
["books", "The authors attack on three fronts. The first is deterrence. It's widely believed that ''killing killers prevents crime,'' but, they argue, this is not so. Their evidence includes a poll of police chiefs in which just 1 percent said they believe that the death penalty significantly reduces the number of homicides, and a study by a sociologist at Cleveland State University who, sifting crime statistics, concluded that ''capital punishment is not more effective than imprisonment in reducing murder.'' Unfortunately, this material is presented so hurriedly that it's hard to assess its merit. We're not told, for instance, where the Cleveland State sociologist published his findings, or if he published them at all. Another strike against the death penalty, the authors argue, is that it discriminates. ''Most Americans who support capital punishment believe that the death penalty goes to those who are in some objective sense the worst offenders,'' they write. In reality, they go on, it is an ''arbitrary punishment.'' People convicted of murder in the South are far more likely to be executed for their crimes than in other regions. As for race, defendants accused of murdering a white are 4.3 times as likely to receive the death penalty than those accused of murdering a black. By themselves, however, such figures do not prove discrimination. Some researchers have found that black-on-black murders commonly occur as a result of fights or altercations, while black-on-white murders often involve armed robbery or other aggravating circumstances, for which the death penalty is more frequently applied. Regrettably, the authors do not discuss this."]
["books", "They are more convincing on the matter of legal representation. The case of George McFarland, arrested and tried in Texas for murdering a convenience-store owner, is typical. The evidence against McFarland was very flimsy, but his lawyer made few efforts to challenge it; indeed, he slept through much of the trial. An appeal based on this fact was denied. ''The Constitution says that everyone's entitled to an attorney of their choice,'' a Texas judge explained. ''But the Constitution does not say that the lawyer has to be awake.'' ''The death penalty,'' the authors declare, ''is imposed not for the worst crime, but for the worst lawyer.'' And they conclude, ''As long as we have the death penalty innocent people will die.'' In the last quarter century, nearly 100 inmates have been freed from death row, ''a staggering indicator of the unreliability of the criminal justice process,'' they write. As a remedy, ''Legal Lynching'' proposes a national moratorium on the death penalty. To build support for a permanent ban, the book urges abolitionists to take seriously Americans' concerns for a safe society and for ''the rights of victims and their families.'' Unfortunately, the book itself does not do this. Attacking ''self-described'' victim-rights groups, the authors celebrate the ''growing chorus'' of victims' families who are ''rejecting the role of executioner.'' As examples, they cite the parents of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student beaten to death in Wyoming, and Bud Welch, whose daughter died in the Oklahoma City bombing. These ''anti-execution 'survivors of homicide,' '' the authors state, ''challenge a vengeance-rights lobby that has sought a monopoly on the image of crime victims, an angry image exploited and perpetuated by politicians.''"]
["books", "No doubt politicians have exploited the anger of victims' families. But it's not clear that the handful of dissenters cited here any more reliably reflect what the authors call the ''real interests'' of survivors. Most of the families of the victims of Oklahoma City, for instance, supported the execution of Timothy McVeigh. Yet ''Legal Lynching'' cites none of them. And in contrast to the rest of the book, in which the tone is reasonable and measured, the chapter on victims' families seems angry and dismissive. This detracts from what otherwise is a strong indictment of how the death penalty is applied in this country. In ''The Last Face You'll Ever See,'' Ivan Solotaroff attempts to go beyond statistics to examine the flesh-and-blood realities of the death penalty. His focus is executioners. ''I wanted to know who carried out executions, where, when and how, and what it had been like for them to do it,'' he writes. Most states go to great lengths to conceal the identity of their executioners, but in Mississippi Solotaroff was able to contact two of them, and their experiences make up the heart of his book. Donald Hocutt, a brooding, boozing, 300-pound Delta native, seems right out of Faulkner, and Solotaroff does a good job of recreating his time at the Parchman State Penitentiary, home to Mississippi's death row. In the 1980's, Hocutt helped carry out four executions in the state's gas chamber, and through his eyes we see what actually occurs when a man is asphyxiated. Of the execution of Jimmy Lee Gray, Solotaroff writes, ''A yellow foam sizzled from his mouth, and he was bucking up against the straps with what seemed a superhuman effort, then collapsing, almost shriveling, into the chair.''"]
["books", "Press accounts of Gray's ordeal helped persuade Mississippi to phase out the gas chamber in favor of lethal injection. But Hocutt expresses no regrets. Gray was executed for having taken a 3-year-old girl into a woods, then raping her, sodomizing her and pushing her face into a bog until she choked. Walking into a local McDonald's after the execution, Hocutt found the customers happy that it had occurred. And Hocutt was, too. To the end, he remains a staunch defender of the death penalty. Far more troubled is Don Cabana, a former superintendent of Parchman. When we first meet him, Cabana is a strong supporter of capital punishment, but his firsthand exposure to it shakes him. He befriends a death-row inmate named Connie Ray Evans and, as his execution nears, engages him in long conversations about redemption and the Bible. In the 15 minutes it took Evans to die, ''something had broken'' inside Cabana, Solotaroff writes, ''and he'd never be able to put it back together.'' Not long after, Cabana left corrections work. A full-blown abolitionist, he began traveling around the country testifying against the death penalty. It was a dramatic turnaround, especially when compared with Hocutt's unflinching support. Their differences would seem to offer a rich opportunity to explore Americans' conflicted views on capital punishment. Alas, Solotaroff does not pursue this. He is after something more profound -- the ''real motive'' behind the death penalty. Quoting Yeats and Sophocles, he writes of an epiphany he had toward the end of his research: ''We execute to exert power over what horrifies us most supremely, and we execute imperfectly -- randomly, cruelly, unusually -- because murder itself seems exactly so to civilized eyes.''"]
["books", "This seems far too abstruse. The true motive of the death penalty hardly seems a mystery: it's not to deter crime or to wreak vengeance, but to exact retribution for horrific crimes. Neither of these books pays more than lip service to the families of the victims of homicide. Only by acknowledging their suffering can opponents of the death penalty hope to win over that wavering middle."]

Rafael Nadal, one of the main men on Team Europe, then became the first player in the history of the Laver Cup to try to sneak into an opponent\u2019s huddle. The history of the Laver Cup, of course, is short. The inaugural tournament, tennis\u2019s latest novelty, just took a big step Thursday in its transition from Roger Federer\u2019s brainchild to actual sporting event. Plenty remains uncertain \u2014 how much the players will truly care about the result, and how vocal the sellout crowd in Prague\u2019s O2 Arena will be \u2014 but there is no question as to which multinational squad will be the underdog in this three-day tournament. Team Europe has Nadal, the world No. 1, and Federer, the No. 2, who have 35 Grand Slam singles title between them, including two each this season. Three of their teammates are also in the top 10: Alexander Zverev at No. 4, Marin Cilic at No. 5 and Dominic Thiem at No. 7. Team World\u2019s highest-ranked player is Sam Querrey, at No. 16, while the only man on its squad with a major singles title is its captain, John McEnroe, who at age 58 is not going to be playing much tennis this weekend."]
["sports/tennis", "So this is not quite the clash of the tennis titans that Federer and his agent Tony Godsick envisaged when they created this team tournament, drawing on golf\u2019s biennial pressure cooker, the Ryder Cup. As the project took shape over the last three years, Federer and Godsick considered many ways to divvy up the talent pool. But in light of Europe\u2019s long-running domination of the men\u2019s game, they decided that, in the interest of limiting the event to just three days, it was best not to have the Europeans face squads representing the Americas or Asia or other continental constructs. They decided on a single team comprising the best from everywhere outside Europe. Enter Team World, which sounds much more imposing than it looks on paper this week. \u201cRight,\u201d Querrey conceded on Thursday as two of his young teammates, Frances Tiafoe and Denis Shapovalov, traded bon mots and forehands behind him in practice. \u201cBut the short format here kind of helps out a little bit, and our whole team is guys with big serves and big forehands, and everyone for the most part has beaten one or some of the guys on the other team, so everyone knows they can do it. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re a combined 0-200 against those guys. We have wins against them, so I think that gives us a chance, too.\u201d"]
["sports/tennis", "The top two non-European players in this week\u2019s rankings, Milos Raonic of Canada and Kei Nishikori of Japan, are injured, although Nishikori was not planning to play the Laver Cup anyway. Kevin Anderson, the South African who just lost to Nadal in the United States Open final, was unavailable on late notice after a slot opened up when the captain\u2019s pick, Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, withdrew, citing the need to recover after the U.S. Open. Querrey, the 29-year-old American, now tops the list and beat Nadal for the first time in the Acapulco final just this season. Shapovalov, the flashy 18-year-old Canadian lefthander, beat Nadal in Montreal just this summer. Nick Kyrgios, the unpredictable Australian, beat Nadal the following week in Cincinnati and is 2-2 against the Spaniard overall and 1-1 against Federer. The Laver Cup format is unusual and potentially volatile. There are three singles matches and one doubles match each day over three days of competition. But the stakes rise: victories are worth one point on Day 1; two points on Day 2 and three points on Day 3. Each match is best-of-three sets but the third set will be a super-tiebreaker, which could lead to more upsets and could help a huge server like Querrey, or his teammates John Isner and Kyrgios. The Day 1 lineup: Tiafoe vs. Cilic, Isner vs. Thiem, Shapovalov vs. Zverev; and Kyrgios and Jack Sock vs. Nadal and Tomas Berdych, in doubles \u2014 which came as quite a surprise to all those expecting Nadal to finally play alongside Federer (that should happen this weekend)."]
["sports/tennis", "Kyrgios, who can blow white-hot or stone-cold depending on his state of mind, looked and sounded particularly fired up on Thursday. Team events are clearly his thing, even if he and his Australian teammates were beaten by Belgium on Sunday in the Davis Cup semifinals (tennis\u2019s Cups runneth over). \u201cObviously I had a lot of pressure trying to get my team to the finals,\u201d Kyrgios said of Davis Cup. \u201cBut this as well has a lot of pressure in it. I think everyone is going to go 100 percent. I think everyone wants to win, and I certainly want to win.\u201d He is also the only man from his country playing in an event named for the Australian great Rod Laver, who was at the head table for the opening-night celebration on Thursday in Prague\u2019s grandiose Municipal House, where players on both teams took turns introducing each other to the audience. \u201cI don\u2019t think Rafa and Roger and those guys are just going to go out there and have fun,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if Team World ends up causing an upset and saying we\u2019ve won, that\u2019s a pretty amazing achievement.\u201d It would also be worth $250,000 to each member of the winning team. The losers get nothing, except their undisclosed but presumably generous qualification fees, which are based on ranking."]
["sports/tennis", "The longer-term challenge \u2014 and Federer and Godsick are definitely thinking long term with this project \u2014 is how to give Team World a true competitive identity. It is a similar challenge to the one faced by the International Team in another biennial team golfing event: The Presidents Cup, which will put on its 12th edition next week at Liberty National Golf Course in Jersey City, N.J. The Internationals, comprising top golfers who do not come from Europe or the United States, is so heterogeneous that creating unity, even with a common cause, has been a challenge. But for at least the inaugural Laver Cup, Team World is closer to a national team than an international team. Its captain is American, and so are four of its six players: Querrey, Isner, Sock and Tiafoe, who is 19. \u201cWe\u2019re all pretty friendly already,\u201d Querrey said. \u201cMost of us hang out at tournaments outside of this to begin with, especially the Americans. We all love football, baseball, basketball. We love team sports anyway, so everyone wishes we had more events like this.\u201d Tiafoe, ranked No. 72, was a very late addition to the team after del Potro withdrew. When Tiafoe got the call on Sunday, he was on his way to Las Vegas to prepare for a tournament next week in Chengdu, China. He did not hesitate to change his plans."]

It\u2019s being a part of this with these guys and playing against them. You\u2019re going for sure to play a top-10 or top-20 guy.\u201d Team Europe, at least this year, cannot say the same."]

["sports/basketball", "In Donning a Knicks Uniform, Joakim Noah Slips Into a Lifelong Dream - The New York Times In April, with his time with the Chicago Bulls winding down and with his future uncertain, Joakim Noah visited some old friends, coaches and teachers at Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn. Befitting his status as one of the school\u2019s more prominent alumni, Noah spoke at an assembly, addressing gun violence, which is among his more passionate causes. He was soon swarmed by students who asked about his impending free agency and whether he would sign with the Knicks. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Noah told them. \u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d Later, Bill McNally, Noah\u2019s former coach at Poly Prep, gave him a ride back to Manhattan. McNally was curious, too. It made an awful lot of sense \u2014 this idea that Noah might want to return home to join Carmelo Anthony and play for the Knicks, his favorite team growing up. McNally could sense that Noah was entertaining the possibilities. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Noah asked his old coach. As McNally\u2019s Volvo rumbled along the Gowanus Expressway, the question hinted at something with promise, something real. On Saturday night, in an otherwise nondescript preseason game against the Boston Celtics, Noah made his long-awaited debut for the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. In 19 minutes as the team\u2019s starting center, he collected 5 points, 5 rebounds and an assist in a 119-107 loss. It felt good, Noah said, to jump for rebounds, dive for loose balls and glare at the officials again."]
["sports/basketball", "\u201cI haven\u2019t played in a long time,\u201d Noah said, acknowledging that he had to work through some nerves. \u201cJust to play at the Garden, it was special.\u201d McNally, 49, scrounged up a ticket to watch from Section 113. Noah had missed the team\u2019s first three preseason games with hamstring and ankle injuries \u2014 \u201cknickknacks,\u201d Noah called them \u2014 but he looked slim, quick and bouncy to McNally, a good sign considering everything that Noah had endured in recent seasons. \u201cI think if they stay healthy, they\u2019re going to have good chemistry,\u201d McNally said of the Knicks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the two, maybe three mega-teams, and then you look at everybody else in the N.B.A. So why not the Knicks? I just don\u2019t see them folding up. Jo will never let that happen. He\u2019ll treat a mid-February game in Minnesota like it\u2019s Game 7 of the finals.\u201d That caveat \u2014 if they stay healthy \u2014 seems sure to trail the Knicks like a storm cloud for a while. Anthony has dealt with knee injuries. So, too, has Derrick Rose, who missed another game as he remained in Los Angeles to defend himself against rape allegations made by an ex-girlfriend in a civil trial. Noah, meanwhile, is still trying to summon some of his old stamina after missing much of the past two seasons with knee and shoulder injuries. His hiccups at training camp clearly frustrated him. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of been bouncing off the walls,\u201d Coach Jeff Hornacek said."]
["sports/basketball", "Everyone has championed the virtues of caution, but the Knicks are banking on Noah, who has a four-year deal worth $72 million. Even as Noah watched his teammates play without him in recent weeks, McNally saw evidence of what he described as Noah\u2019s \u201cspecial sauce\u201d \u2014 his competitive drive, his infectious personality and his consistent support of younger teammates who are not necessarily long for the locker room. \u201cThese cats aren\u2019t even going to make the team, and Jo\u2019s going up and down the bench,\u201d McNally said. \u201cEven back 100 years ago, when he played for me, he made you feel good about yourself. He made me feel good about myself.\u201d McNally added: \u201cHe just needs to get his DNA into the franchise. He\u2019s a motivator in a way that\u2019s fully acceptable for other players because he\u2019s not going to come into your timeout, like, \u2018I didn\u2019t get the ball the last three times down the court.\u2019 He\u2019ll find a rebound. He\u2019ll put his arm around your shoulders. I\u2019ve never seen a guy take such joy in setting good screens.\u201d And then there are Noah\u2019s roots. As much as Noah likes to claim that he is a citizen of the world, he identifies himself as a New Yorker. Before Saturday\u2019s game, he relayed a special request to the Garden\u2019s public-address announcer. Could he introduce Noah as hailing from Hell\u2019s Kitchen? The crowd lapped it up. \u201cThat was dope,\u201d Noah said afterward."]

According to one semi-apocryphal story relayed by McNally, Ewing presented young Joakim with his first basketball. \u201cI think he\u2019s a kid living an absolute dream,\u201d McNally said. \u201cAll these kids grow up in New York wanting to play for the Knicks.

["books/review", "Raking the Coals - The New York Times EMBERS By Sandor Marai. Translated by Carol Brown Janeway. 213 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $21. Sandor Marai's lustrous novel about an adulterous affair in turn-of-the-century Austria-Hungary could be taken for a jeweled antique, with its setting on a vast Hungarian estate and in Vienna's imperial establishment, its powerful undercurrent of suspense and its elegantly wrought armature of moral and metaphysical argument. ''Embers'' was published in 1942 in Budapest -- a poor time and place for polished considerations, let alone for getting them noticed anywhere else. The author, a leading Hungarian writer, died in obscure exile in the United States in 1989: ''Embers'' was only recently rediscovered in Europe, and now it has been translated (with stylish bite, by Carol Brown Janeway) into English. Marai shared an era and an imperial Mitteleuropa heritage with two supreme artificers of the link between individual decadence and world crackup: the Austrians Robert Musil and Joseph Roth. And there is a climactic moment in ''Embers'' that proclaims just such a connection (rougher and less nuanced, perhaps) between private fibrillation and universal infarction. The deceived husband, a former Austrian general, receives Konrad, his deceiver and onetime bosom friend and fellow officer, for a confrontation he has broodingly prepared through 40 years of separation and silence."]
["books/review", "The estate's magnificent dining room is opened (the general has long lived a hermit's life in a bare attic room), footmen in livery newly unmothballed serve up a lavish meal and the talk goes on through the night. Talk of a peculiar kind: a virtually unbroken peroration by the general, seeking to denounce and punish the injury done him by friend and wife (dead for 20 years); and, more formidably and agonizingly, to understand it. But the injury is larger than personal: like Job, the general is dealing not with boils but with God. Through Konrad, he questions his own place and fate in the cosmos. As with Camus's philosophical novels, Strindberg's one-act play ''The Stronger'' and Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor sequence, it is a shattering dialogue between speaker and silence (or here, near-silence). The general's speech is the tormented seeking of one proud and crippled soul; but at a crucial point the torment swells to take account of the breaking of nations -- it is 1939 -- for the second time in two decades. ''Perhaps this entire way of life which we have known since birth, this house, this dinner, even the words we have used this evening to discuss the questions of our lives, perhaps they all belong to the past. There's too much tension, too much animosity, too much craving for revenge in us all,'' the general, punishingly expansive, tells his punitively mute guest, not long before dawn and stiff exhaustion bring their septuagenarian duel to an end."]
["books/review", "''We look inside ourselves and what do we find? An animosity that time damped down for a while but now is bursting out again. So why should we expect anything else of our fellow men? And you and I, too, old and wise, at the end of our lives, we, too, want revenge. . . . Why should we expect better of the world, when it teems with unconscious desires and their all-too-deliberate consequences, and young men are bayoneting the hands of young men of other nations, and strangers are hacking each other's backs to ribbons, and all rules and conventions have been voided and instinct rules, and the universe is on fire?'' Thus Marai, and the link between what went on within the ruling heights of a society and what was to collapse it. But the passage, though it provides thematic edge, is only one aspect of a story that draws a vivid psychological portrait of its narrator while employing a musical command of motifs, variations, tempos and cadences. Indeed it begins with an anticipatory trumpet flourish. The general's routine -- we get the heaviness of a solitary old man administering a sunless kingdom -- is broken by the arrival of a letter. Instantly all is bustle: orders are given for the coach to be polished and the coachman arrayed to fetch the announced visitor, for the ancient dust-covers to be removed in the banquet hall, for the same candles, service, food and wine to be produced that were last brought out 40 years before."]
["books/review", "We are quickly told that it was the last meal shared by the general, his incandescent wife, Krisztina, and Konrad before the latter -- until then a thrice-weekly visitor -- decamped abroad. We are told that there was a hunting incident earlier that day. We are told little else but it's enough: the author has issued a narrative lottery ticket that keeps us breathless for the drawing that will occur in the course of the nightlong confrontation. Before Konrad's arrival we learn about the general's childhood as the frail son of an Imperial Guards captain much favored by the emperor and the artistic and musical wife he brought back from Paris to live on his wild Hungarian estate, a place of wolves and hunting. ''In our country feelings are more intense and more decisive,'' the captain cautioned his bride; the emperor warned her she'd married a bear (an honorable one). She would tame him with music, she replied; in fact they lived divided lives: she adorning the mansion with monthly wagonloads of French furniture and paintings, and holding lavish musicales; he frequenting his hunting lodge with its rustic arrangements and animal pelts. Between them the child, impossibly bridging. At 5, announcing that he will be a poet, he explains with the child's gift of getting things wrong and tragically right: ''Father is a poet too. . . . He's always thinking about something else.''"]
["books/review", "Impossible bridges must fall to one side or the other. The boy goes to the Imperial Military Academy and becomes the consummate soldier. Yet his closest friend -- he speaks of an erotic though not a sexual connection -- is Konrad, the musical, literary son of an impoverished Polish nobleman, and quite unfitted to the army. He sticks with it, though, and the bond between the two seems unbreakable; particularly after Konrad introduces Krisztina, his music-loving childhood friend. All night, with the suppressed poet gnawing within the bluff soldier, the general relates these things. He tells of his long illusion that the three made an enchanted trio; and then of the day when, hunting together, he senses Konrad aiming at him. He put it down at first to momentary breakdown or perhaps a jealous spasm. The scene is written with thrilling complexity; so is what follows. It is only the next day, after the three have dined for the last time, that bewildered shock gives way to sure horror. The general visits Konrad's lodging, finds he has vanished, notes the pitying glance of his orderly and, when Krisztina arrives moments later, is stunned by her stricken outburst: ''The coward!'' He moves across to the hunting lodge built by his father, and from that moment to her death, eight years later, they neither speak nor meet."]
["books/review", "He had thought of himself as lord of his beneficent world, assured of the devotion of the others. Lords can miss rebellion until it is too late. But the polemic torn from the general on this night 40 years later, fusing indictment and confessional, goes deeper. There is a gulf, he declares, between two human species: the active and the reflective. His father, despite a touch of insight, stood on one side of the divide; his mother, wife and friend, across it. He stood with his father yet something in him -- that yearning, failed bridge -- starved for the others. The night passes as the general excavates his own soul, brilliantly, foolishly -- it is a triumphant portrait -- while seeking Konrad's, and finding, as dawn breaks, that human love, hate and the passion for answers, all three, grow old and weary. A point that the obdurate muteness -- broken by an occasional cryptic banality -- of his friend, enemy and obsession had been proclaiming all along."]

Sanders supporters answered those calls with a hashtag that quickly started trending on Twitter: #DropOutHillary. With his victory in Indiana, Mr. Sanders seems all but certain to remain in the race for at least another month, taking his insurgent presidential campaign to the California primary on June 7. But there is one thing he will definitely leave behind if he ultimately abandons the Democratic nomination fight: an army of online foot soldiers unmatched in size, influence and capabilities, more than ready to join the next battle. The only question is whether that battle will involve Mrs. Clinton. According to Personal Democracy Media, which studies the intersection of politics and technology, roughly nine million Sanders supporters have organized through hundreds of Facebook pages, Reddit forums and Slack channels. And Mr. Sanders\u2019s digital corps is not some loose network of supporters informally sharing articles and videos. It is a driving force behind his campaign, soliciting tens of millions of dollars in donations an average of $27 at a time, routinely mobilizing volunteers to perform impressive feats of organizing, and developing cutting-edge technology to aid Mr. Sanders\u2019s run."]
["us/politics", "If Mrs. Clinton can harness even some of the power of this group, it could provide an important lift for her in a bruising general election in which social media is certain to play a prominent role. It not only would help her reach younger voters, among whom she has performed miserably in the primaries, but could also fortify her for the digital trench warfare she can expect if she faces the Twitter-adept Republican favorite, Donald J. Trump, in the fall. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s place at the forefront of her party\u2019s establishment could make her a tough sell to an online community whose members often identify themselves as revolutionaries more than as Democrats. \u201cTurning Sanders for President into a direct drive for Hillary is probably doomed,\u201d said David Fredrick, who co-founded a Reddit forum, SandersForPresident, that has more than 230,000 subscribers. \u201cIt would alienate a lot of our users and cause us to lose a lot of the momentum we\u2019ve been able to develop over the last two years.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides say they hope that at least some in Mr. Sanders\u2019s online army will ultimately get behind her \u2014 particularly now that they seem almost certain to face the stark choice between her and Mr. Trump.

A group called Coders for Sanders developed an app for canvassers, an interactive event map for Mr. Sanders\u2019s website, and the app his campaign used to track and monitor the Iowa caucuses. Volunteers also built a tool to make it easier to give money to Mr. Sanders; his campaign says 94 percent of the $200 million he has raised has come online.

For those of us who are writers, such autumnal accounting is often but another installment of a long professional self-regard, one that differs from that of haberdashers and geologists or even that of historians and literary critics. Writers, far more commonly than non writers, not only organize what happens to them into stories but throughout their writing lives seek out sometimes perilous experience that may make good ones. Like Mailer they enlist in the wartime infantry, or like Hemingway take risks in jungles or bullfight rings, not only to test themselves but to observe their feelings and reactions as they're being tested. Not a few have serial affairs or marriages. Even cautious writers like me find ourselves risking not only our own happiness but that of those we love. I will not degrade this risk taking by saying that it serves our ambitions or careers. It is, I believe, the closest thing some of us have to vocation, an almost irrational commitment to the accurate, powerful depiction of what we've felt, seen, believed, conceived and imagined. That the vocational call is almost surely a domestic rather than a long-distance one doesn't matter. Nor does it matter that the one called is also the caller."]
["arts", "Several times in my life I have found myself prolonging a painful situation because describing it became more important to me than eliminating the pain. (The original impulse to write about it was a way of controlling or defanging the pain. ''Woe weeps out her Division when she sings,'' was Ben Jonson's version of this.) Very recently, to my immense relief and happiness, a very painful separation from dear ones ended. A few hours later, along with the relief and happiness, I found myself feeling oddly hollow and anxious. What was going on? It didn't take long to realize what had happened. The hollowness and anxiety came from awareness that the novel about the separation, on which I'd been working for two years, had been deflated. I'd begun writing it in order to control or defang the pain. That worked for me as psychoanalysis or prayer, abusive fury and outrage work for others. Now the pain was gone. In the novel my protagonist, not a writer but a retired lawyer, has thought about what I'd been thinking about. He deliberates -- as I did -- about the advantages of holding on to pain. In a book of Emily Dickinson's poems, given to him -- and this is invention -- by the loved one from whom he was separated, he finds his situation expressed in these remarkable lines: Rehearsal to Ourselves Of a Withdrawn Delight -- Affords a Bliss like Murder -- Omnipotent -- Acute -- We will not drop the Dirk --"]

How many like my protagonist and myself not only adjust to the resentment or hatred of those who they think have wronged them (or whom they've wronged) but flourish in it? Yet of this many, it is only the writers whose love of and perhaps need for the wound involves a professional opportunity and makes dropping the dirk a difficult decision. I can't remember who said something like ''Happiness is white and doesn't stain the page,'' but of course almost all stories are about such forms of unhappiness as disturbance, derangement and disorder. These may be comic, may be imaginary, but they initiate storytelling. In my case, two days after happiness whitened out my subject, or, as I said, deflated it, I received a peculiar, indeed uniquely harsh letter from an old writer friend about something I'd published. Amidst the puzzlement, anger and dismay it aroused, I spotted a gleam of light: the possibility of translating this new schism into an equivalent of the one that had been whitened out. A further complication: the letter writer may well have been contemplating or even writing a work that needed to be fueled by a couple of his longtime themes, broken loyalty and estrangement from those close to him.

Late that afternoon, as my personal situation was transformed, the United States Supreme Court ordered that the recount be stopped. The political reversal -- a blow to me -- fused with the happy personal reversal. This confluence, this coincidence, was the sort of enrichment novelists not only look for but expect. Writers of my sort are so habitually alert to coincidence that the word itself seems inadequate. In novels in which the coincidences show up, they will usually be described and read not as haphazard coincidence but as devastating or farcical destiny. From the time of Hesiod and Sappho, Catullus and Li Po, lovers of literature as well as writers have known about and felt the interfusion of life and art. Some writers have been embarrassed to acknowledge it. Like Henry James they burn their papers; like T. S.

The intimately human is of more or less intimate interest to almost everyone, including those who despise the stoking of ego furnaces and like Michael Foucault dismiss the authority, if not the very idea, of authorship. The chief social role of writers may well be the extension, complication and enrichment of human intimacy. It is exercised through story, the oldest and most pleasurable way of organizing experience. The primacy of story wasn't first declared by Oscar Wilde or St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, James Joyce or Marcel Proust. It's older than Genesis. Homer's ''Odyssey'' offers one of the most remarkable versions of it. This comes near the end of Book 8, in which King Alcinous tells the disguised Odysseus to stop weeping at the song the blind bard Demodocus is singing about him and his fellow Hellenic heroes. After all, Alcinous tells him, the gods ''measured the life thread of these men so that their fate might become a poem sung for unborn generations.''

["books/review", "Save the Roach - The New York Times INSECT DREAMS The Half Life of Gregor Samsa. By Marc Estrin. 468 pp. New York: BlueHen Books/ G. P. Putnam's Sons. $26.95. EVERYONE remembers the beginning of Franz Kafka's ''Metamorphosis'' (1915), in which Gregor Samsa wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a large insect. The critic Marvin Mudrick observed that ''The Metamorphosis'' is ''an animal story which isn't a parable because the interest is in what's happening, not in why it happened or what it all means.'' In his first novel, ''Insect Dreams: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa,'' Marc Estrin plucks the bug, which was tossed into the trash at the conclusion of Kafka's tale, and lets him live on in a book that is a sort of ''Ragtime'' for roaches. Estrin propels the wriggly, six-legged Samsa through the first half of the 20th century, where he has vigorous verbal encounters with, among many others, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Robert Musil, Charles Ives and Albert Einstein. He even turns up as a surprise witness in the Scopes monkey trial. Samsa becomes a pop-culture sensation -- 1920's flappers bend their limbs to a new dance, ''the Gregor.'' He takes a job at Ives's insurance company, where he devises the theory of risk management, and eventually contributes to the World War II effort, for which he is given an appropriately small, dank office in the basement of the White House by Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Eleanor Roosevelt, presaging the concept of political correctness, refers gently to Gregor as a ''roach person.'')"]
["books/review", "This literary bugatelle could easily have become excruciatingly cute; I feared the worst early on, when Estrin has Musil -- the author of the exquisitely interminable novel ''The Man Without Qualities,'' here amusingly portrayed as a ponderous bore -- refer to Gregor as ''Herr Larva.'' But as ''Insect Dreams'' proceeds, it takes on its own logic. Having first contradicted Kafka in deciding that the charwoman employed by Gregor's parents did not dispose of their monstrous son, Estrin, like Gregor, is liberated to explore the implications of human intelligence trapped in a cracked carapace (remember the apple the appalled Papa Samsa throws so violently it permanently wounds his son?). Treated first as a freak-show novelty, then as a scuttling savant, Gregor becomes a complex figure in Estrin's imagination. He's a troubled soul, ''the sum of his confusions''; a humble bourgeois whose physical transformation also alters his inner self: he finds himself debating the morality of the atomic bomb with J. Robert Oppenheimer, as well as experiencing a longing for a woman so intense he contemplates amputating two legs to approximate more closely a human's four limbs. This is the ''half life'' of Estrin's subtitle: as a creature incapable of fully inhabiting either the insect world or humanity, he settles for working hard, as industriously as a burrowing bug, to move history in what he thinks is the proper direction."]
["books/review", "Estrin, who refers to Gregor as a ''5-foot-6-inch cockroach,'' has either opted not to read or (more likely) chosen to ignore Vladimir Nabokov's Cornell lecture on ''The Metamorphosis,'' in which the novelist-naturalist declared that, given Kafka's description, Samsa could not be a cockroach but rather was a beetle, and only three feet long at that. But Estrin's portrayal of Gregor does echo Nabokov's judgment of Kafka's writing, that ''no poetical metaphors ornament his stark black-and-white story; the limpidity of his style stresses the dark richness of his fantasy.'' Estrin, who is also a cellist, has music in his prose. After describing a Wittgenstein forced to teach grade school for money and taking his bitterness out on his students, Estrin notes of his ever-sensitive man-roach: ''If human character is infinitely plastic, he worried, what is to stop these children from being entirely formed by the resentments of their elders? He carried one such wound in his own back, unhealing, a permanent crater in his soul.'' Like his version of Kafka's creation, Estrin, with his appropriated Gregor, is busy ''building history from venomous scares,'' and furthering that history with a wit deepened by a vivid depiction of a pained creature suffused with generosity, curiosity and heroic persistence."]
["world", "MASSACRE IN BOSNIA;Srebrenica: The Days of Slaughter - The New York Times The following article is by Stephen Engelberg and Tim Weiner with further reporting from Raymond Bonner in Bosnia and Jane Perlez in Serbia. On the afternoon of July 10, soldiers of the Bosnian Serb army began storming Srebrenica, a city of refuge created by the United Nations, where more  than 40,000 people sought shelter from war. A United Nations officer in the town hunched over his computer and tapped out a desperate plea to his leaders in Geneva: Urgent urgent urgent. B.S.A. is entering the town of Srebrenica. Will someone stop this immediately and save these people. Thousands of them are gathering around the hospital. Please help.\" Nobody did. As the Western alliance stood by, the eastern Bosnian city was overrun. What followed in the towns and fields around Srebrenica is described by Western officials and human rights groups as the worst war crime in Europe since World War II: the summary killing of perhaps 6,000 people. As recounted by the few Muslims who survived, the killing was chillingly methodical, part mass slaughter, part blood sport. The Muslim men were herded by the thousands into trucks, delivered to killing sites near the Drina River, lined up four by four and shot. One survivor, 17-year-old Nezad Avdic, recalled in an interview this week that as he lay wounded among the dead Muslims, a Serbian soldier surveyed the stony, moonlit field piled with bodies and merrily declared: \"That was a good hunt. There were  a lot of rabbits here.\""]
["world", "Serbian civilians interviewed this week in the villages around Srebrenica confirmed for the first time the mass killings carried out in their midst. They pointed out the schools that were used as holding pens for the doomed Muslims -- including the schoolhouse in Karakaj where young Mr. Avdic said he was taken. They reported seeing bodies all along the roads and fields outside Srebrenica. One man said he had been stopped by soldiers who asked for help loading the bodies onto trucks for burial. A reconstruction of the fall of Srebrenica and the ensuing massacres, based on survivors' accounts, NATO and United Nations documents and interviews in Bosnia, Serbia, Washington and New York, leaves little doubt about what happened. The question of Serbian accountability promises to haunt the Bosnian peace talks that are to begin Wednesday at an Air Force base in Ohio. The role of the outsiders who were sworn to protect the town but did not -- the United Nations, NATO and the United States -- is not so stark. But the massacre of thousands of men ostensibly under international protection is regarded by many officials as the low point of Western policy in the Balkans, a  time of impotence if not acquiescence. Before the Serbian conquest of Srebrenica, some calls for help were ignored,  some rejected. Gen. Bernard Janvier, the United Nations commander for Bosnia, vetoed the air strikes that Dutch peacekeepers in Srebrenica requested to defend the town. United Nations officers said he had little enthusiasm for protecting an enclave widely viewed as an indefensible impediment to ending the war."]
["world", "After the town was overrun, the Dutch soldiers failed to relay crucial information to the United Nations, including a threat by the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, to massacre the Muslims. American officials say they had no warning the town would fall and no way to  save its people. After the Serbs swept in, the Americans did little more than urge Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, to restrain the Bosnian Serbs  and allow relief supplies to reach Srebrenica. An American reconnaissance satellite photographed hundreds of Muslim men held in fields at gunpoint on July 13 -- evidence of a crime in progress. But those riveting photos, and shots taken by a U-2 spy plane two weeks later of freshly turned earth in the same fields, were first shown to President Clinton's top advisers on Aug. 4, long after the victims were dead and buried. Those advisers said that they had no options short of sending the 82d Airborne, and that seeing the satellite photos of Muslim men in fields the day they were taken would not have changed their minds. The deaths of thousands gave life to a moribund diplomacy. The testimony of despairing refuges from the enclave caught Mr. Clinton's attention. Pushed by the United States, NATO adopted a more aggressive military stance and staged the most punishing air strikes of the war. A new American peace plan became the basis for a cease-fire and the Ohio talks."]
["world", "But the mass killings may not have ended with Srebrenica. This month thousands more men and boys captured by the Serbs in and around the town of Banja Luka have disappeared. There is no word yet on their fate. The Attack NATO's Warnings Ignored by Serbs At 3:15 A.M. on July 6, Srebrenica exploded. The Bosnian Serbs fired rockets into the United Nations compound and shelled a village to the south, sending 4,000 more people fleeing into the enclave. For weeks the Serbs had been tightening their noose on Srebrenica. They had weakened the Dutch force, allowing troops to leave on regularly scheduled rotations, but blocking their replacements, slicing the size of the battalion from 450 to 300. They confiscated spare parts for the peacekeepers' anti-tank missiles and waylaid fuel shipments. Col. Ton Karremans, the Dutch peacekeepers' commander, warned senior United Nations officers in May of signs that the Serbs were preparing to conquer the enclave, according to the Dutch Defense Ministry. Nothing was done in response to this message, United Nations officials said. \"We had indications in June that the Serbs might be concentrating on the enclave,\" an American intelligence official said. \"But it was unclear what the scope of the action was.\" As the Serbian assault continued on July 7, the Dutch peacekeepers asked their United Nations superiors to call in NATO warplanes against the attacking artillery and armor. The request was rejected by United Nations officers in Sarajevo. They saw the attack as mere \"probing.\" And they did not want to undermine the peacemaking efforts of Carl Bildt, the European negotiator, who had just arrived in the region."]
["world", "Over the next 48 hours, the attack stepped up. On July 8 the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, spoke on the Sarajevo radio, saying the people of  Srebrenica faced \"massacres and genocide\" if the town fell. He said he had delivered this warning to the United States, Germany, England, France, the United Nations and NATO. By July 9, the safe area was under attack, with shells sometimes falling every minute. The Dutch peacekeepers set up a blockade of four armored personnel carriers on the road entering Srebrenica from the south, in a desperate attempt  to stop the Serbian advance. At 10:35 P.M., Gen. Herve Gobillard, the acting United Nations commander, faxed a letter to General Mladic. \"This attack against a United Nations 'safe area' is totally unacceptable,\" it said. \"The advance must stop where it is.\" The letter explicitly said an assault on the peacekeepers' blockade would be  met by an attack with warplanes. It promised \"grave consequences\" if the Serbs ignored the warning. The Serbs ignored it. The next morning, July 10, they drove toward the center of Srebrenica. Late that afternoon, a single tank and about 100 Serbian infantrymen approached the Dutch blockade and fell back under a hail of .50-caliber machine-gun fire. In Zagreb, the Croatian capital, General Janvier, the United Nations commander for Bosnia, convened his top military advisers at 8 P.M. It was a tense meeting, repeatedly interrupted for updates from the Dutch troops. The general asked for advice. The response was nearly unanimous: air strikes. The United Nations' credibility was at stake. Srebrenica was a safe area. It had to  be defended."]
["world", "\"We need F-16's swooping down now,\" said a Dutch officer, according to a participant at the meeting. General Janvier was unpersuaded. He announced that he would sleep on it. He left his aides \"aghast,\" as a United Nations official put it. General Javier, a United Nations officer said, did not believe that the Serbs would take the town. American military and intelligence officials shared that belief. The Dutch officers in Srebrenica were even less well-informed. Lacking links  to outside intelligence, they had no way of knowing how many Serbs were attacking. Worse, they mistakenly believed that General Janvier had approved overwhelming air strikes for the next morning. At midnight, Colonel Karremans, the Dutch commander, met at the Srebrenica post office with the Mayor, the local military commander, the town's leading citizens and United Nations officers. According to a participant in this meeting, the colonel said the United Nations had delivered an ultimatum to General Mladic: Pull back by 6 A.M. or face a \"massive\" NATO air strike. And he  told Srebrenica's leaders that \"everything that moves, whether on two legs, four legs or on wheels, will be destroyed, erased from the ground,\" if the Serbs did  not withdraw, the participant said. As Colonel Karremans went to sleep, \"he expects that there will be a massive  air attack\" on 30 Serb targets in the morning, said Bert Kreemers, a spokesman for the Dutch Defense Ministry."]
["world", "At this crucial juncture -- which in hindsight, American, United Nations and  NATO officials said, was the moment of Srebrenica's downfall -- Washington was on the sidelines. Clinton Administration officials said they did not believe that the town was in imminent danger; nor did they know that General Janvier was balking at air strikes. That night in the Netherlands, the Dutch Defense Minister, Joris Voorhoeve, assured the American Ambassador that the situation was stabilizing. General Mladic, he said, had told General Janvier that the Serbs had no intention of taking Srebrenica. The Fall 'Serbs Have Won' In Srebrenica \"The situation this morning has been unusually, but creepily, calm and quiet,\" United Nations military observers in Srebrenica reported at 7:55 the next morning, July 11. \"The usual hail of shells that have been greeting our mornings is surprisingly absent today. We view this as a positive change in the  current circumstances, which undoubtedly have come from the NATO ultimatum, even though it has not been implemented yet.\" Five minutes later, the Dutch renewed their request for air attacks on the Serbs, who had not withdrawn. None came. At 11:10, the Serbs resumed their assault on Srebrenica. With that, General Janvier finally gave the go-ahead -- but limited the targets to tanks or artillery seen firing on United Nations troops. The air strikes finally began at 2:40 P.M., as tanks rolled toward the Dutch blockade. Four planes, two Dutch and two American, took aim at the tanks. They damaged one."]
["world", "It was far too little, too late. The Bosnian Serbs brushed off the largely symbolic strike. Thousands of Serbian infantrymen joined the attack, flanking the Dutch armored vehicles and streaming into the city. After the NATO warplanes bombed the tank, the Serbs threatened to kill 32 Dutch peacekeepers they had taken hostage after seizing the battalion's observations posts. They had used the tactic with brutal efficiency in May and June, when they terrorized NATO into halting air strikes by taking 400 other peacekeepers hostage. It worked again. The Dutch Defense Minister, Mr. Voorhoeve, asked for a halt  to the air strikes. The United Nations and NATO concurred. \"The Serbs have won,\" Mr. Voorhoeve announced. By 4 P.M. the Dutch were hurriedly retreating two miles north to their base camp, at a factory in a small town called Potocari. Some 20,000 terrified people joined them. The Serbs secured the town and disarmed the Dutch. They placed the Potocari camp and the refugees gathered there in the cross hairs of their tanks, artillery and rocket launchers. At 6:27 P.M., United Nations headquarters in Sarajevo faxed new orders to the beleaguered Dutch battalion. The mission had changed. The Dutch commander, Colonel Karremans, and his sector commander, Col. Charlie Brantz, read that the  battalion was ordered to \"take all reasonable measures to protect refugees and civilians in your care.\" \"Not possible,\" Colonel Brantz scribbled in the margin. They were in General  Mladic's hands now."]
["world", "At nightfall, the swaggering General Mladic -- who was about to be indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague on charges of ordering savage ethnic purges in other conquered towns -- met with Colonel Karremans. He  set his terms \"in the most threatening way,\" as the colonel later described it:  no more air strikes, or the refugees huddled at Potocari would be shelled and shot. To illustrate his plans, according to eyewitnesses, the general ordered one of his men to slit the throat of a pig and declared, \"This is what we're going to do the Muslims.\" The colonel sent a message to his superiors at the United Nations and the Dutch Defense Ministry when the meeting broke up after midnight. His official report made no mention of the Serbian general's ghoulish threat, but he wrote, \"I am not able to defend these people.\" The Refugees 'Don't Be Afraid,' Mladic Says As General Mladic made his threats, 15,000 people -- mostly the men, including the local soldiers -- gathered on the outskirts of Srebrenica, not willing to trust their lives to the United Nations or to the Serbs. Safety lay a three-day trek away, through Serb-held territory. The long march began just before midnight. The remaining refugees, as many as 25,000 jammed into the Dutch camp in Potocari, were seized with panic. Some of the women were abducted by Serbian soldiers and raped, witnesses have said. On the night of the 11th, United Nations soldiers heard screams and gunshots. Later, they found the bodies of at  least nine men, shot in the back of the head."]
["world", "General Mladic arrived at Potocari on the morning of Wednesday, July 12, with a convoy of 40 trucks and buses and a video crew. His soldiers ordered the refugees aboard, separating the men from the women. The peacekeepers stood by. \"No panic, please,\" the general said, smiling, handing a child a candy bar, in a video clip broadcast around the world. \"Don't be afraid. No one will harm you.\" Another tape made the same day but never shared with the world's networks showed a more chilling scene. In it, a Serb soldier shouts at the male refugees: \"Come on, line up, one by one! Come on! Faster, faster! Go, go, go!\" One witness who recorded the fear of the town that day was Christina Schmidt, a German-born nurse who led the Srebrenica team from the French group Doctors Without Borders. She sent her account by radio to her organization's Belgrade office, which relayed it to the world press. \"Everybody should feel the violence in the faces of the B.S.A. soldiers directing the people like animals to the buses,\" she wrote in her journal for July 12, referring to the Bosnian Serb Army. \"Everybody who could have stopped this mass exodus should be forced to feel the panic and desperation of the people.\" \"A father with his one-year-old baby is coming to me, crying, accompanied by  B.S.A.,\" she continued. \"He doesn't have anybody to take care of the baby and B.S.A. selected him for . . . ? It's a horrible scene -- I have to take the baby from his arm -- writing down his name and feeling that he will never see his child again.\""]
["world", "The Killing A Survivor, Saved by Bodies Hurem Suljic, an invalided 55-year-old carpenter with a withered right leg,  thought the Serbs would allow him on the buses taking the women, children and elderly to safety at a United Nations air base at Tuzla, 50 miles away. But when he and his wife, daughter, daughter-in-law and 7-year-old granddaughter approached the buses through a corridor of Dutch peacekeepers, he was snatched by a Serbian soldier. He was taken to a partly finished house jammed with men the Serbs had pulled out of the lines. About 7 P.M., General Mladic appeared. \"Good day, neighbors,\" he said cordially. The men demanded to know why they were being held. The general said he was going to trade them to the Bosnian Government for Serbian soldiers who had been captured. The men were taken outside, led past United Nations peacekeepers and loaded onto buses again. They went to Bratunac, on the border with Serbia. There they were put into a dilapidated warehouse, about 50 feet by 25, with a dirt floor. Several more busloads of men arrived, until about 400 men were crammed in. A Serbian soldier began shining his flashlight into their faces. \"He would shine his light around, then pick on one person,\" and order him outside, Mr. Suljic said. \"He seemed to pick the younger and stronger men.\" Screaming -- \"a specific sound, like the sound when you slaughter an animal\"  -- came from outside the warehouse, Mr. Suljic said. He said 40 men were taken out and beaten. Ten were thrown back. In the morning, five were dead."]
["world", "That morning, the 13th, the prisoners heard vehicles approach. A Serbian soldier demanded 10 volunteers from the group. No one spoke up; the men were sure that they would be forced to bury the bodies of those beaten to death, Mr.  Suljic said. The Serbs then picked 10 men for the task. They went outside. They  did not come back. Then the beatings and killings started again. Later in the day, Mr. Suljic heard more vehicles arrive. Again came a demand  for 10 volunteers. Again the vehicles left, and the 10 did not return. Early in the evening, General Mladic appeared again. \"We yelled at him, 'Why  are you holding us here, why are you killing us?' \" Mr. Suljic recalled. The Serbian military leader replied that it had taken him a while to reach an agreement on the exchange of prisoners, but that it had been arranged. The men were taken outside and loaded onto buses. Mr. Suljic saw General Mladic giving orders to the soldiers. After dark, the buses headed headed toward Zvornik, also on the border with Serbia. Just before Karakaj, the buses turned left and stopped at a school, probably near a town called Krizevici. The men were taken into the gymnasium. Soon another vehicle came and more men were shoved into the gym. They kept coming -- perhaps 2,500 in all, Mr. Suljic said."]
["world", "About noon on the 14th, General Mladic came again. He told the men that he had not been able to work out a deal with their Government to trade them for Serbian prisoners. He left, and soldiers began taking the men out of the gymnasium in groups, blindfolding them as they were led out. Mr. Suljic was taken out at nightfall. He was the last of the 25 or 30 men to board his truck. The truck moved slowly along a dirt road. Mr. Suljic said he had pushed up his blindfold and had seen a field filled with bodies. Around the bend, more bodies. Then the truck stopped. The men were ordered out. They were put in rows four abreast. From behind, the Serbian soldiers began shooting. Men fell on top of Mr. Suljic, who escaped being hit. As he lay on the grassy field under the bodies, trucks kept coming, each with 25 or 30 more men.  The men were taken out, lined up and shot. Mr. Suljic said he had seen it all clearly under the full moon. General Mladic returned, stood by while a fresh truckload of men was shot, and left, Mr. Suljic said. More groups of men were brought and killed. Finally,  Mr. Suljic said he heard some Serbs saying, \"Everything is finished; nobody is left.\" Then he saw heavy machines working. They were backhoes, digging big graves. The Hunt Refugees Killed From Ambush"]
["world", "The column of refugees that fled Potocari on foot stretched for mile after mile through Serbian-held land. They were hunted like game in the woods, ambushed, shelled and shot. They were captured, and their throats were slit. Uncounted numbers died in the woods and fields. Mr. Avdic, the 17-year-old, joined the exodus from Srebrenica on July 11. After two nights of walking, he said he had surrendered along with at least 1,000 others in his group. It was near Kravica, on the road to Konjevic Polje. The men were loaded onto trucks and taken to Bratunac. They spent the night in the truck, and the next day, the trucks went toward Zvornik, a town just across the border from Serbia. After Karakaj, the trucks stopped at a school. As the men entered the school, a Serbian soldier, holding his rifle by the barrel and swinging it like a baseball bat, hit them with the butt. Another Serbian soldier told the captives to move slowly, so the soldier with the rifle could hit everyone. Mr. Avdic was taken to the second floor and put in the last room at the end of a hallway. It was already so full that he could barely squeeze in. During the day, the Serbs took men out of the rooms, sometimes two at a time, sometimes 5 or 10. If two men were ordered out of a room, soon after there would be two shots; if five, five shots."]
["world", "\"At that moment, I knew they would probably kill us,\" Mr. Avdic said. His account of what followed has been corroborated in detail by other survivors interviewed by human rights groups. That night, the soldiers tossed him into a truck with 100 or more other men,  drove down a dirt road, and yanked them out, five at a time. Shots. Another five, and more firing. Then it was Mr. Avdic's turn. He emerged and saw, under the full moon, a field covered with dead bodies. The men were told to lie down. With his hands tied, Mr. Avdic found it difficult to do so. As he was falling the shooting started. He felt a terrible pain in his right arm and right side of his stomach. He had been shot. As he lay on the killing ground, he heard the Serbs check the bodies. \"I saw a boot near my head,\" he said. \"He stepped over me. The guy next to me was badly wounded; he was screaming. He shot him, several times. I don't know how the stones did not hit my face. I just closed my eyes. I wanted him to kill  me. I thought it would be better for me to call him. But I changed my mind.\" The Warehouse 'Everybody Is Dead In Here' Hakija Huseinovic, a 52-year-farmer and father of four -- a 14-year-old daughter was killed when Serbs shelled their village in 1992 -- also joined the  thousands of men who fled when Srebrenica fell."]
["world", "His section of the long column was ambushed the next day by the Serbs at a hill called Bulje. Scores of men were killed and wounded -- \"nobody counted,\" Mr. Huseinovic said. Then they were ambushed near Konjevic Polje, when he believes that at least 1,000 men were killed or wounded. The Serbs called for them to surrender, and about 2,000 did, Mr. Huseinovic among them. They were marched to a big valley at Lolici, where the Serbs robbed them. On the 13th, General Mladic came. \"You know it's not pleasant to make war with Serbia,\" Mr. Huseinovic quoted the general as saying. Then a Serbian commander marched the men, in a column about a third of a mile long, toward Bratunac. At Kravica, near Mr. Huseinovic's village, they were jammed into an agricultural warehouse. Then the Serbs began shooting through the windows, with automatic rifles, and firing shoulder-held grenade launchers. They were \"playing with us,\" he said. They would shoot for a while and then stop. When they would hear moaning, they would come back and shoot some more. One man, delirious, kept calling a friend's name. A Serbian soldier shouted an obscenity about the man's \"Turkish mother\" and shot him. Another man was crying  for water. A Serb shouted an obscenity about Muslims, and shot him. \"Some of us yelled, 'Why don't you just kill us all?' \" Mr. Huseinovic said.  He saw about 20 bodies in the room; he covered himself with two of them. He heard a Serbian soldier say, \"Everybody is dead in here.\""]
["world", "The next morning, the 14th, the Serbs called into the warehouse and said that anybody who was not wounded should come out and would become part of the Bosnian Serb army. Some men did go out. They were put on trucks. The Serbs then said the wounded should come out, and they would be taken to a hospital. Some men did. \"I heard shooting,\" Mr. Huseinovic said. \"I heard screaming. Then it was silent. They killed them all.\" No one is sure precisely how many people died in the fields and woods surrounding Srebrenica. American intelligence analysts estimate the number at between 5,000 and 8,000. The Reaction Serbian Villages Know of Killings The fact that thousands were killed is plain fact in the Serbian villages surrounding Srebrenica on the west bank on the Drina River. People interviewed in those villages this week said it was well known that Muslims were held captive in schools along the 13-mile stretch from Zvornik to Sepak were before they were killed. Bratislav Grubacic, editor in chief of the VIP Daily News Report in Belgrade, said he was in Bratunac and Potocari in mid-July. \"It is common knowledge in eastern Bosnia about what happened,\" he said Friday. His reporters said there were as many as 10 mass graves in the area, each containing several hundred bodies. He said the public reaction to the killings was \"shock, fear and shame.\""]
["world", "Those feelings are not universal. A priest near Sepak confirmed that the schools had been used to imprison the Muslims and that the prisoners had been shot. He expressed no remorse at the killings, but regretted the style in which  they were conducted. \"I would kill a Turk, but I wouldn't torture them,\" the priest said. The Americans Washington Slow To Understand The understanding that something unspeakable was happening dawned slowly in  Washington. Officials at the highest levels of the Clinton Administration said they had not foreseen the fall of Srebrenica. At the State Department, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency, the consensus was the Bosnian Serbs did not want to conquer the town. Nor were there signs that the Serbs would commit mass  slaughter. In hindsight, the officials say, their best information came from human rights groups, the United Nations and the press, not from spies, satellites or eavesdropping. American officials worried mainly about the Srebrenica refugees' lack of food and provisions. On July 12, the senior American diplomat in Belgrade asked President Milosevic to use his influence with the Bosnian Serbs to avert a \"humanitarian disaster.\" That day, he also pressed Mr. Milosevic to help international observers gain access to the men who had been rounded up. After the fall of Srebrenica, senior officials said they turned their attention toward creating a new policy -- using air power to protect the remaining safe havens, particularly Gorazde."]
["world", "On July 13, as the press reported refugees' accounts of mass killings, an American spy satellite passing over Bosnia recorded pictures of two fields in which hundreds of prisoners were guarded by gunmen. One of these was the stony field of the \"rabbit hunt,\" where the 17-year-old Mr. Avdic was shot. But no one saw that picture for three weeks. Techno-thriller readers think spy satellites make the C.I.A. all-seeing and all-knowing. In fact, American intelligence collects far more data than it can analyze. One former National Security Agency director said gleaning hard facts from the avalanche of information was like trying to take a drink of water from  a fire hose. An intelligence official familiar with the Bosnia photos said that \"if you saw an overhead photograph of all New York City, and there was a bank robbery going on somewhere, and nobody reported it,\" detectives would have a hard time finding the scene of the crime. Throughout July, he said, the C.I.A. lacked \"information regarding specific places and atrocities.\" The Western allies gathered in London on July 21 and adopted a much tougher stance toward the Bosnian Serbs. After balking at punishing air strikes for three years, the Europeans finally agreed: Further Serbian attacks on the safe havens would be met with exactly the sort of withering response that Colonel Karremans, the Dutch commander in Srebrenica, had asked for, but never received."]
["world", "On July 27, two weeks after the first published accounts of mass killings from survivors of the fall of Srebrenica, a U-2 spy plane passed over the sites  of the slaughter and recorded images of newly turned earth. That film was shipped to Washington on a regular military flight on July 30. That day, John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, was in Tuzla, interviewing furious and stunned refugees -- among others, Mr. Avdic, the teen-ager, and Mr. Suljic, the invalid carpenter. His reporting helped give the C.I.A. a push. By Aug. 2, \"enough information had come to us that allowed us to hone in\" on  the killing grounds, an intelligence official said. An analyst with the C.I.A.'s Balkans Task Force stayed up all night, looking through thousands of images, until he matched the men in the fields with the corresponding shot of freshly dug graves. The pictures landed at the White House on Aug. 4. They were riveting. Here was evidence, Mr. Shattuck said later, of \"direct acts of genocide.\" Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate at the United Nations, successfully argued that they be made public. That same day, Croatia's Army -- aided by the advice of retired American generals -- opened an offensive that tilted the balance of power in the Balkans. The Croats re-conquered the Krajina region of Croatian, dealing the Serbian forces their first major defeat."]
["world", "On Aug. 8, as the Serbs streamed out of Croatia, Ms. Albright stood before a  closed session of the Security Council and told the story of Srebrenica. She said the photos and the accounts by witnesses were \"compelling evidence that the Bosnian Serbs had systematically executed people who were defenseless\" -- thousands of them -- \"with the direct involvement of high-level Bosnia Serb officials.\" \"The perpetrators of these atrocities have -- literally -- not covered their  tracks,\" she said. \"The physical evidence of what they have done -- the bodies discarded in their fields -- will bear silent witness.\" In September, General Mladic confronted the West by refusing to pull his heavy weapons back from Sarajevo. This time, NATO warplanes pummeled his forces. Those attacks, and the Croatian offensive in the Krajina, persuaded the Bosnian  Serbs to agree to peace talks, which open this week in Ohio. All is calm now in Srebrenica. The grass is still green, though covered with  frost in the morning. The leaves are turning red and brown. The village is now home to thousands of Serbs driven from the Krajina."]
["world/europe", "Ukraine Town Eases Back Into Life After Deadly Week of Fighting - The New York Times"]
["sports", "Sports of The Times; Newsome Still Has All the Right Moves - The New York Times A FEW minutes before the American Football Conference championship game between Oakland and Baltimore nine days ago, Ozzie Newsome, the Ravens' vice president for pro personnel, was sitting in the press box. We exchanged pleasantries, and then I asked the inevitable question: What do you think? Without taking his eyes off the field, Newsome said, almost offhanded, that he liked the Ravens' matchup at tight end. Sure enough, midway in the second quarter, Trent Dilfer hit the tight end, Shannon Sharpe, on a quick slant and Sharpe rumbled 96 yards for a backbreaking touchdown. Newsome called it right. And Newsome has been making the right calls for the last four seasons in Baltimore. From the time he was a recruit for the University of Alabama, to a pro career with the Cleveland Browns, to the Hall of Fame, Newsome has made tons of right calls. When he arrived in Baltimore with Art Modell in 1996, the Ravens had a proficient offense. Vinny Testaverde was throwing and the offense was scoring. ''We had an offense,'' Newsome said. ''We couldn't stop anybody. So we said we've got to go out and build a defense. We tried to build a defense without killing the offense. That's tough to do in this business. We tried to balance that out, knowing that there were three key areas on both sides of the ball we had to fix.''"]
["sports", "On offense, Newsome had to get an offensive tackle to protect the quarterback from the left side. He knew he would need a quarterback soon; Testaverde was getting older. The Ravens also needed a skill person -- a receiver or a running back. On defense, the Ravens needed a pass rusher, a cornerback with tremendous coverage skills and someone who was effective against the running game. In his first draft, Newsome selected the two pillars of the franchise: tackle Jonathan Ogden on offense and middle linebacker Ray Lewis on defense. In Newsome's second draft, he chose Peter Boulware, who was converted from defensive lineman to linebacker. Newsome also selected linebacker Jamie Sharper, safety Kim Herring and center Jeff Mitchell. Each is a starter. Boulware was the defensive rookie of the year. In 1998, Newsome drafted cornerback Duane Starks, and in 1999 he chose cornerback Chris McAlister and guard Edwin Mulitalo. All three are starters. Last year he picked running back Jamal Lewis, the Tennessee all-American. Practically every choice has been a winner. Art Modell rewarded Newsome with a three-year extension and makes a point of citing him as the principal architect of the Ravens. Newsome said the key to building the Ravens was a sixth sense for talent and patience. He calls it staying solid. ''The one thing that has been most significant to me is placing a value to what you think a player's worth is to you and your organization and not chasing it,'' he said in an interview on Saturday. ''If you think the guy is a fourth-round pick, then don't take him in the first. Sometimes you might lose out on a deal, but you'll be better in the long run.''"]
["sports", "Newsome was born in Muscle Shoals, Ala., in March 1956. He said his upbringing contributed to his philosophy of looking, observing and not chasing ''Growing up in Alabama had a lot to do to shape me because it forced me not to react to every situation and circumstance,'' Newsome said. ''It taught me to stay solid. Those were some turbulent times and I was involved in some situations where, if I had reacted -- rightly or wrongly -- it could have been detrimental. You kind have to just keep yourself going forward, don't allow people to push you around.'' Newsome is old enough to remember when ''Colored Only'' signs were a real part of the environment, old enough to remember boycotts, old enough to remember when vistas for young African-Americans were severely restricted. He is young enough to have been able to explore wider paths. He was in the third class of black football players to play for Bear Bryant at Alabama. Now he is the vice president of a professional football team just a victory away from winning the Super Bowl. ''I saw the change come about,'' he said. ''I was part of the change.'' Newsome played 13 seasons in the National Football League and finished with more receptions than any other tight end in league history. For all his accomplishments, Newsome has the familiar lament of a great player who never achieved the ultimate team accomplishment. He never reached the Super Bowl."]
["sports", "''I was the Ernie Banks of the National Football League,'' Newsome said, referring to the beloved Chicago Cub first baseman who never played in a World Series. ''That's the only regret in my life; not having the opportunity of playing in the Super Bowl. Once you get in a Super Bowl, your life changes. Now you are great. You can have great statistics but up until you get that crowning glory, it's tough for people to put you in that category. ''Getting the opportunity now does ease the pain; having helped build this football team, I feel very much a part of being there. But it's not like being out there on the field and then being able to have an impact directly on the game. I'd get to catch a pass, and I could say 'Yeah, I caught five passes in the Super Bowl.'

In Friendship Heights, a neighborhood of about 5,000 residents in Chevy Chase, just outside Washington, the Council is seeking county approval for a ban on smoking in all public spaces that are maintained by the village. Under the ban, smoking on sidewalks, streets, patches of grass or any other area owned by the village would be punished with a $100 fine. Anyone discarding tobacco products in those areas would also be subject to the fine. If the regulation is approved by Montgomery County, Friendship Heights will have the most far-reaching ban on outdoor smoking in the nation, according to Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a group that works to limit the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. Some 60 jurisdictions nationwide already ban outdoor smoking in some form, but none of the bans extend beyond enclosed public spaces -- like stadiums, beaches or parks -- to the sidewalks and streets outside, the group says. The County Council is expected to vote on the measure on Dec. 12. The prime mover behind the ban, Alfred Muller, the mayor of Friendship Heights, said that the goal was not only to deter smoking, but also to protect civil rights."]
["national", "As an example, Dr. Muller, a physician, brought up the case of a resident with asthma who often had to cross the street to avoid smokers. Otherwise, Dr. Muller said, ''he would get smoke in his face. He would start coughing and it might set off an asthma attack.'' Opponents of the ban said there was no evidence that smoking outdoors endangered the health of others, and accused Dr. Muller and the Village Council of trampling on their freedom. ''A whiff of smoke in someone's face is not a crime or something we need to worry about,'' said Cleonice Tavani, the president of the Friendship Heights Village Civic Association. ''We do not need to be a police state.'' The Village Council first approved the ban over four years ago but, faced with intense opposition, pulled it from the County Council before a vote could be taken. The county must approve all laws and regulations passed by the Village Council. The neighborhood is a well-to-do mixture of high-rise apartments, shops and restaurants adjacent to a Metro stop. Last September, the measure was finally reintroduced to the County Council because of ''a friendlier environment both nationally and in the county,'' said Dr. Muller, pointing to the national tobacco settlement reached in 1998 and a ban on smoking in restaurants that the County Council approved last year."]
["national", "But it is not clear that the community is any more receptive this year. For Cynthia Pierce, a librarian who puffed on a cigarette as she prepared to go shopping, the ban would be the equivalent of outlawing smoking. If smoking outside is no longer allowed, ''they ought to just stop making cigarettes,'' said Ms. Pierce, 48, shaking her head. ''You already feel like a criminal.'' Ms. Tavani, the civic association president, said that most residents opposed the ban, and she accused Dr. Muller and the Village Council of trying to impose a regulation in defiance of the popular will. Dr. Muller waved off such accusations. ''This is not a referendum,'' he said. He was elected to do a job, he said, and if the residents are unhappy with his work, they can vote him out of office. His term expires in May. The regulation's prospects in the County Council are uncertain, officials said. But Dr. Muller said that he liked its chances and that the regulation was consistent with other county and state laws. ''You're not allowed to walk down the street with alcohol,'' he said, ''and no one makes a fuss about that.'' ''Public areas,'' he said, ''were not built for people to do whatever they want.''"]

Then Her Mike Was Cut Off. - The New York Times On the day in May that Savannah stood up to speak in front of her Mormon congregation, she did not get through everything she had wanted to say. The 12-year-old was telling other members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that she is a lesbian. \u201cNo part of me is a mistake,\u201d she said during a testimony meeting, a monthly event at her church in Eagle Mountain, Utah. \u201cI do not choose to be this way, and it is not a fad.\u201d As Savannah, now 13, was nearing the end of her comments, after she had come out to her fellow worshipers, her microphone was switched off. She tapped it and then looked to a church leader to see what had happened. He told her that she could return to her seat. \u201cI think they did that because they didn\u2019t want my message,\u201d Savannah said in a phone interview on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be mean to them if this isn\u2019t true, but I felt like they were scared of me and what I was saying.\u201d The story of Savannah\u2019s speech began to spread beyond Utah after the blog \u201cI Like to Look for Rainbows\u201d \u2014 named after the lyrics of a Mormon song, and dedicated to \u201cqueer Mormon experiences\u201d \u2014 featured an interview with Savannah on a podcast episode in May. It has highlighted an issue that gay Mormons have been struggling with for years: how to balance their sexuality with the teachings of a church that prohibits gay relationships."]
["us", "The blog\u2019s founder, Britt Jones, said he was surprised the story went on to get so much attention. \u201cThe whole reason I did this was to try to amplify the voices of queer Mormons,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if she can get her story out, I think that\u2019s pretty good. Her story is super inspirational and super necessary at this time.\u201d The bishop at Savannah\u2019s church did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. A spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had no comment. Savannah first told her parents she was gay shortly after she turned 12, said her mother, Heather Kester, who asked that Savannah\u2019s last name not be identified to protect her privacy. At testimony meetings, which are often held by Mormon churches on the first Sunday of every month, worshipers are encouraged to give \u201cverbal expression of what he or she knows to be true concerning the divinity of Jesus Christ, the restoration of the fulness of his gospel in our time, and the blessings that come from living its principles,\u201d according to the Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Ms. Kester said that her daughter had been asking for months to identify herself as a lesbian at one of these gatherings. \u201cEventually we decided to let her do it because we didn\u2019t want to keep her voice from her,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd if we taught her now that she wasn\u2019t allowed to speak, then she might keep that with her for the rest of her life.\u201d"]

But that language came less than a year after the church unveiled a policy equating gay marriage with apostasy and barring children of gay parents from joining the church until the age of 18. That policy hasn\u2019t changed, which means that Savannah\u2019s comments at the meeting last month, which included her dreams of getting married as a lesbian and raising a family, were in conflict with official Mormon doctrine. Some critics of Savannah\u2019s coming-out speech have objected to more than just its content, arguing that a testimony meeting is no place for prepared speeches, and that Savannah is too young to understand the full impact of her words, now immortalized in a video online."]

In the last part of her written speech \u2014 the part that was never delivered at the testimony meeting \u2014 Savannah, who still considers herself a member of the church, explained that she was thinking about how to find happiness. \u201cI had dreams of going to the temple and getting married, and was very sad when I found out that would never happen for me,\u201d she wrote in her prepared notes. \u201cToday I choose to find my joy outside of my old dreams from when I was little.

But it is a huge leap from the junior to senior level of women\u2019s skating, and Tennell is headed to the 2018 Winter Games next month in South Korea as a most improbable American champion. Her career advancement was interrupted by stress fractures in her lower back in the spring and summer of 2015 and 2016. For three months each time, she wore a back brace. Until Thanksgiving at Skate America, a Grand Prix event in Lake Placid, N.Y., Tennell had never participated in an international competition. Six weeks ago, few considered her a contender for the Olympic team. But she took third place at Skate America. And she followed on Friday with a composed, nearly flawless performance as Cinderella to finish first at the United States national championships. On Saturday, Tennell, of Carpentersville, Ill., was named to the Olympic team, along with Mirai Nagasu, 24, of Montebello, Calif., and Karen Chen, 18, of Fremont, Calif. \u201cComing into this year, my main goal was to stay healthy,\u201d Tennell said. \u201cI knew it was an Olympic year and somebody had to go.

She is the most mature and elegant of the American women and possesses the most difficult jump \u2014 a triple Axel, which requires a takeoff from a forward position and three and a half revolutions in the air. Nagasu has been alternately brilliant and erratic in her career, sometimes troubled by self-doubt. But she finished fourth at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. And if she can land the triple Axel in South Korea and skate consistently, she might have a chance to win a medal in a sport now dominated by Russian teenagers. No American woman has won an Olympic skating medal since Sasha Cohen took silver at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy."]

If you don\u2019t get in the first time, what are you going to do, not apply again? No, you keep applying until you make it happen.\u201d Chen, the 2017 national champion and an airy jumper, battled what she believed to be a virus during these championships.

["public-editor", "Bret Stephens Takes On Climate Change. Readers Unleash Their Fury. - The New York Times Jim Thomas is a gay man living in a red state. He has friends who voted for Donald Trump and he interacts daily with people whose political views he finds questionable. Which is fine, because he believes that hearing perspectives different from your own is essential to healthy public discourse. Only not the views of Bret Stephens, the newly hired conservative columnist on The New York Times\u2019s Op-Ed pages. Why not Stephens? Thomas sees in him a provocateur who intentionally tried to incite his audience by choosing for his first column a subject of urgent concern to the left. \u201cWhat troubles me is that he had to have known that writing about climate for his debut column was a meaningful and disturbing choice,\u201d Thomas said. The Missouri resident believes Stephens is trying to create niggling doubts about the dangers of climate change by employing a tactic similar to that of some industries that stand to lose from stiff environmental regulation. Thomas is among the thousands of readers who have written in protest since Stephens, a conservative, took a seat among the elite, and mostly liberal, ranks of Times Opinion writers. His first column last weekend \u2014 arguing that climate data creates the misleading impression that we know what global warming\u2019s impact will be \u2014 produced a fresh geyser of complaints, either to the public editor, on the letters pages or posted on the column itself. No subject since the election has come close to producing this kind of anger toward The Times. Among the scores who have taken to social media are several of Stephens\u2019s new colleagues in the newsroom, some welcoming him aboard, others not so much. I expressed my own concerns about Stephens after his hiring, but I support the general principle of busting up the mostly liberal echo chamber around here."]
["public-editor", "Since his column published last weekend, I\u2019ve been sifting through the rubble, poring over complaints and reaching some readers by phone. The goal wasn\u2019t to resolve the finer points of atmospheric physics, but to get an answer to a simple question: Do you actually want a diversity of views on the Opinion pages, and if so, what\u2019s the matter with Bret Stephens? That\u2019s an important question. The Times, both in the newsroom and on the Opinion side, has proclaimed a public commitment to reflecting a broader range of perspectives in its pages. What its mostly liberal or left-leaning base of readers thinks about that strategy obviously matters. They represent the business model, after all, and many are threatening to cancel their subscriptions (although three weeks in, relatively few have). Most of the people I spoke with said they welcome opinions they don\u2019t share and resent the suggestion that they prefer an ideological safe house. But many are incensed by what they felt was the gall of Stephens to take on climate change as his first column, and then to obliquely suggest that the data underlying climate science may be flawed, just like the data that predicted a Hillary Clinton win in November. Rich Posert of Portland, Ore., said he would be happy to see a libertarian on the Op-Ed pages, or someone like Ross Douthat, another Times conservative columnist. But Posert said he doesn\u2019t understand giving a platform to a columnist he sees as intentionally casting doubt on climate science. \u201cIt\u2019s just too important,\u201d Posert said. What made matters worse was when he saw the comments of two Times editors dismissing angry readers as people who reject free speech or alternative viewpoints. That\u2019s when he canceled his subscription."]
["public-editor", "Ella Wagner, a graduate student at Loyola University Chicago, said she too favors a mix of opinions, but given the cast of mostly older white men on the Op-Ed pages now, she doesn\u2019t see Stephens as some wild departure. \u201cInstead, they found someone whose point is to destabilize the current science on climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat really annoyed me was seeing Times ads promising to pursue the \u2018truth\u2019 and then you get this alert saying, \u2018Read this column that questions the fundamental believability of facts.\u2019\u201d Also among the readers was a climate scientist, who in an email went on for many paragraphs challenging Stephens\u2019s \u201cfallacious and misleading argument.\u201d And a priest, who told me that, unlike the others, he took it upon himself to subscribe to The Times, as a gesture of reward for letting all voices speak. The bottom line: Few readers question the notion of having a conservative on the Op-Ed pages, with some caveats. But they thought it was a pugnacious move on Stephens\u2019s part to choose climate change as his first target, a subject as flammable to many younger readers as the Middle East has long been to older ones. That\u2019s the readers\u2019 side. Up the elevator on the 13th floor was Stephens, who sat beneath empty bookshelves in his new office.

["public-editor", "\u201cIt\u2019s been an education,\u201d he said of his maiden voyage into Times territory from the more conservative compound of The Wall Street Journal. \u201cSome reader comments have been really smart and engaging,\u201d he said, while many on Twitter, he said, have been less so. One tweet in particular left him explaining to his 11-year-old boy what it meant that someone wanted his dad \u201cDanny Pearl-ed.\u201d Stephens\u2019s view of his first column \u2014 what the takeaway was meant to be, and why he chose climate change for his inaugural piece \u2014 is vastly different from how many Times readers perceived it. He says he chose climate not to intentionally incite anyone, but because he was being attacked on that subject before he even arrived. He felt he couldn\u2019t dodge it. What about the assertion that his broader purpose, like that of many industries, is to stoke doubt about global warming and thus reduce the need to act? Quite the opposite, Stephens said. That may be where conciliation ends. From Stephens\u2019s perspective, the gulf between his intentions and reader reaction is partly explained by how liberals tend to approach ideas with which they disagree. \u201cThe dominant mode of liberal disagreement in many cases is to express contempt,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real problem, really for liberals.\u201d Especially in the wake of Trump, he said, \u201cThe New York Times is a last bastion of objectivity and humane civilization to many liberals.

If that\u2019s how Stephens feels, life on The Times\u2019s Op-Ed pages should stay interesting for a while, though maybe not productive. For Stephens to win over new readers he\u2019ll need to make a strategic pivot, from preaching to a choir of Journal conservatives to winning over a Times audience of suspicious liberals. Being steadfastly anti-Trump, as Stephens is, might count for something, but whatever trust was built up among Journal readers may be back on empty here. Showing some patience and respect for the new audience could start filling the tank. Readers, on the other hand, face the serious test of whether they can show tolerance for views they don\u2019t like, even those they fear are dangerous. Stephens questioned the models of climate science, but isn\u2019t it possible to take him at face value \u2014 to accept that he thinks global warming is at least partially man-made \u2014 and see where he takes his argument over time? He may not change opinions in the end, but at the very least he might concede that his stereotype of the contemptuous liberal is overly broad. I stand among the readers who worry that Stephens is minimizing the serious risk of climate change by referring to the \u201cmodest\u201d warming of the earth and likening polling data to sophisticated climate models. But I believe steadfastly that The Times should be giving readers a range of views \u2014 not just from conservatives but also populists left and right, women, blacks, Latinos and Asians.

We may as well have been living in different states, so we took what seemed like the next logical step.\u201d That step was taken by Ms. Zuckerman in February 2015, just four months after she met Mr. Weisman, when she moved into his apartment. \u201cIt made things a lot easier,\u201d Mr. Weisman said. \u201cWe never fought or got sick of each other, and no matter what I suggested, whether it was trying a new restaurant or going to a museum or concert, or even driving cross country, Lizzie was always up for a new adventure.\u201d In the coming months, they would travel to Hawaii, Panama, Cuba, Mexico, Japan, France, Germany and Colombia, among other places. Their greatest adventure, however, began to coalesce in October 2015, when they became engaged. As it turned out, marriage was not the only thing Mr. Weisman proposed: He asked Ms. Zuckerman, who had also grown tired of the Los Angeles scene, if she would consider moving with him to Nashville, where Roc Nation was opening up an office. \u201cAt first I thought, I\u2019m definitely not moving there,\u201d Ms. Zuckerman said. \u201cBut then I thought about it, and realized that if we stayed in Los Angeles, we would have never taken the next step, because it\u2019s impossible to feel financially secure there, especially for two people who just got engaged and wanted to buy a home and start a family."]
["fashion/weddings", "\u201cBut Nashville was that kind of family-friendly place where we could put roots in the ground and have a real life together. It has seasons and real people who you can communicate with every day, which sort of snaps you back into reality.\u201d In April 2016, they put Los Angeles in the rearview mirror and drove onward to a new life in Tennessee, where Ms. Zuckerman soon opened a project management consultancy that bears her name. \u201cNashville is a cute little town pretending to be a big city,\u201d Mr. Weisman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly a big enough place for us to get a fresh start.\u201d They were married on Jan. 14 at the Riverhorse on Main, a restaurant in Park City, Utah, with a rustic-meets-elegant vibe and dark wood floors, exposed brick walls, stone and metal accents and a front-of-the-house atrium that overlooks the town\u2019s busy Main Street, where the couple went to take pre-wedding photos. Later that day they stood before a friend, Rob Heppler, who had became a minister of the American Marriage Ministries to oversee the nondenominational ceremony. Mr. Weisman began to recite his vows but could get through only a few words before tears began streaming down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous,\u201d he said, wiping his brow and his watery eyes. \u201cI just love her so much.\u201d He tried once more, and this time he managed just five words, \u201cLizzie, before I met you \u2026\u201d before bursting into tears again."]

The groom eventually pulled it together and addressed his bride directly. \u201cI used to be scared,\u201d he said. \u201cScared of failing. Scared of starting a family. Scared of not making enough money. Scared of everything. I\u2019m not scared anymore, Lizzie. The only thing I fear is not spending every day for the rest of our lives together.\u201d Then it was her turn. \u201cThe face that greeted me that night on a curb in Beverly Hills has since become my best friend, mentor, playmate, confidant and my greatest challenge,\u201d the new Mrs. Weisman said.

["us/politics", "Republican Debate Spotlight Intensifies as Iowa Caucuses Near - The New York Times Thursday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., will be the sixth of the primary campaign, but only the next to last before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. And as Newt Gingrich can attest, face-offs held in the final weeks and days before the nominating contests tend to matter more. And the attacks tend to get rougher. Here are some likely clashes to watch for in the main debate, to be shown on Fox Business Network at 9 p.m. Eastern time. Donald J. Trump, through a series of news media appearances, has slowly but ingeniously generated and encouraged questions about Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president of the United States. Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, was born in Canada to a Cuban father but to an American mother, which legal experts say clears any constitutional hurdle. But a number of new polls indicate that the attacks might be taking a toll on Mr. Cruz, who narrowly leads Mr. Trump in Iowa. But while Mr. Trump spent four minutes on the subject at an Iowa rally last week, he has shied away from delivering some of his more biting campaign-trail attack lines when face to face with his rivals in previous debates. And he told CNN that he had no plans to bring up whether Mr. Cruz is a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d on Thursday night."]
["us/politics", "Mr. Cruz, for his part, has responded by dispensing with his hard-and-fast rule against attacking Mr. Trump, whose supporters he hopes to win over, or perhaps inherit, down the road. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Cruz will forcefully assail Mr. Trump\u2019s command of foreign affairs, his \u201cNew York values\u201d or anything else about him in a nationally televised debate. But Mr. Trump may not need to mention Canada at all. The New York Times\u2019s report that Mr. Cruz, who spent years railing against bank bailouts, received up to $1 million in undisclosed loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank for his first Senate campaign, could be a brutal weapon for any rival to use against him. Will Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mr. Cruz team up against Senator Marco Rubio of Florida? And will Mr. Rubio be ready for them? For weeks, Mr. Christie seemed to be having a resurgence in New Hampshire. Then an outside group supporting Mr. Rubio aimed a blistering attack ad at him there. Mr. Christie responded viscerally, saying that Mr. Rubio was too weak and ineffective to take on Hillary Clinton and suggesting that she would \u201ccut his heart out\u201d in a general election debate. Mr. Rubio also strayed into a minefield with Mr. Cruz after trying to deflect criticism of his own record on immigration by suggesting that the two shared the same positions on it. Mr. Cruz has retaliated by pointing repeatedly to Mr. Rubio\u2019s work with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is loathed by conservatives, on a failed effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws, which conservatives loathed even more."]
["us/politics", "In both instances, Mr. Rubio appeared to wander into a fight that became more intense than he was ready for. And his allies have generally been better at complaining about the attacks against him than at answering them effectively. Mr. Rubio has had weeks to prepare for the attacks he can expect onstage Thursday, however. How well he counterpunches will be closely watched. In recent weeks, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has emerged as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief critic, portraying himself as the only contender gutsy enough to stand up to him. But Mr. Trump is not Mr. Bush\u2019s most immediate concern. The \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Bush, Right to Rise USA, has been firing away with direct mail pieces at Mr. Christie in New Hampshire. And Mr. Bush has raised questions about Mr. Christie\u2019s record as the steward of New Jersey\u2019s finances. Right to Rise has also been bludgeoning Mr. Rubio in television ads. But Mr. Bush\u2019s efforts to deliver similar attacks personally backfired months ago, fueling Mr. Rubio\u2019s rise. Like Mr. Christie, Mr. Rubio and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, Mr. Bush is vying for support from right-of-center voters who are turned off by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. He badly needs a breakthrough debate moment. Should he successfully go after someone who poses a direct threat to his strategy, he could steal attention heading into the final stretch before Iowa and New Hampshire."]

At times, he seemed content to disappear while others onstage addressed the intricacies of policy \u2014 the sort of matters that Mr. Trump has sometimes appeared to bluff his way through. But in South Carolina, just seven candidates will participate in the main event. That means more microphone time for Mr. Trump, but less opportunity to hide. And the moderators, from Fox Business, were heavily focused on policy in the last debate they oversaw, in Wisconsin in November.

["world/middleeast", "Voters in Nazareth Cheer Gains by Arab Alliance  - The New York Times NAZARETH, Israel \u2014 Choruses of beeping horns echoed through this Arab city in northern Israel as word spread that an alliance of Arab parties had received 14 seats in the next Parliament, making it the third-largest bloc. Long-divided Arab parties\u2019 forming a coalition was unprecedented; so was the size of their new bloc, offering a good reason for Nazareth and other Arab towns to rejoice. \u201cThis is a great achievement,\u201d said Ahmad Tibi, a veteran Arab politician who was elected to Parliament on Tuesday, speaking at the alliance\u2019s headquarters in Nazareth. Men and women cheered and waved flags bearing the alliance\u2019s slogan, \u201cThe Will of the People.\u201d \u201cWe will have before us great challenges. We will fight racism, we will fight fascism; we will defend our rights, regardless of the government,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we are stronger.\u201d Yet as the euphoria fades, it remains far from clear what influence the Arab cohort, which calls itself the Joint List, will actually have. Exit polls on Tuesday night showed that the race between the Likud party, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the center-left Zionist Union, led by Isaac Herzog, was very close. But as the votes were counted, Likud actually had a substantial lead. In any event, Arab parties have never joined governing coalitions, not wanting to be seen as complicit in Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Moreover, Zionist parties do not invite them, explained Jafar Farah, the director of the Mossawa Center, an Arab advocacy group."]
["world/middleeast", "Yet the head of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, sees an achievement in getting this far in Israeli politics. \u201cThere is no Arab in this country who imagined that we would be the third force,\u201d said Mr. Odeh, who only weeks ago was a little-known municipal counselor from Haifa, a mixed Arab-Jewish city in northern Israel. Some see this election as a beginning in Israeli politics, in which the Arab alliance will become an active oppostion. At the very least, the large turnout gave Arabs more weight to promote their community, said the Mossawa Center director, Mr. Farah. \u201cThe discourse of separation, the discourse of racism, the discourse of incitement, that have been promoted by Bibi Netanyahu and Lieberman is the discourse that we are challenging,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname and to Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister. Arabs in Israel number some 1.7 million, forming one-fifth of the country\u2019s population. Though most are Israeli citizens, they tend to be poorer, less educated and less likely to be employed than their Jewish counterparts. Israeli Arabs say they have felt more marginalized during the years when the government in Jerusalem has been dominated by Mr. Netanyahu and Likud. For some, it culminated on Tuesday when Mr. Netanyahu, with polls showing Likud falling behind the Zionist Union, implored his party\u2019s faithful to turn out, warning that Arab voters could influence the outcome of the elections. Later, however, he said in Hebrew on Facebook that \u201cthere is nothing wrong with citizens voting, Jewish or Arab, as they wish.\u201d"]

["t-magazine/travel", "Snowbound in Japan - The New York Times It was after a three-hour train ride north from Tokyo, heading for Tsurunoyu Onsen, that I learned Tsurunoyu isn\u2019t an onsen at all. \u201cIt\u2019s really more of a hitou,\u201d Moto, my guide, delicately pointed out. We were in Honshu Island\u2019s far-north prefecture of Akita, winding our way up the unpaved road to the 300-year-old mountain lodge, and Moto seemed especially intent on setting me straight. An onsen, he explained, is a natural hot spring. A hitou is a natural hot spring that is hidden. Ah. Hiddenness being perhaps the most prized characteristic in Japanese culture \u2014 second only to a love of drawing precise distinctions on a minute scale \u2014 I undertood this was a critical difference. Tsurunoyu finally emerged from a gulch in the hills. It seemed tiny. The original lodge is flanked by a handful of low thatch-and-wood structures added over the decades, all backed by a sheer, massive wall of coniferous green. In the middle of the compound is a stream that runs down the hillside and alongside a shallow, oblong pool of hot, ice-blue water that bubbles up from the ground, where people soak for hours at a stretch. Until World War II, Tsurunoyu was something like a sanitarium; the ill and injured came here to recoup with the help of the water\u2019s healing minerals. It\u2019s the oldest and most picturesque of seven hot-spring inns in the immediate area, known collectively as the Nyuto onsens. In a 20-mile radius, there are some dozen more \u2014 but those are not really hitous and, according to Japanese logic, draw fewer visitors."]
["t-magazine/travel", "Although Tsurunoyu is mainly a destination for the Japanese, foreign travelers are starting to make the trek here. The man who served us dinner one night said he gets as many as three international visitors a week. A few days before we arrived, he\u2019d had a German diplomat. The onsen gets plenty of Germans, he said, as well as Austrians, Canadians, Australians, Italians and Taiwanese. They come in part for the area\u2019s alpine pleasures \u2014 Nyuto is contained within the Towada-Hachimantai National Park. A mountain trail connects all seven Nyuto onsens, and you can hike the whole thing in about two hours, stopping for a dip in each bath and taking in the particular properties of the various waters. (Each pool is said to confer a unique benefit.) There are also ski slopes nearby, as well as gorgeous Lake Tazawa, the country\u2019s deepest, with clear blue water and boats for rent. A few miles away, the town of Kakunodate, known for its well-preserved samurai houses and cherry-blossom festival, is a kind of Japanese Colonial Williamsburg. We drove there one afternoon and visited a half dozen of its house museums, where seemingly every stray possession left from previous owners has been thrown behind glass: fascinating displays of 17th-century armor, a puzzling assortment of 1950s vinyl LPs. Afterward we followed a group of Japanese businessmen to an udon restaurant; the area is famous for the purity of its water and therefore also its noodles."]
["t-magazine/travel", "Most people, however, come to this part of Akita simply to soak and eat. Dinner at Tsurunoyu is an elaborate, delicious, 12-course marathon of soba, soups, pickles, mushrooms, mountain vegetables and freshwater fish fried, sashimi-ed and roasted whole. Breakfast is the same, along with an egg. (By the third meal, you\u2019d kill for a sandwich.) And bath time is the bridge between meals. Moto, who\u2019d been here before, said it\u2019s common to arrive at Tsurunoyu and not leave once in a three-day stay, especially in winter, when Akita\u2019s heavy snows turn everything into sculpture. There\u2019s something about living in a kimono, sitting in primordial waters, and eating food prepared and served according to ancient ritual that makes you feel serenely outside time. For many Japanese, Moto told me, this is a particular treat, an escape from the chaos of city life and a chance to reconnect with their collective past. One night the dining room was filled with a rowdy group of married couples in their 50s having a lavish meal with many bottles of beer and sake. High, whiny violin music played on a stereo while powdered wives in bustled kimonos danced for their husbands, who smoked heavily. Their exhuberance was so deep that for a moment I wished I were Japanese."]

["books/review", "ON WRITERS AND WRITING; The Critic in Time of War - The New York Times It's easy to feel desperate about language right now. Words get maimed and flattened when we are struggling to think and feel the same way about catastrophes (murder and war), abstractions (freedom and civilization) and processes (history, say, and geopolitics) that are both subtle and harshly concrete. So many writers and artists keep asking what they can do, how they can be of use. We can be acutely responsive to and responsible for the meanings and powers of language. Words have literal, visceral and mythic meanings. How do their meanings change according to the speaker or the setting? What kind of language discourages questions? What kind begs us to answer back and keep asking? This is a time when the critical sensibility in all its forms should flourish. Oscar Wilde wrote: ''It seems to me that with the development of the critical spirit we shall be able to realize, not merely our own lives, but the collective life of the race, and so to make ourselves absolutely modern, in the true meaning of the word modernity. For he to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives. . . . To know anything about oneself one must know all about others. There must be no mood with which one cannot sympathize, no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive.''"]
["books/review", "I love this vision of the critical spirit. History cannot exist without the discipline of imagination. The moment counts as much as the hidebound custom; ways of feeling cannot be separated from ways of living. Every age and civilization realigns these elements. So does each new generation of artists. Abstraction and realism change places and proportions; so do narrative and poetic structures, line and color, consonance and dissonance. We take for granted our capacity to sympathize with all kinds of art. Wilde, an aesthete who was also a philosopher and social critic, believed we can do the same with other histories and cultures. The Roman playwright Terence said that nothing human was alien to him. I don't believe that exactly. But I do believe that if we are honest, nothing human is wholly incomprehensible to us. In all imaginative writing, sympathy for the subject is necessary not because it is the politically correct or morally decent posture, but because an absence of sympathy shuts down the mind; engagement fails, the flow of association dries up. What I mean by sympathy is simply that level of empathic understanding that endows the subject with dimensions -- the empathy that allows us, the readers, to see the others as the others might see themselves. This clearheaded definition comes from Vivian Gornick's new book, ''The Situation and the Story: The Art of Personal Narrative.'' It joins idealism to pragmatism in a way I find tonic. I also came across a German explanation of empathy in a mystery novel, ''You Who Know,'' by Nicolas Freeling. Freeling's perpetually rueful detective, Henri Castang, accompanied by his wife, Vera, is seeking information from a colleague on an elusive master criminal:"]
["books/review", "'' 'Empathy,' said General Bonacorsi. . . . 'Empathy, good German word which at present escapes me.' '' 'Einf\u00fchlung,' said Vera. '' 'Just so. Not that sappy feeling-with but the genuine feeling-into. The stepping, if need be slipping, into another's skin.' '' Criticism is a form of detective work in which empathy is subtle and exacting. It extends from the biographical and the psychological to the structure and texture of sounds, colors, notes. You find this kind of understanding in the writing of Roland Barthes, for instance, in such books as ''Mythologies'' and ''Music, Image.'' There was a time when American writers of all kinds complained that literature lacked weight or meaning in a prosperous, safe and indulged society like ours. Eastern Europe and Latin America were the favorite counterexamples, but Asia and Africa also were cited from time to time. Writing mattered in those places, it was said. It mattered so much that it could be censored or banned, and a writer could be imprisoned or exiled. Without pretending that most writers here run any such risks, we can insist that writing matters more than usual now. It can heighten our critical intelligence and our imaginations. It can provide ways of seeing and ordering the world -- not just our world, but those worlds elsewhere that we know so little of."]
["books/review", "The critic and historian C. L. R. James began writing a study of Herman Melville in 1952, while he was imprisoned on Ellis Island and fighting deportation from the United States. The charges changed from ''passport violations'' to ''subversive activities'' to ''Communist,'' and he was eventually deported. His book ''Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World We Live In'' was cited as one of the subversive activities. James was a vehemently independent socialist, a writer and intellectual in a high European tradition and a pioneering cultural critic whose subjects included television soap operas, cricket, movies and theater. (The nose of Jennifer Jones and why the young Vanessa Redgrave should play Edgar in ''King Lear'' mattered as much to him as an analysis of what mass audiences demand from popular art forms.) In his introduction and in a final chapter, he bound his passion for ''Moby-Dick'' directly to his experience on Ellis Island. (''The island, like Melville's Pequod, is a miniature of all the nations of the world and all sections of society.'') And he merged his reading of Melville with his reading of the modern world: totalitarianism (Nazism, then Soviet Communism), labor movements, colonial revolts, psychoanalysis. ''This is what Melville coordinates,'' he wrote, ''but as a world of human personalities, living as the vast majority of human beings live, not by ideas but by their emotions, seeking to avoid pain and misery and struggling for happiness.''"]

The Civil War, he wrote, was the first great war of modern times: ''The great Americans of the period preceding it knew that something was wrong, something deeper than slavery. . . . They probed into strange places and what they found they did not often fully understand. There were no precedents. It is only today when democracies and republics once more have to examine their foundations that the work of Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Garrison and Phillips and Melville can be fully understood.''

["dining/reviews", "Restaurant Review: Balaboosta in NoLITa - The New York Times SO here is a young woman sitting in Balaboosta with her parents, explaining the menu to them. She has a boyfriend in tow. The two sides of the table regard each other warily over mash-your-own hummus, as a votive candle flickers against the dusk. The restaurant, a charming and casual Middle Eastern trattoria with Israeli roots that Einat Admony opened near the top end of Little Italy this spring, seems to be filled with such pairings: fathers and daughters, mothers and boyfriends. The older people look around wide-eyed and curious, as if children themselves. The children deal with this as best they can. Interspersed among them are neighborhood couples, weeknight office groups, friends meeting friends under warm wood, beside bookcases and white brick. The talk is of babies and work, Uncle Murray and this summer\u2019s vacations. A pitcher of sangria slakes thirsts developed on the walk down Mulberry Street in the dank humidity of an early summer evening. Then a pizza resplendent in orange and green arrives. The orange is pur\u00e9ed carrot, spiked with the fire of chilies. The green is cilantro, laid over white clouds of goat cheese and lightning bolts of caramelized onion. The crust has a delicate skin that breaks open to reveal a chewy interior, deep in flavor, steaming hot. Possibly this is healthy food? It is addictive all the same."]
["dining/reviews", "Later, the boyfriend wolfs his dessert, a floral malabi to make Claudia Roden proud. (There\u2019s also a nice date and banana bread pudding.) He dabs at his mouth with a napkin, looks up at the parents in silence. They are drinking organic wine, of which the restaurant has a fine selection, inexpensive and interesting. There are some shy smiles. Who knows how it all will play out? Balaboosta, Ms. Admony has said, is  Yiddish for  \u201cperfect housewife.\u201d Quibblers will say it\u2019s a Yiddish corruption of the Hebrew term \u201cbaal habayit,\u201d  meaning the master of the house, or boss. The restaurant\u2019s bookcases are in any event filled with cookbooks written by women. A large portrait of an aunt decorates one wall. There is a small bar up front, serving wine but no spirits. Ms. Admony, who also has a popular West Village falafel joint, Taim, stands in the partly open kitchen, her glittering eyes darting everywhere, her dark hair pulled back beneath a kerchief. She runs Balaboosta exactly as if she\u2019d invited a room full of strangers for dinner, then told her family to be nice to them. The floor staff complies \u2014 they are professional, well versed in the menu, friendly, even kind. The intimate feel to the restaurant is real."]
["dining/reviews", "But there is very little that is housewifey about its owner and chef. Her eyes flick this way and that, cutting like knives. Ms. Admony smiles sometimes. She can definitely cook. There is that semi-completed hummus to start, whole chickpeas rising out of a tahini bath in a marble mortar, crushed chickpeas beneath them, ready to be finished with an accompanying pestle. Dip warm, herb-laden pita into the mixture, sparkly with lemon juice, fragrant with roasted garlic. Consumed, it provides a taste of an Israeli idyll, the feeling of a warm breeze off the Mediterranean to ruffle your hair. (If you have hair.) Then pop a few fried olives into your mouth, crisp and salty beneath their skin, or drag them through a drift of thick, house-made labneh to soften their crunch beneath the yogurt\u2019s tang. Have a ball of falafel wrapped around a tiny meatball, served with a green tahini sauce, a nod to Taim. Ms. Admony gently fries shrimp in a casing of shredded phyllo dough, then drizzles them with a dressing of flying-fish roe that accentuates the sweetness of the meat, the pure crunch of the coating. Three come to an appetizer plate. A moderately interested person could consume six and ask for more. There is an excellent dish of roasted cauliflower with currants and pine nuts, another of smoky eggplant on toast, with an herb salad dressed in a vivid citrus vinaigrette."]
["dining/reviews", "A honeydew and cantaloupe gazpacho with almond brittle and a jicama-mint relish sounds preposterous. But Ms. Admony\u2019s clever use of spice and heat to counter the fruit makes it a kind of summertime miracle, a soup you might want to eat for breakfast. (Or for that matter drink in the Nantucket high-summer  style, cut through with vodka, on a Wednesday afternoon.) Main courses can hardly compete against the starters and shareable plates. A fettuccine with tomato butter, zucchini, eggplant, sage and roasted garlic tastes studied and drab, redolent of  long shifts at the food co-op, a vegetarian mess. Lamb cooked three ways, with sunchoke pur\u00e9e and a Persian lime sauce, is perhaps two ways too many, though the soft sausage and chard-wrapped loin can do little to diminish the excellence of the roasted chop. And if slices of spice-crusted skirt steak are also wonderful, alongside a crisp and flavorful cumin slaw, there is still a thatch of gummy roasted sweet potatoes beside them, an underminer defined. (There are some roasted potatoes dusted with za\u2019atar available on the menu of shared plates, accompanied by garlic aioli, that are a far better mate for the beef.) Better is a grilled branzino with asparagus, fennel and a citrusy salad, the fish served with a lemon-spiked dill sauce. Beautifully cooked, and firm and flavorful on the bone, it helps explain the enormous popularity of this farmed European sea bass, a taste of the Mediterranean recaptured by science."]

["world/europe", "Impasse in Greece Could Force New Vote - The New York Times ATHENS \u2014 Greece\u2019s president will start negotiations Sunday to form a coalition government in a last-ditch effort to avoid new elections and further political turmoil. President Karolos Papoulias\u2019s announcement Saturday followed the collapse a day before of the third effort by individual parties to form unity governments. If the president\u2019s attempts to form a governing coalition fail \u2014 the most likely outcome, analysts say \u2014 he must appoint a caretaker government and call new elections within 30 days. The latest effort at unity failed when Alexis Tsipras, the ascendant leader of the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, said joining the proposed government would betray his party\u2019s rejection of the country\u2019s debt deal with foreign lenders, which was accepted by two of the parties that would be his partners. Although no party took a majority in elections last Sunday, forcing the attempts to form unity governments, Syriza did well enough to begin to change the debate over the tough and deeply unpopular austerity measures approved to win foreign aid. \u201cThe rejection of this proposal does not come from Syriza; it came from the Greek people,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said in a televised statement Friday referring to the large number of voters who supported anti-austerity parties."]
["world/europe", "Mr. Tsipras had been asked to join a unity government by the Socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos, the former finance minister who negotiated Greece\u2019s $170 billion loan deal with foreign creditors. Mr. Venizelos was the third party leader asked to try to form a new government after the election on Sunday. He had already drawn in the conservative New Democracy Party and the Democratic Left Party, a moderate left-wing party. But the Democratic Left said it would be part of a government only if Syriza joined. Mr. Tsipras called on the two parties that had supported the bailout deal, the Socialists, known as Pasok, and New Democracy, to \u201cstop playing with words\u201d and state outright whether they would curb austerity measures in a new government. \u201cWill it insist on cutting wages and pensions, yes or no? Will it insist on sacking thousands of people from civil service, yes or no?\u201d he said, referring to the proposed coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s as if New Democracy and Pasok did not understand the outcome of the elections.\u201d Mr. Tsipras described the proposed coalition partners as \u201cthree parties asking for implementation of the debt deal with a left-wing alibi,\u201d and called on Fotis Kouvelis, the Democratic Left leader, to keep his pledge not to join an alliance that excludes Syriza. Putting his rivals on the spot, Mr. Tsipras added of the loan agreement that \u201cno government is entitled to implement it.\u201d"]
["world/europe", "Since his party placed second behind New Democracy and bested the Socialists in Sunday\u2019s election, Mr. Tsipras has helped shift the debate to the point that the two parties are starting to call for a renegotiation of the loan agreement, responding to the popular groundswell. After its election loss, the Socialist Party, which led the country from 2009 until Prime Minister George A. Papandreou stepped down last fall, is in disarray. At a party meeting on Friday, Mr. Venizelos said the party \u201chad rotted\u201d and needed to be rebuilt, suggesting that a new and younger leadership would revive it. Polls indicate that Syriza, whose leader is 37 years old, would place first in new elections. As he worked in his family\u2019s cafe in Athens, Nikos Palavitsinis, 29, said he had voted for Syriza and admired Mr. Tsipras\u2019s grit. \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest thing for New Democracy and Pasok to put them on the spot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Tsipras was honest. He kept his word.\u201d A growing chorus of critics fear that if Syriza were to come to power and Greece failed to honor its international commitments, Europe would lose patience and stop lending the country money, prompting it to default and exit the euro zone. Without a \u201ccredible government,\u201d said Aristos Doxiades, a venture capitalist and economist, \u201cI think there will be default.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the Europeans will give us more than a couple of months\u2019 leeway,\u201d he added."]

["business/global", "Drone Sales Flourish in a Time of Austerity - The New York Times The use of unmanned drones for surveillance and targeted anti-guerrilla strikes has recently been a focus of ethical and political controversy. Yet for all the criticism, and at a time when austerity budgets are causing deep cuts in orders for manned combat, transport and tanker aircraft, drone builders are thriving. For defense planners and military strategists, the multiple mission capabilities of drones, their sophisticated technologies and their suitability for unconventional warfare gives them a clear edge over manned aircraft programs, which increasingly look like a holdover from Cold War planning. Ranging in size from hand-launched reconnaissance units for urban combat to giant experimental solar-powered surveillance craft intended to remain aloft for as long as five years, drones, formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or U.A.V.\u2019s, are not cheap, but they are increasingly ubiquitous. David Kilcullen, a counterinsurgency adviser who worked with Gen. David Petraeus of the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, said 70 nations were already involved with drones in some fashion. Michael Richter, head of aerospace and defense investment banking for the investment bank Lazard, in Los Angeles, said the U.S. budget sequestration law would cut U.S. defense spending to $551 billion next year from $587 billion this year, with a further fall in prospect to $505 billion in 2015 and 2016. Still, cybersecurity and drone programs are likely to be relatively resistant to cuts because of their perceived critical importance, he said."]
["business/global", "U.S. drones already in operational use include the hand-launched AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven, effectively a flying camera that provides support for troops in close combat, and the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, which can be programmed to operate almost autonomously, without a land-based controller. The Global Hawk can take off from California, fly across the United States to map the state of Maine, and then return to California. More familiar to the public because of high-profile strikes against Al Qaeda and other targets are General Atomics\u2019 MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper. Development programs include the Northrop Grumman X-47B, an experimental carrier-based combat drone. The program took a step forward recently with a catapult launching from the U.S. aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush, following successful on-shore tests of landings using arresting wires. Micah Zenko, a fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, said he expected that armed drones would be capable of carrying out carrier-based missions five years from now. Another high-technology venture is Boeing\u2019s Solar Eagle research program, slated to start testing next year and intended to develop an aircraft that could stay airborne for up to five years. Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm based in Fairfax, Virginia, said he expected the 2014 U.S. budget to propose reductions in existing drone programs in favor of \u201cnext generation systems, stealthier, with more power, and capable of operating autonomously if jammed by opponents.\u201d"]

Also emerging as future competitors, in Mr. Finnegan\u2019s view, are Turkish Aerospace Industries; Denel, the South African state-owned aerospace and defense technology group; and some Chinese companies. In the more traditional field of piloted military aircraft, some new players are aiming at niche segments with substantial long-term potential. A case in point is Embraer, of Brazil, which is adding both conventional military and unmanned flight capabilities to its core commercial aviation business. On the conventional military front, its KC-390 twin-jet tactical airlift and tanker plane is scheduled to make its first flight by the end of 2014, with entry into service planned for 2016. The KC-390 is aimed at a potential global market as large as $50 billion, according to Luiz Carlos Aguiar, head of Embraer\u2019s defense and security division. Mr. Aguiar said that the company was projecting $1.25 billion in military revenue this year, a 25 percent increase from 2012. His staff has identified 2,000 older aircraft in the KC-390\u2019s market segment, of which 723 are within Embraer\u2019s potential reach, leaving out markets closed to it by export controls or other factors. The program already holds 60 letters of intent from air forces in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic and Portugal."]
["business/global", "\u201cWe will soon announce possible future partnerships, including a joint study with Boeing,\u201d Mr. Aguiar said. On the unmanned aircraft front, Embraer holds a controlling interest in a joint venture with Avibras of Brazil and an Israeli company, aiming to build and sell drones for surveillance work to strengthen Brazilian border controls. For manned military aircraft, in contrast, the outlook is dour. For Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35, the stealthy so-called fifth generation multirole fighter plane that is the world\u2019s largest current military development program,  Richard Aboulafia, a vice president at Teal Group, anticipates that the U.S. Air Force procurement is \u201clikely to fall to around 1,200 to 1,400 units,\u201d barely half of current plans to buy more than 2,400 and far below the initially projected 3,100.

Britain, which is a partner in the program \u2014 BAE Systems has a 12 percent stake \u2014 has agreed to buy 138 units. Other buyers, for now, include Turkey, which could take 116 and potentially as many as 200; Australia, as many as 100; Italy, 90; Canada, 65; the Netherlands, 60 to 85; Norway, 56; Japan, 42; Denmark, 30; and Israel, 20.

["business", "Walmart Adjusts the Thermostat to Warm Worker Relations - The New York Times BENTONVILLE, Ark. \u2014 When the weather gets sultry here at company headquarters, Walmart workers everywhere brace for an icy blast. Because temperatures at Walmart stores across the United States are controlled remotely by the retailer\u2019s centralized systems here, employees stock shelves and tend to customers under conditions that, by many accounts, tend to be on the chilly side from one city to another. So at an employees\u2019 rally held here on Wednesday ahead of the retail giant\u2019s annual shareholders meeting this week, company executives made one of several concessions by agreeing to raise average store temperatures by 1 degree for the majority of Walmart locations. From adjusting the air-conditioning to relaxing the dress code and even jazzing up a store\u2019s music, the overtures \u2014 however small they seemed \u2014 are part of Walmart\u2019s effort to project an image of a more caring employer. A day earlier, Walmart, the country\u2019s largest private sector employer, said that it would raise the starting hourly wage for more than 100,000 managers in the United States. That was the second wave of wage increases at Walmart this year, after it announced in February that it would raise the pay for a half-million entry-level store workers. \u201cI love to listen to you, I love hearing what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t. I want to hear your ideas. I even like to hear your frustrations,\u201d Greg Foran, the head of Walmart\u2019s United States division, told about 3,000 store workers."]
["business", "\u201cOur job, my job, is to make your life easier,\u201d Mr. Foran said. Long a target of protests over low wages and rigid work schedules, Walmart is appearing to appease employees in the face of rising competition to hire and retain workers as the job market rebounds. Other retail chains, like Ikea and Gap, have also started to offer higher wages for store employees. Walmart is also trying to cast off an image as an exploitative employer with an army of minimum-wage workers, some of whom reportedly depend on food stamps or other government aid. Now, after the latest wage increases, all Walmart workers make above the minimum wage, the retailer says. Walmart also is trying to improve customer service as it struggles with sluggish sales at its supercenters and neighborhood markets. Sales at stores open for a year or more grew by just 1.1 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, though its performance over the last few quarters has improved slightly after a period of sales declines. Not all workers were impressed with the changes. And not all of them were in Bentonville at the company\u2019s invitation.

I think they should stop dancing round the boat.\u201d Kristin Oliver, Walmart\u2019s executive vice president in charge of human resources, acknowledged that workers harbored remaining concerns, and said Walmart was working on more flexible scheduling. She also said the company hoped that the combination of higher wages and friendlier policies would make its work force less transitory, and more likely to build careers with the retailer. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last few years is people jumping for small wage increases. People will move from one retailer to another for 25 cents an hour,\u201d Ms. Oliver said. \u201cWhat we hope is going to happen with the investments we\u2019ve made is to slow that down.\u201d To entice workers to stay, Walmart on Wednesday announced a number of other changes to its employee policies. The retailer will ease a much-criticized dress code that had required store workers, even those in physically intensive jobs, to wear shirts, vests and khakis. Now, stockers and other back-of-store workers will be allowed to wear jeans and T-shirts. Service-oriented workers will also be able to expand their choice of pants to black or khaki-colored denim."]

And temperatures at stores in the East and central regions will rise to 75 degrees from 74. (In stores in the West, average temperatures will fall from 76 to 75.)

["sports/baseball", "Reliable Fill-In Sputters, Along With Yankees\u2019 Offense - The New York Times Even with the Yankees in first place in their division, Manager Joe Girardi understands that his ball club must be handled delicately, given the advanced age of some of his players, the inexperience of others, and the team\u2019s relievers, who have been overworked early in the season. Saturday\u2019s game against the Orioles, a 6-2 loss at Yankee Stadium, amplified the difficulties of Girardi\u2019s balancing act. When Alex Rodriguez\u2019s legs were feeling tight after Friday\u2019s game, Girardi did not risk putting him in the lineup with the Yankees in the middle of a stretch of 17 straight games. In the morning, Girardi also essentially decided that Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller, who had already pitched on consecutive days, would not be used out of the bullpen. Then, after the game began, he realized that he probably could not yet depend on Chase Whitley to provide a quality outing every five days. After two solid outings, Whitley gave up five runs, including three home runs, in five and two-thirds innings and was charged with his first loss this season. Entering the game, Whitley had given up one earned run in 12 innings. \u201cHe was just a little bit off today,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cPitchers aren\u2019t going to be perfect. They\u2019re going to make some mistakes.\u201d The Orioles did not let Whitley get ahead of them early in the count.

Pitching from behind for the first time this season, Whitley hit Steve Pearce, who batted after Davis, and two batters later, he gave up a two-run homer to Alejandro De Aza. After having allowed one walk in his first two starts, Whitley issued two walks Saturday and hit Adam Jones with a pitch in the fifth inning. Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen threw a more precise game, stifling the Yankees over seven innings, allowing one run on five hits with seven strikeouts for his first win of the season. \u201cHe got us to chase up in the zone a little bit today, and that\u2019s the one thing I talked about that you need to lay off against him,\u201d Girardi said. At times, Whitley has looked just as dominant: on April 28 against the Tampa Bay Rays, and again on Monday while facing the Toronto Blue Jays. With Masahiro Tanaka\u2019s lingering right arm issues keeping him off the mound, the Yankees are in need of quality innings from Whitley, who was supposed to make only a spot start when he was called up on April 28. Despite his rough outing, Whitley will most likely have another chance this week.

Carpenter was victimized by some shoddy fielding in the seventh. Paredes led off the inning with a triple after the ball bounced off the glove of right fielder Chris Young. He scored after Young misjudged a fly ball off the bat of Delmon Young. With a chance to atone in the eighth, Chris Young struck out with runners on first and second. Jacoby Ellsbury, who entered Saturday with an 11-game hitting streak, went 0 for 5. More runs may be on the horizon. Girardi said he anticipated that Rodriguez, who is second on the team with 19 R.B.I., would be in Sunday\u2019s lineup.

The mistaken attack came after a military plane targeted an area crowded with people fleeing Boko Haram militants. Medical workers were scrambling on Wednesday to assemble equipment to treat dozens of severely injured people who were still awaiting evacuation from the camp in Rann, in northeastern Nigeria. At least 120 people were hurt in the errant strike on Tuesday by the Nigerian Air Force at the camp, which is near the Cameroon border and houses about 20,000 people. Initial reports put the death toll around 50.

Among them were two young children: a 7-year-old named Yaa Zara with a fractured arm and Kaka Hauwa, 5, whose neck was injured. One of the blasts was so forceful it knocked out two of Kaka\u2019s teeth, the children\u2019s mother, Fati Yasin, 35, said on Tuesday.

The bomb struck around noon Tuesday, just as aid workers were vaccinating children in the camp for measles and screening them for malnutrition, according to a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders. In the wake of the bombing, human rights groups were trying to assess how the military could have mistaken such a crowded camp for Boko Haram fighters. A terrorism and counterterrorism researcher for Human Rights Watch circulated on Twitter an aerial view of the encampment dotted with tents and other structures. It is situated near a Nigerian military post. The Nigerian military has been engaged in a fierce battle against Boko Haram, which has ties to the Islamic State, for years. Civilians have often borne the brunt of the war against Boko Haram as soldiers have been accused of rounding up and killing innocent people they suspected of being militants. The military has also been accused of accidentally killing civilians in airstrikes in the past. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has declared victory over the militants on several occasions. But the conflict endures, even though military operations have made huge progress killing and arresting hundreds of fighters. On Tuesday, Mr. Buhari said he regretted the error, and Nigerian military officials also expressed remorse, acknowledging they had targeted the wrong spot."]

["books/review", "Bob Mankoff\u2019s \u2018How About Never \u2014 Is Never Good for You?\u2019 - The New York Times Bob Mankoff is The New Yorker\u2019s cartoon editor as well as a cartoonist himself. \u201cI may not have the best job in the world, but I\u2019m in the running,\u201d he writes in the introduction to his book \u201cHow About Never \u2014 Is Never Good for You? My Life in Cartoons,\u201d which is not just a charming memoir but also a charming grab bag of cartoon history, cartoon theory (nothing too woolly) and shoptalk. The title is taken from Mankoff\u2019s best-known drawing. Businessman on phone, consulting datebook: \u201cNo, Thursday\u2019s out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?\u201d As its author points out \u2014 false modesty is not one of his faults \u2014 that line has entered the vernacular, alongside other classics from the magazine such as \u201cI say it\u2019s spinach, and I say the hell with it\u201d (drawing by Carl Rose, caption by E. B. White); \u201cWell, back to the old drawing board\u201d (Peter Arno); and \u201cOn the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog\u201d (Peter Steiner). Like any true artist, Mankoff ap\u00adproaches his craft with love and rigor. \u201cI take cartoons very seriously, and I expect the people who draw them to do the same,\u201d he warns. In the mid-1970s, when he himself was already a graduate school dropout (psychology) and a published cartoonist (Saturday Review) but not yet a New Yorker cartoonist, Mankoff spent days in the New York Public Library poring over bound volumes of the magazine, all the way back to its birth in 1925, in an effort to crack the code. His conclusion: New Yorker cartoons could be many things, but at bottom \u201cthey made the reader think.\u201d"]
["books/review", "I should note, as Mankoff does, that The New Yorker didn\u2019t invent the captioned, single-panel cartoon, but under the magazine\u2019s auspices the form was modernized and perfected; Arno, for one, ought to be as celebrated as Picasso and Matisse, or at least Ernst Lubitsch. But if The New Yorker has long been the pinnacle, \u201cthe Everest of magazine cartooning,\u201d as Mankoff puts it, the surrounding landscape has become more of a game preserve, with a sad, thinned herd of outlets. In olden days, when rejected drawings could be pawned off on, among many others, The Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, Ladies\u2019 Home Journal or National Lampoon, a young cartoonist could afford the years it might take to breach The New Yorker \u2014 Mankoff himself made some 2,000 total submissions before he sold his first drawing to the magazine, in 1977. Today there are probably more people alive who speak Gullah or know how to thatch a roof than there are first-rate panel cartoonists. As the art form\u2019s primary gatekeeper since 1997, when he succeeded Lee Lorenz as The New Yorker\u2019s cartoon editor, Mankoff is aware of his dual, at times conflicting, responsibilities: maintaining standards but doing a bit more diapering, burping and kitchy-kitchy-kooing than was previously thought advisable. \u201cIf New Yorker cartoons weren\u2019t going to become museum pieces,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe were going to have to be the minor leagues as well as the majors. . . . In the past, \u2018close\u2019 had always meant \u2018close but no cigar\u2019 \u2014 in other words, not quite good enough to win the prize of getting into The New Yorker. However, now close could be good enough.\u201d And a good thing, too, since what Mankoff calls \u201caffirmative action\u201d has brought on board some of the funniest, most original cartoonists in the magazine\u2019s current bullpen, including Matthew Diffee, Alex Gregory and Zachary Kanin."]
["books/review", "Of course, one editor\u2019s close but no cigar is another editor\u2019s Montecristo; subjectivity is the whole humidor when it comes to the \u201cgossamer\u201d quality of a New Yorker cartoon. I\u2019m not quoting Mankoff there but rather a fictional Mr. Elinoff, The New Yorker\u2019s cartoon editor in a 1998 \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode about the alleged ungettability of the magazine\u2019s wit. That charge rankles Mankoff, and spurs him to a discussion of what makes a cartoon funny or not \u2014 potentially as arid a subject as the endless deserts cartoon protagonists still crawl across, one hand raised, in search of . . . \u201cWater!\u201d Though he twice quotes E. B. White\u2019s famous warning \u2014 Analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested and the frog dies of it \u2014 Mankoff can be as clinical as anyone when he so chooses, noting, for instance, that \u201can enigmatic image in need of humorous clarification by a one-line caption became the hallmark of New Yorker cartoons.\u201d I prefer this observation, one of the sharpest things I\u2019ve ever read about what goes into being funny, spun from a remembrance of Mankoff\u2019s youth as a class clown in 1950s Queens: \u201cActing outrageously makes it that much easier to think unconventionally. If you don\u2019t have a silly bone in your body, you\u2019re not going to have a funny bone, \u00adeither. And if you can\u2019t combine a mature intelligence with some immature thinking, you\u2019re never going to be funny enough to make a living at it.\u201d"]
["books/review", "As fans of his Cartoon Bureau blog know, that\u2019s Mankoff at his best: lucid, illuminating and encouraging \u2014 encouraging in the sense that, contra White, you may still want to look at a few cartoons after closing this book. There are plenty here as well, by Mankoff and his colleagues, past and present, illustrating various points about drawing, writing and editing. The point is, cartoons are work, and given what his job entails, it\u2019s a miracle Mankoff\u2019s funny bone hasn\u2019t been ground down to mildly amused splinters. Each week, he writes, he sifts through approximately 500 submissions from the magazine\u2019s regular cartoonists, plus another 500 from hopefuls. That 1,000 gets culled to 50 or so, which he takes to The New Yorker\u2019s editor, David Remnick, who then selects the 17 or so that will see print. (At 1.7 percent, that\u2019s a smaller acceptance rate than Stanford\u2019s 5.07.) As an experiment, to see whether my own sense of humor could withstand a similar battering of ink washes, Rapidograph lines and animals acting like Upper West Siders, I spent an afternoon with three of the magazine\u2019s recent \u201cCartoons of the Year\u201d annuals, plowing through more than 800 drawings. After a paltry 100 or so, genuine pleasure gave way to intellectual recognition that a given cartoon might, in a technical sense, be humorous, but this recognition was devoid of actual mirth; I was Spock on \u201cStar Trek,\u201d acknowledging human emotion but not feeling it. And then boom: At around 600 cartoons, I was a marathoner breaking through \u201cthe wall,\u201d or someone at a Grateful Dead concert whose acid trip peaks just as the band segues into \u201cSt. Stephen\u201d \u2014 I reached a kind of cartoon flow-state, a punch-line-induced freeing of the mind. Now, everything was funny. Honestly, I can\u2019t imagine how Mankoff does it."]
["books/review", "In part, his book can be read as a defense of his stewardship \u2014 mostly inspired, I think \u2014 of the national treasure that is the New Yorker cartoon. To the perennial gripe that the cartoons aren\u2019t as funny as they used to be, Mankoff\u2019s short answer is: \u201cThey never were.\u201d It\u2019s true. I conducted another experiment, pulling three random issues of the magazine off local library shelves, from 1933, 1965 and 1997; each batch of vintage cartoons produced the same amount of chuckles, snorts of recognition, mehs, groans and huh?\u2019s as would those in any recent issue (minus jokes at the expense of Africans, Native Americans, Gypsies, Jews and wives who won\u2019t shut up). Mankoff believes that people tend to forget cartoons they didn\u2019t like, remembering only the keepers, which gives the past a perpetual leg up. Plus \u00e7a change, as they say. Which could be a New Yorker cartoon caption itself \u2014 maybe for a George Booth drawing of two bored codgers sitting on the porch of a shack in the middle of nowhere? Not bad, if I say so myself. Definitely beats the one Elaine came up with in that \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode, a pig at a complaint window saying, \u201cI wish I was taller.\u201d By the way, there are still complaint windows in New Yorker cartoons, along with suggestion boxes, post-coital cigarettes, mobsters with their feet in tubs of cement and, fortunately for castaways, desert islands.

["sports/cycling", "A Double Standard in Doping Punishments - The New York Times What does it take to receive a lifetime ban from cycling for breaking antidoping rules? I\u2019ll tell you what won\u2019t get you one. You can be Johan Bruyneel, Lance Armstrong\u2019s former team manager, and be what arbitrators said was \u201cat the apex of a conspiracy to commit widespread doping\u201d on multiple teams spanning many years and many riders. You can be Pepe Mart\u00ed, Armstrong\u2019s former team trainer, and sell and transport drugs and blood-doping equipment to a multitude of cyclists, offer them new banned doping products and even mail drugs to them. You can be Pedro Celaya, Armstrong\u2019s former team doctor, and inject riders with banned drugs like EPO and cortisone, oversee banned blood transfusions and help riders evade positive tests. For those egregious transgressions, an arbitration panel ruled Monday that Bruyneel would be barred from cycling for 10 years and Mart\u00ed and Celaya would be barred for eight. As it turns out, the only thing that gets you a lifetime ban for doping in cycling these days is being Lance Armstrong. Actually, that\u2019s an exaggeration. Two doctors involved with Armstrong\u2019s United States Postal Service team \u2014 Michele Ferrari and Luis Garc\u00eda del Moral \u2014 accepted lifetime bans as he did in the summer of 2012, when Armstrong finally gave up fighting and agreed to the sanction for doping and encouraging doping on his teams."]
["sports/cycling", "But the fact that Armstrong can never again compete in an Olympic sport, while three of the people who helped facilitate doping in the peloton will be free to return in eight years or less, because the bans are retroactive, is an unacceptable double standard. By virtue of their potential longevity in the sport and their continued face-to-face contact with riders, Bruyneel, Mart\u00ed and Celaya perhaps pose much more of a danger to cycling than Armstrong ever did. They had \u2014 and may have again \u2014 the potential to directly perpetuate the sport\u2019s drug culture from team to team, even to another generation of riders. Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said ridding the sport of those enablers and \u201cdismantling the system\u201d was his agency\u2019s goal in the first place. Usada, which brought the case against the three punished Monday, had proposed lifetime bans for all of them. \u201cThose support personnel should have been the first people standing up for the athletes, not the ones providing them drugs, influencing them to use drugs and allowing those athletes to think it\u2019s acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy the arbitration panel didn\u2019t go for life sentences because of that, I can\u2019t answer that. All I can say is that we pushed for those life bans, and we certainly think life bans were in order.\u201d So why a life ban for Armstrong and not for three of his henchmen? Supposedly it\u2019s all about nuances. The arbitration panel called the Postal Service\u2019s doping case \u201cone of the most complex antidoping prosecutions ever brought.\u201d"]
["sports/cycling", "For starters, there was an eight-year statute of limitations that kept the evidence in the cases of Bruyneel, Mart\u00ed and Celaya limited to information about their involvement in doping after June 12, 2004. That excluded the testimony of riders like David Zabriskie Michael Barry and Tyler Hamilton, who were key witnesses in the case against Armstrong. Floyd Landis\u2019s testimony was also not considered because of the time limit, but also because he was \u201cfraught with credibility issues.\u201d In the end, the testimony of only three former Postal Service riders \u2014 George Hincapie, Tom Danielson and Levi Leipheimer \u2014 was considered in the arbitration case. Hincapie\u2019s testimony against Bruyneel was a sliver of information, only his recollection of Bruyneel\u2019s calling him to check Armstrong\u2019s apartment for drugs. Danielson, though, provided vivid detail of Bruyneel\u2019s, Mart\u00ed\u2019s and Celaya\u2019s involvement in his doping, including Mart\u00ed\u2019s shipping him EPO for the 2006 Tour of California, Mart\u00ed and Celaya\u2019s helping him with blood transfusions and Bruyneel\u2019s overseeing it all from \u201can organizational standpoint.\u201d The arbitration panel could have supported Usada\u2019s proposal for lifetime bans for all three defendants but chose not to. In Armstrong\u2019s case, antidoping experts say, he received the maximum because he did not go to arbitration. There, Usada\u2019s suggested lifetime ban could possibly have been reduced. Those experts also say that Armstrong\u2019s case was not affected by the statute of limitations because he had lied under oath about his doping and facilitated a vast cover-up of it before Usada finally revealed the truth."]
["sports/cycling", "Knowing what we know from the Bruyneel case, if Armstrong had fought his lifetime ban, it is possible that arbitrators would have given him eight or 10 years, too. But it\u2019s too late for that. It\u2019s not too late, though, for Bruyneel, Mart\u00ed and Celaya to be barred for life, and for the punishments in the Postal Service antidoping case to seem fair in comparison to one another. For that to happen, Usada, the World Anti-Doping Agency or the International Cycling Union would have to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. (The defendants also could appeal.) Bruyneel, in a message posted on his personal website, said he was considering his legal options and contended that he and \u201ca very small minority of us has been used as scapegoats for an entire generation.\u201d Tygart said that Usada would probably not appeal unless there was new evidence, and that the agency was satisfied with the outcome. The World Anti-Doping Agency said it was reviewing the arbitration panel\u2019s decision. But, really, it\u2019s the cycling union that should look at this as an opportunity to prove how serious it is about cleaning up its sport. While to some eight- and 10-year bans might seem harsh enough, protecting the sport\u2019s future and its athletes should be paramount. If this case \u2014 involving a proven doping kingpin, a drug trafficker and a doctor who facilitated doping \u2014 doesn\u2019t warrant taking a stand for clean athletes, what will?"]

The proposal came on the same day that South Korea pledged to donate $13.3 million to help the World Food Program and the World Health Organization provide nutrients, medicine and other urgent assistance for malnourished babies and nursing mothers in the North. In a message delivered across the border on Monday, the South\u2019s Unification Ministry suggested that the two governments hold high-level talks on Aug. 19 at Panmunjom, the border village where the armistice ending the Korean War was signed in 1953. The two Koreas held their last high-level meeting in February. During that meeting, they put aside several years of high tensions incited by the North\u2019s nuclear tests and armed provocations against the South and reached an agreement that allowed hundreds of people from both sides to meet their long-lost relatives for the first time since the war. South Korea hopes to arrange a new round of family reunions around Chuseok, the Korean Thanksgiving holiday on Sept. 8 that is a traditional time for family gatherings. There was no immediate response from the North. The reunions in February were the first in three years. Since then, North Korea has escalated its hostility toward the South, calling its president, Park Geun-hye, a prostitute. The country has also conducted unusually frequent tests of missiles and rockets in recent weeks."]

No telephone, letter or email exchanges are allowed between the citizens of the two Koreas while thousands of people, mostly in their 80s or older, wait for a chance to see their family members before they die. North Korea had often stalled earlier talks with a demand that the South cancel annual military exercises with the United States. The two allies are scheduled to begin one such drill this month.

One morning last week, on the second-to-last day of the month of Strawberry Rhubarb and Thyme \u2014 otherwise known as April; the flavor changes every month \u2014 a man named Thao stood at the front of the neatly assembled crowd. He was visiting from Vietnam, and had arrived at 5:30 that morning. At 7:36 a.m. there were 35 people lined up, including a baby in a stroller. The line was nearly half a block long. In the middle of the procession stood an older, serious-looking man named Greg Ingram, who was in town on business from Atlanta. \u201cIf people are still lining up, there must be something about it,\u201d Ingram said. But also: \u201cWhat else are you going to do at 7 in the morning?\u201d Like any decadent cultural phenomenon worth its salt \u2014 or, haha, sugar \u2014 the Cronut, when it debuted in May 2013, was an immediate source of both fascination and derision. \u201cAfter the third day, we had a hundred people waiting outside,\u201d Dominique Ansel, the Cronut\u2019s creator, told me recently. The lines outside Ansel\u2019s bakery seemed to embody all that was wrong with New York in its new Gilded Age: its vulnerability to hype and its willingness to pay obscene prices and endure penitential inconveniences at the hands of culinary auteurs. Almost immediately after the Cronut\u2019s debut, a Craigslist-based black-market economy of Cronut scalpers materialized, charging between $20 and $40 per Cronut. At the height of the craze, one group of scalpers was charging $100 per Cronut and $5,000 for a 20-piece order."]

Soon after, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts introduced the carefully titled Croissant Donut, while bringing out a similar product in South Korea called the New York Pie Donut.

Each flavor is topped with a different color of frosting, and each pastry is packed delicately, an elegant box in an elegant bag.

As much as New Yorkers might want to believe otherwise, not everyone waiting in Ansel\u2019s line is a tourist \u2014 at least according to Ansel. Seventy percent of Cronut consumers, he estimated, are locals.

Jessica admitted her bafflement at other phenomena requiring line-waiting, like Shakespeare in the Park, but appreciated the order Ansel imposed at his bakery. \u201cThank God there\u2019s a process,\u201d she said. Ansel\u2019s security guard came out and counted everyone in line. The Cronut line, he explained to us, was just for Cronuts.

But they have already caught them cheating. Still, there was neither shock nor outrage in the Yankees\u2019 clubhouse on Tuesday afternoon after the The New York Times revealed that Major League Baseball agreed with a Yankees claim that the Red Sox had violated league rules by using electronics to help steal signals. What Yankee players did convey was a general sense of satisfaction that the Red Sox had been caught in their misdeeds and now stood embarrassed in front of the rest of the sport. But genuine anger at what Boston had done? No. \u201cIf you\u2019re not cheating, you\u2019re not trying,\u201d said a shrugging C. C.

It\u2019s been going on forever. It\u2019s up to us to protect our signs.\u201d The Times article detailed how the Yankees sent video evidence to M.L.B. to back up their contention that the Red Sox used an Apple Watch to quickly relay information from their video staff to an assistant trainer in the dugout to players on the field. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into specifics, but it\u2019s something that we suspected,\u201d Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said before the Yankees played the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night."]
["sports/baseball", "It is not illegal to steal signs, and for some players and coaches, it amounts to an art. But it is illegal in baseball to use electronics or binoculars in the process. The Red Sox admitted their transgression to baseball investigators, and also alleged that the Yankees were using a YES network camera to do the same, which the Yankees quickly denied. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner said of Boston\u2019s counterclaim. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of silly.\u201d Girardi was more blunt. \u201cNo chance,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Girardi said the Yankees not only worried only about the Red Sox. He said he spends time during games looking around to detect methods of cheating elsewhere, too. The Yankees have long suspected the Toronto Blue Jays of relaying signals from their outfield, and during the 2015 playoffs, the Kansas City Royals also accused the Blue Jays. Gardner, meanwhile, admitted he once was picked off first base because he was so intent on peering in to the catcher to get the signs. After the pickoff, he stopped doing so. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game within a game,\u201d he said of the effort to steal signs. \u201cBut obviously, the use of electronics, whatever was going on with them, I guess some kind of watch, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty frowned upon.\u201d Most teams use different sets of signs to make it more difficult to steal them. They may use them when opposing players are on base, or in opposing ballparks where they suspect illicit methods are being used to decipher signals."]
["sports/baseball", "\u201cWe assume that everyone is doing it, just to protect ourselves,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that everyone is doing it. But as a team, we assume that everyone is trying to do something.\u201d Asked if the Yankees are trying to steal signs within legal means, Girardi responded, \u201cYou can assume what you want.\u201d Girardi also said sign-stealing efforts contribute to pace-of-game issues because nervous teams repeatedly send their catchers to the mound \u2014 not for strategic conferences but to discuss which signs to use. Austin Romine, a Yankees catcher, said the threat of sign stealing had led the Yankees to take extra precautions at Fenway Park. \u201cNow you know why there are so many mound visits,\u201d he said. To speed things along and combat the espionage, Girardi suggested using some form of electronic communication between the catcher, pitcher and middle infielders, whether a headset like what quarterbacks use in the N.F.L. or a version of text messaging. \u201cElectronics is the world we live in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has changed the world we live in.

["sports/baseball", "M.L.B. Postseason Has Home Here, There, Everywhere - The New York Times Major League Baseball\u2019s television schedule is crammed with five networks each carrying pieces of the postseason: TBS, Fox, Fox Sports 1, ESPN and MLB Network. TBS, Fox and Fox Sports 1 will carry most of the games. ESPN showed one (Tuesday night\u2019s Yankees-Astros wild-card game) and MLB Network will carry two American League division series games. TBS will televise Wednesday night\u2019s National League wild-card game. How the schedule got this way is a tale worth retelling. M.L.B. expanded its playoff system in 2012 by adding a second wild card to each league. From 1995 through 2011, the one wild-card team in each league played in a division series. Since then, the two wild-card teams in each league have faced each other in a single game for the right to play in a division series. The idea was to keep more teams in contention for the postseason while increasing the value of a division title. TBS, which had the rights to all division series games and one League Championship Series, snapped up the two new wild-card games in 2012 and 2013 for a few million dollars each year. Having added those games led to another deal that shifted two of the division series games from TBS to MLB Network. The deal making over those games occurred months before M.L.B. negotiated new contracts, which began in 2014, with all its network partners."]
["sports/baseball", "ESPN, seeing the value of playoff elimination games, pushed hard to acquire one of the wild-card games in its new contract. Each is worth at least $15 million. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us because it\u2019s our postseason game,\u201d said Burke Magnus, executive vice president for programming and scheduling for ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s how we look at it. Being a consistent partner of baseball\u2019s through the regular season, we get to pay it off with a postseason game. And we drove a big audience last year\u201d \u2014 5.6 million viewers for San Francisco\u2019s 8-0 win over Pittsburgh. \u201cI know M.L.B. wanted us to have some skin in the game relative to the postseason,\u201d Magnus added. Last season represented the triumph of the wild-card system. The two wild-card winners, San Francisco and Kansas City, faced each other in a terrific World Series that lasted seven games. TBS emerged from the new deal with two division series; Fox and Fox Sports 1 took the other two. Fox also acquired the right to show League Championship Series games on Fox Sports 1 (and put five of the six N.L.C.S. games on the cable network). TBS still shows one L.C.S. MLB Network preserved its two division series games in a transaction worth about $30 million a year. For MLB Network, playoff games are attention-getters for a niche channel. \u201cThis is the way you grow networks, to get more distribution,\u201d said the MLB Network president, Rob McGlarry. \u201cHow do we create awareness, how do we create more value for our distributor and the network?\u201d Along with the hope of adding more subscribers, the games produce extra advertising by being the network\u2019s most-viewed telecasts each year."]
["sports/baseball", "But MLB Network has a disadvantage distinct among the postseason networks: It is shown in 67 million households, well below the universes of TBS (94.5 million), ESPN (91.8 million) and Fox Sports 1 (84.4 million). MLB Network averaged 1.8 million viewers for its division series games last year \u2014 doubling its 2013 audience \u2014 but much less than the 3.57 million for TBS\u2019s division series games and 3.1 million for Fox Sports 1\u2019s telecasts. MLB Network will carry Game 2 of the Texas-Toronto series and the second game of the series between Kansas City and Houston or the Yankees. Baseball clearly understood the networks\u2019 audiences when it allotted the wild-card games to ESPN and TBS, with their sudden-death quality, and the division series telecasts to its own channel."]

They want him to preach about corruption, living in peace and governing fairly. But as Pope Francis begins his first trip to Africa on Wednesday, he will also face a powerful and assertive Roman Catholic Church in Africa that is wary of calls to make the institution more welcoming to people who are divorced, gay or cohabiting without being married. \u201cYes, we are more conservative,\u201d said Bishop Renatus Leonard Nkwande, of the Tanzanian diocese of Bunda. The African bloc\u2019s role, he said, is \u201cto defend the teaching of the church, the teaching of the book.\u201d Both Africa and Francis himself, the first pope from Latin America, symbolize the importance of the southern hemisphere to the future of the Catholic Church worldwide. The church in Africa is booming in numbers, strength and influence, and the Roman Catholic Church globally is sitting up and taking notice. Africans now account for 14 percent of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics, but by 2050 they will be 25 to 30 percent, according to Philip Jenkins, a professor at Baylor University who studies global Christianity."]
["world/africa", "Yet Francis faces some stiff resistance on the continent to his calls for a more tolerant church. When bishops met last month at the Vatican for a pivotal international meeting, or synod, on the family, the African bishops gained attention for the assertive role they played in pushing the church to stand firm against any acceptance of divorce and homosexuality. The African prelates see eye-to-eye with Francis on several of his signature themes \u2014 poverty, the environment and social injustice \u2014 that he is likely to evoke during his trip to Kenya, Uganda and the war-torn Central African Republic this week. But African bishops are also seen as an increasingly powerful counterweight to bishops in Western Europe and the Americas backing Francis\u2019s call to make the church more open to unconventional families. The Rev. Boniface Mwangi, a director for Caritas in central Kenya, an association of Catholic charities, said he expected the Pope to steer away from the contentious topics gripping some Catholics in the West, like whether to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion, or what to do about gay parishioners.  As many as 36 African countries have laws against homosexuality, including the three Francis is set to visit. \u201cI expect him to focus on social issues of the common people, like why we have some pockets with people who have huge resources and so many other people live in slums,\u201d Father Mwangi said. Catholics in Africa are eager to welcome the pontiff and share the spotlight he will bring to their faith and their struggles."]
["world/africa", "In Kenya and Uganda, those challenges include vicious attacks from radical Islamist extremists who have killed hundreds of civilians at an upscale shopping mall, a public university and in villages along the coast, often separating Christians from Muslims and slaughtering the Christians. The Central African Republic, an impoverished country in the middle of the continent, has been roiled for years by a war between Muslims and Christians that has killed thousands and chased nearly a million from their homes. Pope Francis said in a video released last weekend that he planned to deliver in Africa a message of \u201creconciliation, forgiveness and peace.\u201d Security for the trip is an urgent concern. Catholic observers say the visit to the Central African Republic ranks among the most dangerous trips a pope has ever undertaken. \u201cThe pope wants to go to the Central African Republic,\u201d a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said in a media briefing last week. \u201cAnd, like any wise person would do, we are monitoring the situation.\u201d Kenyans are yearning to hear Pope Francis address \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d and denounce corruption by their political leaders, according to a new poll there. Corruption is the top public issue in Kenya right now, with new scandals erupting almost daily \u2014 from allegations of Kenyan generals making millions of dollars smuggling sugar to accusations that officials in one government ministry bought ballpoint pens for $85 apiece."]
["world/africa", "What could make it awkward for Pope Francis is that the corruption plaguing Kenya has been carried out, according to numerous claims, by members of the same government that is placing the red carpet under his feet. The pope\u2019s first scheduled activity will be a \u201cwelcoming ceremony\u201d with Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta. Father Mwangi said the pope should wrap his anticorruption message in what the Bible says about integrity. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be political,\u201d he said. \u201cGood governance is about integrity.\u201d Despite, or perhaps because of, these social conditions, the church in Africa is thriving. \u201cThey\u2019re moving the church in a conservative direction on moral and social issues, but a liberal direction on economic issues and social justice,\u201d Professor Jenkins said. This change is reflected not just in the Roman Catholic Church, but also in the Anglican Communion, the world\u2019s third-largest body of churches. Powerful Anglican bishops in Africa joined forces with theological conservatives in the United States and England to oppose decisions by Anglican provinces in the United States, Canada and elsewhere to ordain openly gay bishops and bless same-sex marriages. Recognizing that the communion is on the verge of fracture, the archbishop of Canterbury has called a meeting for January to discuss its future. The United Methodist Church, a predominantly American church with a growing branch in Africa, is also deeply divided on gay issues. At the church\u2019s conferences, the voting bloc of African delegates, which grows larger with each successive conference, has united with American conservatives to defeat the proposals by liberal Methodists to ordain gay ministers and bless same-sex marriages."]
["world/africa", "Homosexuality has proved to be an \u201cexplosive issue\u201d for churches in Africa, said Professor Jenkins, in part because \u201cChristianity faces such competition from Islam in Africa.\u201d \u201cIf Christianity ever became more liberal on gay issues, Catholic leaders say they would just seem to be selling out to the West, betraying African values and just giving the whole thing to Islam,\u201d he added. In the Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches, African leaders have argued that initiatives to force them to accept gay relationships are a form of neocolonialism imposed by Europeans and Americans. They argue that the reason their churches are growing, compared to the declines they see in their churches in Europe and the United States, is that the African churches have upheld traditional doctrines on sexuality. At the synod last month, Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea grabbed headlines with a speech that equated gay rights with terrorism. He said both were \u201capocalyptic beasts\u201d with a \u201cdemonic origin.\u201d \u201cWhat Nazi-fascism and communism were in the 20th century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today,\u201d said Cardinal Sarah, who has served in the Vatican for years and was named to the top liturgical post there by Francis in 2014. Another African cardinal, Wilfrid Fox Napier, of South Africa, was among what were reported to be about a dozen bishops who signed a private letter to Francis objecting to the committee the pope had appointed to draft the synod\u2019s final document. The signers suggested that the committee was stacked with prelates who would favor reforming the church\u2019s practice of refusing communion to those who have divorced and remarried without an annulment."]

He has not spoken directly on the hot-button issues the synod left unsettled, but Francis has repeatedly called for a more open and merciful church, doing so again last week during his weekly audience in St. Peter\u2019s Square. \u201cThe house of God is a refuge, not a prison!\u201d he said in an impassioned, off-the-cuff address. \u201cAnd if the door is closed, we say: \u2018Lord, open the door!\u2019\u00a0\u201d He has made \u201cmercy\u201d the leitmotif of his papacy, declaring a yearlong \u201cJubilee of Mercy\u201d that he plans to start off in Bangui, the Central African Republic capital, by ceremonially opening the holy door of the cathedral there."]

Trial Opens Over Defect Claim - The New York Times While acknowledging its role in failing to report a deadly defect for more than a decade, General Motors on Tuesday forcefully questioned the story of a man who was injured in a May 2014 crash and is suing the company. The automaker is facing a civil trial in the first of six so-called bellwether cases over deadly defective ignition switches in its vehicles. Bellwethers are often used in product-liability litigation when many people have similar claims. In this instance, such cases could help G.M. and lawyers for the plaintiffs try out legal strategies or help them determine whether to settle. Of the six bellwethers, three were picked by lawyers for the plaintiffs and three by the defense. The first case, being heard in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is one chosen by the plaintiffs\u2019 side. It involves Robert Scheuer, an Oklahoman who was injured when his 2003 Saturn Ion crashed into a tree on May 28, 2014. Mr. Scheuer, 49, has claimed that the defective ignition switch in his car caused the airbags not to deploy during his accident, leading to neck and back injuries. In February 2014, G.M. began recalling what eventually numbered 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts, Ions and other small cars for a defect in the ignition switch. If jostled, the switch could unexpectedly shut off, cutting power to the engine and disabling airbags, power steering and power brakes. At least 124 deaths have been acknowledged by G.M., through its compensation program, to be tied to the defect."]
["business", "Bob Hilliard, a lawyer for Mr. Scheuer, said in his opening statement that his client had received a recall notice for his Ion in early May 2014 and had called his dealership, which had informed him that there were not enough replacement parts and to call back in a month. Mr. Scheuer then followed G.M.\u2019s instructions to remove his key from his key chain, Mr. Hilliard said, to prevent the extra weight from accidentally turning the key. Later that month, on a sunny and dry day, he drove off the road. Photos in the courtroom on Tuesday showed his white car wrecked against a tree. His airbag did not deploy. Mr. Hilliard walked the jury of five men and seven women through the history of the defect, from 2001 when G.M. first began to learn about the problem, to the first recalls in early 2014. He said that G.M. had engaged in a cover-up. He emphasized that the automaker had rejected an inexpensive repair for the defect that could have saved lives. \u201cThis case is not just about an accident that occurred in 2014 in Oklahoma,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the conduct of the company for a period of time that spans more than a decade.\u201d Mike Brock, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, who is defending G.M., said in his opening statement that the company \u201cdoes not come to court today to tell you that we were perfect.\u201d He emphasized that the company had terminated 15 employees in the wake of its ignition recall and had created a program to compensate some victims of crashes and their families, in exchange for their not suing the company."]
["business", "But Mr. Brock said G.M. had committed no fraud against Mr. Scheuer and would show that Mr. Scheuer\u2019s injuries were not linked to a defective ignition. In the opening statement, Mr. Brock argued that Mr. Scheuer, a postal worker, had a long history of back pain that preceded the accident, stemming from an industrial accident in 1988. He also showed a hospital discharge report from the day after the accident that said: \u201cNo obvious injuries from his motor vehicle collision\u201d and \u201chistory of chronic pain management.\u201d Mr. Brock also argued that testing by G.M. showed that Mr. Scheuer\u2019s key could not have accidentally turned if he had, as he said, taken it off the key chain. He said that Mr. Scheuer had claimed that he did not lose his power steering or power brakes while going off the road. He added that under the circumstances of the accident, Mr. Scheuer\u2019s airbag should not have deployed. Both sides agreed that Mr. Scheuer\u2019s car was airborne \u2014 after going off the road, but before hitting two trees \u2014 for about 28 feet with a vertical drop of about three and a half feet. Mr. Scheuer\u2019s lawyer argued that his client\u2019s airbag should have deployed upon landing, before the car hit the trees. G.M.\u2019s lawyer argued that although the car continued to travel forward while airborne, the vertical drop should not have caused the airbags to deploy. The car had slowed substantially by the time it hit the trees \u2014 though it did knock one over."]
["business", "\u201cYou do not want your airbags to deploy on every little bump and grind that a car goes through,\u201d Mr. Brock said. Chris Caruso, an airbag expert for the plaintiffs, said during his testimony on Tuesday that when the car landed, the undercarriage would have gone right into the ground and the airbags \u201cshould have fired right there.\u201d Mr. Brock questioned Mr. Scheuer\u2019s timeline of the events and suggested that, because of the trajectory of the car, Mr. Scheuer might have fallen asleep and drifted off the road, contradicting Mr. Scheuer\u2019s story that he had been run off the road."]

On the other hand, I admired the balance and complexity of the Wake and Bake, a mutant rye manhattan made with coffee- and orange-flavored vermouth. What I can\u2019t imagine ever loving is being asked by a server to stick my head inside the inflated plastic bag in which it is served, to see that it really did smell like an everything bagel. It did, but it was one of several moments when I felt like a parent helping the Aviary staff to complete a project for the science fair."]
["dining", "After a round or two, the alert drinker may become gun-shy. A friend I\u2019d invited for lunch gamely sipped a Boom Goes the Dynamite, which had never cooled below tepid despite having fumed vigorously from the dry ice inside its laboratory flask. Leaving a third undrunk, she asked for a Bloody Mary. \u201cOur Bloody Mary is very unique,\u201d our server said brightly. \u201cIt takes about 15, 20 minutes to make.\u201d \u201cIs it served ... cold?\u201d my friend asked, hope flickering weakly in her voice. It was. A few minutes later, a relatively traditional Bloody was poured over many tiny ice marbles inside the bowl of what looked like a small spittoon. Around the spittoon\u2019s broad brim were arranged five garnishes, or side dishes, or condiments, including chopped razor clam with celery sorbet and a little pillbox of horseradish jelly. When we were alone again, she sighed and said, \u201cI was hoping for a glass.\u201d The Aviary\u2019s Bloody Mary, by the way, costs $38. We had come to try the daytime menu the Aviary recently introduced after two months or so of nighttime-only business. While the drinks gave us a bumpy ride, all was smooth once we embarked on the three-course, $45 lunch, starting with a roasted squash soup and a salad. Both had pieces of fruit and vegetable that had somehow been talked into tasting like more than they were. Finally there was a sandwich of fried, buttermilk- and yuzu-brined chicken thigh with pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce on a bun with more sesame seeds to the square inch than I\u2019ve ever seen. The dressing was a toasted sesame sauce, and, like everything else about the sandwich, it was excellent."]
["dining", "Apart from a fried pork rind the size of a dish towel, the items on the evening menu are generally wispy: a single, wonderful tempura shrimp with slices of yuzu-scented pear; an octopus croquette under streamers of bonito. There is one of Mr. Achatz\u2019s earliest inventions, the raviolo filled to the bursting point with black-truffle broth. It is still a marvel. There was only one dish I did not like, but boy, did I not like it: cold pork belly in a bland goo of banana curry, sandwiched between flat discs of iceberg lettuce. These plates run from $11 to $29. Two or three would make for an interesting postcard from the inside of Mr. Achatz\u2019s head. Ordering the whole roster would leave you a couple hundred dollars poorer and no wiser, though. The menu is not designed for that kind of eating. Neither is the Aviary, although it\u2019s hard to say just what it is designed for. Deals between chefs and hotels invariably entail compromise, but Mr. Achatz and Mr. Kokonas may have given up too much here. Sunk a few steps below the hotel lobby and dominated by a view of the Central Park skyline, the space is an awkward combination of destination and waiting room. Achatz devotees who paid for their spots weeks earlier through Mr. Kokonas\u2019s reservations and guest-tracking service, Tock, may find themselves at curved leather lounge chairs next to hotel guests taking phone calls between meetings."]

You do get that sense when you enter the Office. The Chicago Office is downstairs from the Aviary; in New York it is behind a wooden door just past the Aviary\u2019s cocktail-assembly station. Suddenly faceless hotel luxury gives way to a den of leather club chairs, parquet floors, clothbound books, manual typewriters, contemporary art, eccentric antiques. The two Offices are usually called speakeasies. This one looks to me more like the library of stately Wayne Manor. The theme is tradition. This being an Achatz project, the theme is pushed to its limits and beyond. Micah Melton, the beverage director of both lounges (in both cities), scours auctions and private sales for old bottles of spirits. Some of the older ones go here for $500 an ounce or more, straight up. Others are mixed into what the menu calls \u201cdusty bottle cocktails.\u201d As a way to get rid of money, this is both alluring and appalling. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to order a $475 old-fashioned stirred from bourbon bottled in 1969. But I couldn\u2019t resist learning what happens when 75 grams of shaved truffle soak in a bottle of Chartreuse. (It\u2019s fascinating, but not more delicious than untruffled Chartreuse.) The short food menu appears to have been printed by letterpress. On it are a number of time-honored plutocratic pleasures, such as cold oysters, foie gras terrine, and a really fine and forcefully seasoned tartare of ivory-veined rib-eye."]

The contortions that Mr. Melton and Mr. Achatz put liquor through at the Aviary are as imaginative as cuisine gets; they probably have more freedom than they would if the place were a restaurant. But rather than asking how a Bloody Mary, say, can be improved, or what its essence is, they seem to ask: How would the Aviary serve it? The answer always seems to require equipment. The bird-all-the-way-out drinks especially are like elaborate magic tricks with metal boxes into which the beautiful assistant will vanish. Somehow, the boxes upstage the assistant.

Walters, who is on trial in Manhattan on insider trading charges, attacked the credibility of one of the government\u2019s main witnesses on Thursday, saying that the witness had lied repeatedly to investigators. The prosecution witness, Thomas C. Davis, the former chairman of Dean Foods in Dallas, testified earlier this week that he had given Mr. Walters \u201cenormous\u201d amounts of insider information to use in stock trades, while using the code \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d to refer to the company and sometimes speaking on a prepaid cellphone called the Bat Phone. On Thursday, Barry H.

The defense lawyer also suggested that Mr. Davis had misled investigators about his sports gambling habits, the patronage of prostitutes and even about the existence of what Mr. Berke referred to as \u201cthe so-called Bat Phone.\u201d The insider trading case is the most significant in New York since that of Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs board member who gave confidential information to the billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam."]
["business/dealbook", "The government has said that Mr. Walters realized profits and avoided losses of more than $40 million from about 2008 through 2014 from inside information he received on Dean Foods. During the cross-examination, which began late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Berke described an episode in 2015 in which Mr. Davis drove a former wife, Louise, to a cemetery, and after asking if she was wearing a wire, requested that she not talk with federal agents. Mr. Berke asked whether Mr. Davis had told her: \u201cI don\u2019t think they want me. I think they want me to roll over on Billy Walters.\u201d \u201cThat is totally not accurate,\u201d Mr. Davis responded. Mr. Davis acknowledged on the stand that he had taken $100,000 for his own use from a charity he ran to benefit a women\u2019s shelter. He also acknowledged that he had listed a $5,900 surprise birthday dinner for his third wife, Terie, as an expense connected to the charity and falsely claimed that the mayor of Dallas, Mike Rawlings, had given an address at the dinner. And he agreed that he had arranged for Terie Davis to be falsely presented as an employee of a company run by a friend so she could receive insurance, and had then reimbursed that company for payments to her. But Mr. Davis took issue with Mr. Berke\u2019s description of that as fraud as well as the lawyer\u2019s contention that Mr. Davis might have violated his cooperation agreement by not informing prosecutors of the insurance effort. \u201cI\u2019m not going to admit to defrauding anything here,\u201d Mr. Davis said."]

During this weird Oval Office summit, Elvis Presley (the beloved) trash-talked the Beatles as un-American and Richard M. Nixon (the other guy) handed out souvenirs to the King\u2019s courtiers. Nixon didn\u2019t write about this encounter in his memoirs, but a photograph of him smiling while shaking hands with Presley is the most requested item from the National Archives \u2014 a bigger hit than even the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. It was an improbable meeting of suspicious minds, instigated by Presley\u2019s desire to be a \u201cfederal agent at large,\u201d which would give him a badge that, Priscilla Presley later wrote, he thought would allow him to travel freely with guns and drugs. Presley personally delivered his request, handwritten on American Airlines stationery, to the White House, and a presidential aide pitched the get-together to the chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman: \u201cIf the president wants to meet with some bright young people outside of the government, Presley might be a perfect one to start with.\u201d Mr. Haldeman was dubious. \u201cYou must be kidding,\u201d he scribbled on the letter, though he did sign off on the visit."]
["movies", "The meeting ran as long as 30 minutes if the presidential diaries are to be trusted. Not much happened. Presley gave Nixon a commemorative World War II Colt .45 mounted in a display case, and Nixon admired Presley\u2019s cuff links. Presley also hugged Nixon. In his notes on the appointment, a White House assistant deputy, Egil Krogh, wrote that Presley, in a \u201cvery emotional manner,\u201d told Nixon that he was on the president\u2019s side, wanted to be helpful and restore some respect for the flag \u201cwhich was being lost.\u201d Presley, Mr. Krogh wrote, also said that he was \u201cjust a poor boy from Tennessee who had gotten a lot from his country, which in some way he wanted to repay.\u201d Directed by Liza Johnson, \u201cElvis & Nixon,\u201d a fictionalized take on the face-to-face, doesn\u2019t add much to this rundown; mostly it adds groovy threads and the improbably cast Michael Shannon as Elvis. A character actor who has powered into star roles partly through his ominous charisma, Mr. Shannon makes no physical sense as Elvis Presley, even when wearing the familiar royal armor \u2014 the rings flashing like gold-plated brass knuckles, the sculptured hair, the cute revolver strapped to a pale ankle.

As Elvis, Mr. Shannon doesn\u2019t deliver a performance that\u2019s a triumph of technical virtuosity along the lines of Meryl Streep\u2019s eerie reanimation of Julia Child in \u201cJulie & Julia\u201d; it isn\u2019t even a halfway decent Elvis impersonation. It is instead a performance of stardom by an actor whose own magnetism trumps every objection, much as the real Presley transcends every jibe, jumpsuit and downward turn.

It\u2019s also too short and straight. Instead of extending the conclave, turning each Elvis-Nixon minute into a time-expanded mind-bender, the filmmakers make it another act.

The university has been experiencing a small and slow-moving outbreak of a type of bacterial meningitis known as strain B. Four students and a visitor to the campus developed symptoms between March 22 and June 29; all have recovered. Two other students developed symptoms in October and early November. One has recovered; the other is recovering. On Friday, another student was diagnosed with meningitis, and tests are underway to determine whether it was caused by strain B. Last year, some 160 cases of strain B were reported in the United States. The disease can cause headaches, high fevers and stiff necks, and it is fatal in 10 percent to 15 percent of the cases. The vaccine currently used to prevent bacterial meningitis in this country protects against several other strains but not against strain B. A vaccine that has proved to be effective against strain B is Bexsero, made by Novartis, which is based in Switzerland and which won regulatory approval for the vaccine in Europe in January and in Australia in August. The company has not pushed for approval here because it is concentrating on a vaccine against the other strains."]

Pineda was ejected from his last start, an April 23 game against the Boston Red Sox, after pine tar was discovered on his neck. Then, while he was serving a 10-game suspension for the violation, Pineda strained a muscle in his upper back, near his right shoulder, extending his absence from the team. Pineda, 25, was originally scheduled to make one more rehabilitation start, but on Sunday the Yankees determined he was strong enough to make his return this week and summoned him to join his teammates for an important three-game series against the Baltimore Orioles. \u201cIf he felt he needed another one, or we felt he needed another one, that was built in,\u201d Manager Joe Girardi said Monday of Pineda\u2019s rehabilitation plan. \u201cBut we feel he\u2019s ready.\u201d If Pineda can re-establish the form he showed before his suspension and injury, his return will be a major boost to the team. Pineda had a 2-2 record and a 1.83 earned run average in four starts before the suspension and injury. In another bit of positive news for the Yankees, the right-hander Masahiro Tanaka continued his modest throwing program as he and the team continued to test whether he could return this season after a partial tear was found in the ulnar collateral ligament of his pitching elbow last month.

They began the day trailing the Orioles by six games in the American League East. \u201cThere\u2019s still a ton of baseball that has to be played,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cI find it always interesting how the feeling about a club can change from one day to the next, or one week to the next, or a couple weeks.

But at 7 p.m., they shed their white coats and headed to an auditorium nestled in the back of a Columbia University Medical Center building, adjacent to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.

The arts and humanities initiative at Harvard Medical School includes a collaboration with American Repertory Theater. Yale School of Medicine requires a course in which students observe paintings.

A judge in Monroe County \u2014 the section of Alabama where Ms. Lee was raised, and where she died last month at the age of 89 \u2014 agreed to seal the will in a decision made on Monday and released on Friday by the probate court.

Also of keen interest is how her assets are to be distributed. Ms. Lee never married and had no children. Her closest living relatives are nieces and nephews. After the death of her sister Alice in 2014, she had increasingly relied on the counsel and companionship of her lawyer, Tonja Carter, who was the trustee of her estate and the person who said she discovered the manuscript for \u201cWatchman\u201d in a bank safe deposit box."]

In her view, women are also sabotaging themselves. \u201cWe hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in,\u201d she writes, and the result is that \u201cmen still run the world.\u201d Ms. Sandberg wants to take women through a collective self-awareness exercise.

It is architecturally generic, like countless other homes scattered across this part of Michigan, and yet it also happens to be a work of art, the last major piece by the artist Mike Kelley. \u201cMobile Homestead\u201d \u2014 a to-scale recreation of the house where Kelley grew up in Westland, a suburb 30 minutes from Detroit \u2014 is open to the public, a community exhibition space managed by the museum. Scarcely seen, though, is what sits far below it: an intricate underground lair often referred to, in a remarkable understatement, as \u201cthe basement.\u201d Kelley planned on using it himself as a project space before committing suicide in 2012. His admirers still speak of his passing with great regret. \u201cWhat a huge presence he created, seemingly out of a sense of inadequacy,\u201d his friend the musician Kim Gordon told me. The artist was a self-described \u201cblue-collar anarchist,\u201d and cited Iggy Pop and Sun Ra among his primary influences. His impact has been widespread and profound and perhaps unexpected. Kelley\u2019s subjects were marginalized figures \u2014 janitors, comic book characters, lonely teenagers. His work rested somewhere between conceptual art, pop culture and the foggy memories of his own working-class upbringing; he was attracted, he once said, to \u201cplaces that the majority of men would close off as degraded and disgusting.\u201d"]
["t-magazine/art", "In many ways, \u201cMobile Homestead\u201d was the culmination of his singular career. From conception, Kelley thought of it as a project having two parts, public and private, with the basement accessible only to his friends and other artists. The idea was to create a piece that would be simultaneously geared toward community service and also, in part, closed off to the community. The completed \u201cMobile Homestead\u201d opened in 2013. In keeping with Kelley\u2019s intention, it quickly became an unofficial town hall, hosting everything from book drives to A.A. meetings to quilting workshops to a lawyer offering a lecture on obtaining house loans. During the 2016 presidential election \u2014 with a show mounted on the walls of the house featuring political memorabilia from local collector Morry \u201cThe Button Man\u201d Greener \u2014 the debates were screened in the garage, and people got into arguments in the driveway. Meanwhile, the basement below the house functioned according to Kelley\u2019s plans as a space reserved only for, in the artist\u2019s words, \u201cprivate rites of an aesthetic nature,\u201d an antisocial space within the public work."]
["t-magazine/art", "Kelley\u2019s old friend Cary Loren is the de facto caretaker of the house\u2019s subterranean lair \u2014 \u201cthe basement curator,\u201d in the words of Elysia Borowy-Reeder, MOCAD\u2019s executive director. I met Loren one afternoon in February at the bookstore he co-owns, inside a strip mall in the suburb of Oak Park. Loren and Kelley founded the influential noise band Destroy All Monsters with the artist Jim Shaw and the singer Niagara in 1973, while they were all studying at the University of Michigan. (At the time Shaw and Kelley were living together in a house in Ann Arbor called God\u2019s Oasis; Kelley\u2019s room, where the band also practiced, was, somewhat predictably, in the basement.) Since his friend\u2019s death, Loren has helped to oversee \u201cMobile Homestead,\u201d offering suggestions for exhibitions in the house and handpicking the few artists who have been allowed to work, in secret, underground. Calling the space a basement is a bit of a misnomer. It is more of a complex maze of tunnels, ladders and cubbylike rooms, a sort of habitable sculpture. Loren and Kelley began talking about purchasing property for an artist\u2019s refuge back in the \u201990s. By this time, Kelley \u2014 who left Detroit in 1976 to attend CalArts in Valencia \u2014 was considered the quintessential West Coast artist, but he remained devoted to Michigan. \u201cMike had this idea of buying his childhood home,\u201d Loren said, and turning it into a band house, with tunnels beneath, \u201cburrowing,\u201d as Kelley described it in 2010, \u201cinto other people\u2019s private space.\u201d This was an unfeasible concept that the artist pursued anyway. Whenever he visited Michigan, Loren said, \u201cwe\u2019d stop by his house and he\u2019d go up there with a checkbook and try to buy it from the owner, who never wanted to sell.\u201d"]
["t-magazine/art", "KELLEY WAS BORN IN 1954 into a Catholic working-class family. The artist John Miller, a classmate at CalArts who has written extensively about Kelley, traces Kelley\u2019s interest in secret chambers back to his father, who worked as a public school janitor. Kelley once described how the job granted him access to \u201chidden underbellies,\u201d like the boiler rooms and maintenance closets of banal public buildings. He would revisit the tension between the visible and the unseen, the conscious and the unconscious, in much of his work. The strongest precedent for \u201cMobile Homestead\u201d was his 1995 architectural model \u201cEducational Complex,\u201d a tabletop representation of Kelley\u2019s childhood home along with every school he attended. Kelley claimed, perhaps deceptively, that the majority were blocked from his memory because, as he put it, \u201c80 percent of these buildings that I had been in for most of my life were the site of some kind of repressed trauma.\u201d The failure to remember was Kelley\u2019s modus operandi, a method apparent in his final work\u2019s stark and nondescript interior. As an installation, \u201cMobile Homestead\u201d ties together the various strains of Kelley\u2019s career, including his obsession with isolation and loneliness, and with domesticity and familiar structures (including the repressed darkness lurking beneath every happy home). The only thing most people know of the space, since no photo of it has been publicly released, is that it is reached through one of two hatches, one inside the house, the other out front. That the basement is essentially invisible only adds to its power, casting the entire project as a series of unanswerable questions: If an artist creates an intricate underground studio beneath a replica of his childhood home and virtually no one is able to see it, does it exist? Who is it for? What is it for?"]
["t-magazine/art", "In 2005, the London-based nonprofit Artangel, which funded \u201cMobile Homestead,\u201d approached Kelley about doing a public art project. As the years went by, Kelley was doubtful the project would ever be completed, according to various people who helped with it; there were too many moving parts. And yet he worked away at it up until his suicide. Despite the heavy personal subtext of the project, Kelley didn\u2019t want it to become a tribute to himself, and he asked that his own work not be shown inside. UPON THE BASEMENT\u2019S completion after Kelley\u2019s death, the first thing Loren did was to cover a wall with Destroy All Monsters artwork. That was followed by a sort of \u201cchristening\u201d by Loren and Shaw, who recorded some music in the space, including a demented cover of Andy Williams\u2019s \u201cLonely Street.\u201d Since then, Loren has mostly invited Kelley\u2019s friends underground, including the artist Paul McCarthy and the band he plays with, Extended Organ, which performed in one of the rooms. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s inviting,\u201d McCarthy said of the space. \u201cI like it, but it\u2019s not cozy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be cozy.\u201d McCarthy was as surprised as anyone by the existence of the basement: \u201cI never knew he was doing it until literally the day of his memorial, and he\u2019s already gone.\u201d"]
["t-magazine/art", "MOCAD and the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts have a strict policy about maintaining the privacy of the basement, in keeping with Kelley\u2019s wishes that \u201cthe underground zone will not be open to the public and the works produced there would have to be presented elsewhere, or not at all.\u201d One cannot simply walk into MOCAD and ask to see it. Perhaps one wouldn\u2019t want to. Amy Corle, the curator at the museum who runs the programming for \u201cMobile Homestead,\u201d had told me that fear is not an uncommon reaction to standing over the hatch that is in what would have been Kelley\u2019s childhood bedroom closet. \u201cA lot of people think they want to go down,\u201d she said, \u201cand then they look and say, \u2018No.\u2019\u2009\u201d This reaction is understandable. A clunky and awkwardly placed ladder leads to a concrete room with another ladder leading farther downward. There is a path at the bottom with more ladders that go up into tunnels that connect to different rooms. Some of these chambers have extremely low ceilings that an adult of average height could not stand up in. Light comes from small fluorescent bulbs in caged fixtures, the kind found in a submarine. One of the tunnels leads to the space where Paul McCarthy played with Extended Organ. It is covered in cheap Halloween decorations. In another room, Loren installed a God\u2019s Oasis sign. Elsewhere, he stored some of Kelley\u2019s ashes."]
["t-magazine/art", "The space is both claustrophobic and improbably vast, and panic can set in quickly. Standing there, staring into the dark of one of Kelley\u2019s concrete tunnels, about 40 feet beneath the ground, with only blackness visible ahead, it helps to think of home."]
["sports/baseball", "For Matt Harvey, Physical Plight of Jeremy Hefner Carries a Cautionary Tale - The New York Times They went down with elbow injuries within 15 days of each other last August, Matt Harvey and Jeremy Hefner, two young Mets pitchers with vastly different backgrounds who found themselves staring at the same long road to recovery. Hefner was first. He felt the pinch of an elbow injury after a start on Aug. 9, 2013, in the middle of a stretch in which he had won four of seven games. But news of his subsequent Tommy John surgery went largely unnoticed. That\u2019s because, on Aug. 24, Harvey complained of forearm soreness after a start against Detroit, and the Mets\u2019 world went spinning. From the outset, there was always something hopeful for Harvey to glean from Hefner, who had his surgery late last August, about two months before Harvey\u2019s own Tommy John procedure in October. Far less heralded, Hefner quietly went about his business repairing his arm, away from the bright spotlight that Harvey commanded. Hefner, too, stated his intention to pitch in 2014. In fact, he was nearing that point. But during his sixth rehabilitation start for Class A Port St. Lucie on Wednesday, Hefner experienced a drastic setback, reinjuring his ulnar collateral ligament, which may mean yet another reconstructive elbow surgery. And the Mets could only shudder to think, \u201cWhat if this were Harvey?\u201d \u201cHis is a cautionary story for others,\u201d General Manager Sandy Alderson said of Hefner, \u201cincluding Matt Harvey.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "The dynamic between the cautious Mets front office and the precocious 25-year-old ace Harvey has been a complex subplot throughout his monthslong recovery. Harvey has been forthright in his determination to pitch for the Mets in 2014. Mets management has been equally steadfast in restraining his enthusiasm. Harvey is, after all, the team\u2019s most precious commodity, and each proclamation about his impending return was echoed by Alderson\u2019s measured refrain, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d On Tuesday, Alderson put a much bolder strike through Harvey\u2019s expectations of pitching at some point in the 2014 season and even suggested that he might not even pitch in any other setting until spring training of next year. Some of Alderson\u2019s more defined stance seemed to come from the impact of Hefner\u2019s setback. Alderson added that there was no indication that Hefner had done anything wrong with his rehab, or that Harvey should change his method of recovery. \u201cWho knows if anyone is doing everything right?\u201d Alderson said. \u201cThere\u2019s so little direction on these things, other than the passage of time and laying off.\u201d Hefner\u2019s recovery effort was not even especially aggressive, Alderson said. A 28-year-old right-hander, Hefner was approaching the first anniversary of his surgery, which is a standard benchmark for returning. When he progressed from bullpens and throwing live batting practices to pitching in actual games, however, something snapped. \u201cOur doctors have told us this is a pretty rare occurrence,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cBut, obviously, this can happen.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "Harvey had yet to throw a bullpen session; he just recently started tossing from the mound.

There are scares seemingly around every corner these days for the Mets. They placed the promising rookie Jacob deGrom on the 15-day disabled list on Sunday with shoulder tendinitis, although Alderson felt confident deGrom would not require a longer stay than the minimum allotment. Before Tuesday\u2019s game, deGrom said he was relieved by a doctor\u2019s report after receiving a magnetic resonance imaging examination. \u201cI felt good all year, and then that happened,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything was serious.

The proposed rules would also require Internet service providers to disclose whether in assigning faster lanes, they have favored their affiliated companies that provide content. That could have significant implications for Comcast, the nation\u2019s largest provider of high-speed Internet service, because it owns NBCUniversal. Also, Comcast is asking for government permission to take over Time Warner Cable, the third-largest broadband provider, and opponents of the merger say that expanding its reach as a broadband company will give Comcast more incentive to favor its own content over that of unaffiliated programmers. Mr. Wheeler has signaled for months that the federal appeals court decision striking down the earlier rules could force the commission to loosen its definitions of what constitutes an open Internet. Those earlier rules effectively barred Internet service providers from making deals with services like Amazon or Netflix to allow those companies to pay to stream their products to viewers through a faster, express lane on the web. The court said that because the Internet is not considered a utility under federal law, it was not subject to that sort of regulation.

It was a tragedy, yet it did not feel like an accident. All those people were there, lined up in the cold and darkness, because of sophisticated marketing forces that have produced this day now called Black Friday.

After 9/11, President Bush dispatched Americans to the malls as a patriotic act. When the economy faltered early this year, the government gave out tax rebate checks and told people to spend. In a sense, those Chinese-made flat-screen televisions sitting inside Wal-Mart have become American comfort food. And yet the ability to spend is constricting rapidly. Credit card limits are getting cut. Millions of Americans now owe the bank more than the value of their homes, making further borrowing impossible. The banks themselves are hunkered down, just hoping to survive.

The evening blast, which set apartment buildings ablaze and scattered bodies in the street, was the deadliest bombing in Lebanon in more than eight years and raised fears that the country was slipping into a new era of political violence. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, declared Friday a national day of mourning. There were no credible claims of responsibility, but many here saw the bombing \u2014 and a similar attack nearby last month \u2014 as spillover from the civil war in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah has become increasingly involved there, sending fighters to back President Bashar al-Assad against the predominantly Sunni rebels seeking his overthrow. That involvement has enraged Sunnis in both countries, and many said they suspected that extremists among them had used the blasts to strike back. \u201cIt was clear that this was an attack on Hezbollah,\u201d said Moussa Ghamloush, 54, who was standing outside his restaurant, around the corner from the blast site. He had been in the kitchen when the explosion \u201cshook the earth\u201d and sent glass flying. \u201cThis is all because of the fighting in Syria,\u201d Mr. Ghamloush said, accusing Al Qaeda and an extremist Syrian group linked to it, the Nusra Front."]

Witnesses reported seeing bodies in the street afterward, one hanging from some scaffolding down the block. Fires raged inside the buildings, and smoke poured from their blown-out windows. Fire trucks packed the streets, as men from the neighborhood, some wielding automatic rifles, tried to clear the streets to allow water trucks to enter and ambulances to leave with the dead and wounded. The fires and damage to the buildings made it hard for rescue crews to evacuate residents. Hours after the blast, men wearing face masks to block the smoke were still searching the upper floors with flashlights, taking residents to windows to be lowered to the street in the fire trucks\u2019 elevator towers. Hezbollah\u2019s control of the area, where most residents are Shiites, is clear. Large posters of the group\u2019s \u201cmartyrs\u201d adorn lampposts, and after the blast, men belonging to the movement, carrying guns and walkie-talkies, blocked the main highway exit leading to the site and many roads nearby. When asked whom they blamed for the blast, many residents listed the group\u2019s enemies: Israel, against which it has fought numerous wars; Al Qaeda, which considers Shiites heretics; Syria\u2019s rebels, which resent the group\u2019s support for Mr. Assad; and the Persian Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which support the Syrian uprising."]

A Sunni resident who asked that his name not be published out of fear of Hezbollah said that after the July attack, Hezbollah members checked every outsider who entered the area and passed out business cards with phone numbers that residents could call to report strangers.

But she argued that he had been led on the path to violence by his older, \u201cself-radicalized\u201d brother, Tamerlan, who she said planned the attacks and bought the pressure cookers and explosives used to make the bombs. While prosecutors asserted that the younger Mr. Tsarnaev was a committed terrorist intent on avenging American military campaigns in the Muslim world, Ms. Clarke depicted him as a loyal younger brother and fairly typical teenager, interested in girls and cars, who fell under the sway of his domineering sibling. Just which portrait of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the jury buys will help determine whether he gets life \u2014 or death. Since the bombings on April 15, 2013, law enforcement officials, journalists and the Tsarnaevs\u2019 neighbors and friends have been engaged in a similar effort to construct a narrative that might explain the calamitous trajectory of the brothers\u2019 lives. How do the dots connect in the lives of Tamerlan, the big kid his mother compared to Hercules, who once dreamed of representing the United States on the Olympics boxing team, and Dzhokhar, the star high school student, described by many friends as a sweet, \u201csuperchill\u201d pothead who had seemingly adapted to American life with fluency and ease."]

Putin and his rise to power (\u201cThe Man Without a Face\u201d), and a critically acclaimed book about Pussy Riot (\u201cWords Will Break Cement\u201d). Her own background would seem to make her an ideal author for this story: an immigrant, she was a Russian-speaking teenager when she moved with her parents to the Boston area, and she later returned to Russia to report on the transformative changes rocking the former Soviet Union and on the wars in Chechnya in the 1990s. As it turns out, her knowledge of Soviet and Russian history, and her reporting on the ground in Dagestan, Kyrgyzstan and Chechnya, lend a resonance and weight to the sections of this book devoted to the Tsarnaev family\u2019s peregrinations in that region before deciding to immigrate to the United States. (Dzhokhar arrived in Cambridge, Mass., with his parents in 2002, when he was 8; his brother the next year.) Ms. Gessen explains how the history of Chechnya \u2014 and the radicalism that took root there \u2014 might have affected family members, and she also brings an understanding of the dislocations often faced by immigrants to her account of the family\u2019s struggles to make new lives for themselves in Cambridge."]

At the same time, there are few new details about the brothers\u2019 lives in America that haven\u2019t already appeared in newspapers, magazines or on the web, and the book sheds little fresh light on Dzhokhar\u2019s relationship with his brother, which is so central to his trial. Though Ms. Gessen takes issue with some of the assumptions and conclusions reached by other journalists, \u201cThe Brothers\u201d remains highly indebted to earlier reports, most notably two long articles \u2014 \u201cThe Fall of the House of Tsarnaev,\u201d in The Boston Globe in December 2013 (based on months of reporting by that paper\u2019s staff), and \u201cJahar\u2019s World,\u201d a July 2013 article in Rolling Stone (which came under fire for its cover, featuring a photo of the younger Tsarnaev, which critics contended glamorized him as a celebrity). The portrait of the Tsarnaevs that emerges from this book, like many accounts, is that of a restless, fractious family that would find its immigrant dreams dissolving, after a decade, into disappointment and dysfunction; a family whose personal woes and confusions seem to have played as large a role, or even a larger one, in paving the brothers\u2019 road to violence than any sort of coherent, informed ideology or religious commitment."]

His social circle had become more insular (it included two students from Kazakhstan, who would be prosecuted for their roles in removing a backpack and a laptop from Mr. Tsarnaev\u2019s room after they realized he was a suspect in the bombings), and Ms. Gessen writes that he had begun a process of \u201cre-Russifying himself.\u201d But, while she notes that he was spending \u201can increasing amount of time on Russian-language social networks,\u201d she provides little useful new analysis of his online life and sheds equally little light on his evolving relationship with his brother, Tamerlan, who seems to have been radicalized (or at least found a new sense of identity) after spending six months in Dagestan in 2012.

Cautions on Concentrated Positions in U.S. Mutual Funds - The New York Times The International Monetary Fund  warned on Tuesday of the large positions that mutual funds in the United States have built in high-yielding bonds issued by risky companies in America and in emerging markets around the world. The warning comes at a time of increased nervousness about China and other emerging markets like Brazil. And it highlights a growing concern on the part of regulators and economists that mutual funds, in their hunger to load up on high-risk, high-yield securities in an environment of low interest rates, will be hard pressed to sell them during a market reversal. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates fund companies, proposed a series of rules and regulations intended to bolster the practices of mutual and exchange-traded funds when it comes to returning cash to investors. The reports were part of a broader research overview that the I.M.F. was presenting ahead of its fall meetings, which are to be held in Lima, Peru, starting next week. In particular, the I.M.F. said that the bountiful amounts of cash that have moved around the marketplace in this era of extraordinary central bank activism had given many investors a false sense of security in terms of their ability to sell assets on demand. \u201cEven seemingly plentiful market liquidity can suddenly evaporate and lead to systemic financial disruptions,\u201d the authors of the report concluded."]

Most large investment banks no longer actively trade these securities, increasing the danger that a contagious bout of selling could spread through the financial marketplace, the fund\u2019s economists noted. Although the language of the fund\u2019s experts was muted, their words of caution highlight increased investor unease about the slowdown in China and other large emerging markets. Skittish investors in the United States and around the world have to date pulled close to $75 billion from global bond and equity funds that invest in emerging markets this year, according to the data provider EPFR, with institutions that focus on global bonds such as Franklin Templeton and Pimco suffering the most acute outflows. Underpinning the I.M.F.\u2019s worries has been the tremendous increase in bonds issued by a range of large emerging market corporations, including energy firms in Latin America and steel companies in Southeast Asia. Two countries that have been at the center of investor concerns \u2014 China and Turkey \u2014 were highlighted in the fund\u2019s study on emerging-market debts.

Mutual funds in the United States have been the most aggressive buyers of these securities, and the fear is that, as these economies slow and their currencies tumble, the companies will default and it will be the American mutual fund investor who will be left with the bill. Although the I.M.F. and other international watchdogs such as the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for global central banks, have been highlighting this concern for some time, there has been little evidence to date of mutual funds being unable to sell their bonds when asked to do so by investors. And mutual fund companies have vigorously defended their policies in terms of providing liquidity to investors.

Lack of candor, or knowingly providing false information, is a fireable offense at the F.B.I. The inspector general said that when investigators asked whether Mr. McCabe had instructed a pair of aides to provide information in October 2016 to Devlin Barrett, then a Wall Street Journal reporter, Mr. McCabe said he did not authorize the disclosure and did not know who did. Mr. McCabe subsequently said he approved the F.B.I.\u2019s contact with the reporter, according to the review.

It subsides for stretches of time, subdued by the exigencies and entanglements of life, but it stubbornly reasserts itself when a fresh rumor erupts, when another police car shrieks past. Throughout the city, an unrelenting fear persists in the recesses of many people's minds that something else bad is going to happen. A car bomb. A chemical attack. More planes. Will it be today? Tomorrow? In the night? Of course, nothing at all might occur -- many people hope that this is the likely outcome -- but the disquiet persists. Nonetheless, everyone is urged to carry on, do what they do, muster the courage to quell the simmering anxiety. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday again entreated New Yorkers to show how sturdy they are by resuming their lives. It is not easy. For some people, it is impossible. ''Every little thing makes you paranoid,'' said Samia Watt, 31, a manager in a doctor's office from Queens. ''My girlfriends and I went to the movies. When the theater started to shake, I lost it until I realized that it was the subway going by.''"]

Some changes are nuanced and seemingly superfluous; others are more meaningful. Whether changes enacted under such extraordinary strain will endure remains unanswerable, but for now, at least, they are palpable. For those who have made them, they are necessary. Several not normally religious people said they were saying prayers each night before going to bed, a helpful way to ease them into sleep. People who always kept windows open now close them tight. A man, not much of a drinker, said that when he arrives home, his wife has a margarita and he has some bourbon, their new method of calming themselves. Any number of people like these were hesitant to have their names or addresses published. Fear inhibited their openness. ''I guess they wouldn't be targeting individuals, would they?'' one man said. ''I don't know, anything's possible. Why take a chance?'' Some people are keeping their distance. Chris Ciampa, 24, a trader who works in Midtown, planned to move to Manhattan. He's staying put in Queens. There is a person who lives on the Upper East Side and walks to work -- a building on 42nd Street -- passing through the hubbub of Grand Central Terminal as the most expedient route.

Many people, both in New York and elsewhere, have bought things that would never have found their way onto their shopping lists -- gas masks, freeze-dried food, bulletproof vests, ammunition, even parachutes, thinking they may help if they need to escape high floors. Adam Kimowitz, 25, a technology consultant who lives in Kips Bay, bought a gas mask the other day. ''I'd rather know that I made a $50 investment than be sorry,'' he said. He used to live in Israel, where certain precautions were ingrained into him -- eyeing every package and knapsack as a potential harbor for explosives, sizing up everyone he saw in public places to try to gauge if they seemed like the sort who might blow themselves up.

During the night, she wakes up every hour, consults the clock to see if it's morning yet, finds out it isn't, and tries to get another hour of rest until the sequence repeats itself. So much seems purposeless to her. ''My friends say they'll see me at Christmas or we'll go skiing soon,'' she said. ''On the one hand, I react, sure, we'll go skiing. On the other hand, I think, what are they talking about?'' Feeling so helpless, she finds herself drifting into incongruous thought: ''I think, why don't I go to Afghanistan and talk to the people.

The Damantes are insistent on staying in New York, though Mr. Damante's wife is pushing for a second house in the Poconos as a refuge. ''She wants someplace to run to,'' he said. In a city as resolute as New York, many residents insist they feel no fear of what's next, or they are able to hide it, and have changed nothing. Many people left the city for several days after the attacks, in part to settle frayed central nervous systems, in part to wait and see if there was going to be a residual burst of terror. Most, though, have returned, resuming their lives. Not that moving isn't still on some minds.

["t-magazine", "Running Free in Germany\u2019s Outdoor Preschools - The New York Times ONE EARLY MORNING this past February, before the frost melted or the sun fully rose, 20 small children gathered in a scabby municipal park in Pankow, the northernmost borough of Berlin. The sky was gray and the ground was gray, but the children\u2019s cheeks were bright and so were their moods. They ran in circles, shrieked with delight and spent a great deal of time rolling around atop frozen soil as traffic whizzed by just meters away. Their parents, shivering and anxious to get on with the day, paid them little mind. They smiled absent-mindedly and took sips of coffee from environmentally friendly stainless steel to-go cups. Cuckoo! Cuckoo! At the sound of the bird call, mimicked loudly and with eerie accuracy by a man in his early 40s named Picco Peters, the children gathered together and formed a tight circle. A spirited round of songs, sung in both English and German, began and was finished off by a chorus of wolf howls. The circle then dissolved and the group\u2019s 15 older children, ranging in age from 3 to 6, marched past a community garden and toward a busy intersection. (The remaining children, who were younger, stayed in the park.) A woman named Christa Baule led the way, carrying a backpack with a three-foot-long branch sticking dangerously out of it; Peters took up the back."]
["t-magazine", "The children continued to chatter until the public bus came, at which point they wordlessly formed a single-file line and climbed in. Ten minutes later, the bus stopped. Everyone was deposited at the entrance of an 84-acre public park and proceeded to run amok. Robin Hood Waldkindergarten, which opened in 2005, is one of more than 1,500 waldkitas, or \u201cforest kindergartens,\u201d in Germany; Berlin alone has about 20. Most have opened in the last 15 years and are usually located in the city\u2019s parks, with a bare-bones structure serving as a sort of home base, but others, like Robin Hood, rely on public transportation to shuttle their charges daily out into the wilderness, where they spend most of the day, regardless of weather. Toys, typically disparaged at waldkitas, are replaced by the imaginative use of sticks, rocks and leaves. A 2003 Ph.D. dissertation by Peter H\u00e4fner at Heidelberg University showed that graduates of German forest kindergartens had a \u201cclear advantage\u201d over the graduates of regular kindergartens, performing better in cognitive and physical ability, as well as in creativity and social development. The American journalist Richard Louv, who coined the term \u201cnature-deficit disorder\u201d in his 2005 book, \u201cLast Child in the Woods,\u201d is cited often by Robin Hood staff, as is \u201cCoyote\u2019s Guide to Connecting With Nature,\u201d by Jon Young, Ellen Haas and Evan McGown.

They returned and took out small Tupperware containers full of fresh produce from their backpacks. Two girls, both under 5, began arranging the fruit into an elaborate mandala atop a wooden tray. They piled carrot coins in the middle and surrounded them with concentric circles of tangerines, bell pepper slices and cucumber sticks; dates went in one corner and apple chunks in another, with a scattering of walnuts on the opposite side of the plate. Baule had encouraged them to organize the food \u201cneatly\u201d but provided no further instructions. The girls did all this slowly and wordlessly, rearranging items when they didn\u2019t like a particular combination. The end result was as beautiful as anything you\u2019d see in a restaurant. As it is on most mornings, breakfast was eaten in complete quiet. Children took turns silently presenting everyone else with the tray from which they each chose a single piece of fruit until it was all gone. For months, they had been reminded that by not making any noise at all while eating, it is more likely that a deer might approach them, and at the very least they\u2019ll better hear the bird calls. In over 45 minutes I didn\u2019t hear a single giggle. When they were done, Baule excused them. There were sudden laughs and yelps and everyone vanished into the forest."]

Ceramic plates were heaped with salad and polenta, which they devoured with real flatware. One particularly squirmy boy was gently instructed to \u201cplease sit properly\u201d five times.

["us", "As Campus Fears Rise, So Do Efforts to Enact School Gun Laws - The New York Times LOS ANGELES \u2014  When Gov. Jerry Brown of California signed legislation this month banning concealed weapons on school campuses, the nation was in the midst of one of the worst spasms of gun violence at colleges in recent years. There were three such shootings, including one in Oregon that left 10 people dead, as the bill sat on Mr. Brown\u2019s desk. But the new California law went against the grain of what lawmakers in many other states have sought to do. Over the past two years, nearly 15 states have debated legislation to make it easier for teachers, students and administrators to carry concealed weapons on campus. Supporters say the best way to subdue a campus assailant is ensuring that certain people on the scene can mount an armed response before the police arrive. In June, Texas lawmakers made carrying a concealed weapon on campus legal as of August 2016. Similar measures are being debated in Florida, Michigan and Ohio. Last week, Wisconsin Republicans, who control the Legislature, introduced a bill that would ease restrictions on guns on campuses; two days later, Democrats countered with legislation that would ban guns on campus."]
["us", "The issue has resonated on college campuses: At the University of Texas at Austin, students and faculty members have staged a variety of protests about the notion of guns on campus, and a professor announced he would resign, saying he would not feel safe in his classroom. In Florida, the state chapter of Students for Concealed Carry has been awarding free holsters to people who posted their support for that state\u2019s proposed legislation on Facebook. On some campuses, the argument has been made that arming students can help prevent sexual assaults. Backers of the California bill, which passed with overwhelming Democratic support in both houses, predicted that the latest campus shootings would result in a rush across the country to pass measures banning guns in schools. Putting more guns on campus, they said, could confuse the police arriving on the scene about which armed person is the assailant and potentially result in more carnage during a crossfire. \u201cThe sentiment behind this law is our strong belief that law enforcement truly are the ones who need to be in control of arms on the campus,\u201d said State Senator Lois Wolk, the California Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cAnd they are the only ones on campus that should be armed.\u201d But in many places, people express the opposite view. In Oregon, after the shooting at a community college in Roseburg this month, people who live near the campus argued that the death count would have been lower if someone in the classroom had had a gun, and President Obama was jeered when he arrived there to visit victims\u2019 families, something many residents interpreted as part of his push for increased gun control."]
["us", "\u201cAll of these shootings occur in gun-free zones,\u201d said Greg Steube, a Republican member of the Florida House and author of the proposed legislation there allowing guns on campuses. \u201cGun-free zones don\u2019t protect innocent people from a criminal walking onto a campus and shooting people.\u201d Assemblywoman Shannon Grove, a California Republican who says she has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, voted against the bill in her state. \u201cIf you put up signs saying, \u2018No guns allowed on campus,\u2019 that\u2019s not going to stop people who are going to do you harm,\u201d Ms. Grove said in an interview. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a really bad idea to stop qualified individuals from being able to carry their weapons in self-defense or in the defense of others.\u201d The issue remains highly divisive, as has become clear in Texas, the state that most recently passed legislation allowing concealed weapons on campus. The measure is to take effect Aug. 1, the 50th anniversary of the day that an assailant fatally shot 14 people at the University of Texas at Austin, the first massacre on a campus. To protest the law, opponents have swarmed the steps of university buildings, wearing orange shirts that read, \u201cGun Free UT\u201d and \u201cArmed With Reason.\u201d About 750 faculty members signed a petition stating their opposition to guns in their classrooms. One economics professor, Daniel Hamermesh, resigned in protest over the law, saying he would not feel comfortable teaching in a classroom where there might be armed students. Joan Neuberger, a professor of Russian culture, said an increase in guns could lead to accidental injuries, suicides and a culture of fear in classrooms."]
["us", "\u201cIn volatile situations like a mass shooting it\u2019s really, really unlikely that a 21-year-old with a gun is going to have an impact,\u201d Professor Neuberger said. In Florida, where legislators have proposed a gun-friendly bill similar to the one in Texas, a gun rights group called Florida Carry sued Florida State University last month after Rebekah Hargrove, a graduate student there, was barred from having a gun in her car during a school football game. \u201cObviously, the \u2018gun-free zones\u2019 didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Ms. Hargrove, who leads the state\u2019s chapter of Students for Concealed Carry. She said she began supporting the right to carry weapons on campus after a man opened fire in the  library at her school in November 2014, wounding three people. She added: \u201cWe trust our citizens to carry everywhere else. Why wouldn\u2019t we trust them to carry on campus?\u201d Some of the strongest opponents of laws allowing guns on campus have been university officials. The chancellor of the 15-campus University of Texas System, William H. McRaven \u2014 once a member of the Navy SEALs \u2014 said he did not think it would make students safer. The campus police at the University of Wisconsin-Madison issued a statement last week calling on legislators to reject a proposal to allow guns in campus facilities, including the football stadium. Under a state law passed in 2011, guns are allowed on campus grounds, but the administration may ban them inside buildings."]
["us", "Madison Laning, 20, the head of the student body government there, came out against the proposed legislation, warning that it would ultimately make things worse. \u201cIf \u2014 and hopefully never \u2014 we do have an active shooter on campus, it will make the P.D.\u2019s job so much harder,\u201d she said, referring to the Police Department, \u201cif there are multiple people running around with guns trying to find the shooter.\u201d Most legislatures are out of session now, so it may not be clear until next year if the recent spate of shootings \u2014 one person killed at Northern Arizona University, one at Texas Southern University and the 10 at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, including the gunman \u2014 will produce any change in weapons policy.

It\u2019s too soon to know, though true Bondologists will be parsing this new drink\u2019s significance shortly. As more of an amateur in all-things Bond, I had hoped a dirty bomb would go boom or that the actress L\u00e9a Seydoux would do something unspeakable to Daniel Craig, given that the pre-credit sequence features female nudes writhing alongside an octopus with busy arms. Part of the bankable pleasure of the series, after all, is that every so often, among the usual guns and girls, the unexpected happens \u2014 a bikini stops the film, a villain revs it up, Bond surprises. There\u2019s nothing surprising in \u201cSpectre,\u201d the 24th \u201cofficial\u201d title in the series, which is presumably as planned. Much as the perfect is the enemy of good, originality is often the enemy of the global box office. And so, for the fourth time, Mr. Craig has suited up to play the British spy who\u2019s saving the world one kill at a time, with Sam Mendes occupying the director\u2019s chair for a second turn. They\u2019re a reasonable fit, although their joint seriousness has started to feel more reflexive than honest, especially because every Bond movie inevitably shakes off ambition to get down to the blockbuster business of hurling everything \u2014 bodies, bullets, fireballs, debris, money \u2014 at the screen."]

If you have watched one Bond movie, you know the score. The band \u2014 M (Ralph Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) \u2014 gets back together, with Bond singing lead. There\u2019s an opening lollapalooza blowout that Mr. Mendes largely delivers in one long silky take, having clearly studied trends in contemporary art cinema. Mr. Craig and the camera move together beautifully in this sequence, whether Bond\u2019s sauntering across a roof (and in what has become a signature, adjusting a shirt cuff) or riding down a collapsing building as easily as you would a slide at a water park. There\u2019s more, of course, including car chases, nominally exotic locales and a pulpy, visceral slugfest on a passenger train with a Bluto-size hurting machine (Dave Bautista) who\u2019s evocative of that old Bond enemy Jaws. The train, as well as the purr of an Aston Martin, suggests that the filmmakers are working the nostalgia angle, though, the series has always been driven by longing for other men and worlds, for the British Empire, for a hyper-masculine savior, for sex kittens (friends or foes) and for a reassuring vision of the world in which the greatest threat is an orderly criminal organization run by a single supervillain. The superbaddie in \u201cSpectre\u201d is, alas, a bore, enlivened only by our series sentimentality and Christoph Waltz working his accented villainy with a smile."]
["movies", "Back in 2006, Mr. Craig slipped into \u201cCasino Royale\u201d and the role of James Bond like a middleweight\u2019s fist in a boxing glove, bringing to the gig a battered beauty one punch away from ugly, a powerful chest that looks good in a tux and a visceral predatory quality that works equally well for annihilating villains and ladies. Mr. Craig was the right Bond for a moment still haunted by Sept. 11: He looked roughed up, possibly cruel and ready to fight. That Mr. Craig could also deliver layered emotional intensity and unexpected expressive delicacy was a nice bonus for a series that sprang back with deadly solemnity and scarcely a trace of the playfulness, much less the campy joie de vivre, that\u2019s mostly associated with the Roger Moore era. \u201cI miss Roger Moore,\u201d a friend recently sighed. I don\u2019t, with sincere apologies to Sir Roger. I like Mr. Craig\u2019s Bond a lot, but I am also still pining for Sean Connery, the production designer Ken Adam and women whose names (performer and character alike) you remember, like Honor Blackman and Pussy Galore. Bond\u2019s creator, Ian Fleming, once said that he wanted 007 to be, as he put it, \u201can extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened.\u201d (Fleming borrowed the name from an ornithologist.) He also wanted Bond to be a \u201cblunt instrument.\u201d The spy proved as blunt as an anvil on Wile E. Coyote\u2019s head, but the casting of Mr. Connery obliterated any notion that Bond could be wholly dull. The Bond movies needed sex to sell their violence, especially to a wide audience, and Mr. Connery was the ideal salesman."]

The husband is a nail that leads to the shoe, the horse, the rider and finally the kingdom, little of which has anything to do with the world as it exists, with its environmental disasters and political uncertainties, religious wars and ordinary terrors. But then it\u2019s hard to imagine Bond taking on, say, the Islamic State. In 1966, Kingsley Amis attributed the success of the Bond stories partly to what he called the \u201cFleming effect,\u201d noting how Bond\u2019s fantastic world, \u201cas well as the temporary, local, fantastic elements,\u201d are \u201c \u2018bolted down\u2019 to some sort of reality.\u201d The Bond movies have always managed to tap into reality by switching on a camera, a connection to the material world that lingered no matter how far out the villains, their wild lairs and intrigues. The current Bond team is trying to keep the audience entertained with new tricks and gizmos while keeping it kind of real, which perhaps explains why this Bond sweats buckets, tears up and even bares his feelings.

The board, which is charged with investigating police misconduct, filed a court petition in May seeking evidence and testimony presented to the grand jury.

On Friday, Justice William E. Garnett of State Supreme Court on Staten Island questioned the review board\u2019s lawyer, Brian Krist, asking several times how the grand jury evidence would be safeguarded and who would be responsible if it were leaked. \u201cThere is curiosity or an honest desire to see it,\u201d Justice Garnett said. \u201cThere is that danger.\u201d Mr. Krist replied that the review board would be willing to designate one person to handle the evidence. \u201cWe would actively encourage the court to issue an order\u201d restricting its distribution, he added."]

Mr. Garner, who was unarmed and suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes, died after Officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold. A grand jury declined to indict Officer Pantaleo in December, leading to days of protests in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The decision not to indict also led to calls for the district attorney\u2019s office to make the grand jury records public, as prosecutors in Ferguson, Mo., had done after a grand jury there declined to return an indictment in the case of Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a police officer last summer. In March, Justice Garnett ruled against a group of plaintiffs who had sought the records, including The New York Post, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the public advocate, Letitia James. The judge wrote that they had failed to establish a \u201ccompelling and particularized need\u201d to make the grand jury minutes public.

Mr. Krist told Justice Garnett that the review board had been unable to complete its investigation because the district attorney\u2019s office had asked it to step aside temporarily.

Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3 ordered on Monday that every death on the island since the calamitous storm be reviewed. Officials will look again at all deaths attributed to natural causes after the hurricane, which made landfall Sept. 20 and knocked out power to 3.4 million Puerto Ricans \u2014 and to their hospitals and clinics. Parts of the island are still without power almost three months later, and the power grid is operating at only 70 percent of capacity. The prolonged blackout hampered critical medical treatment for some of the island\u2019s most vulnerable patients, including many who were bedridden or dependent on dialysis or respirators. But if they died as a result, the storm\u2019s role in their deaths may have gone officially unrecorded. \u201cThis is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said in a statement. The governor acknowledged on Monday that the death toll \u201cmay be higher than the official count certified to date\u201d \u2014 an apparent about-face for his administration, which has spent months stubbornly defending its counting method, even as it became obvious that it did not reflect the unusually high death rate in Puerto Rico after the storm. Several news organizations, including The New York Times, conducted independent analyses and found that the number of deaths traceable to the storm was probably far higher than the official count of 64."]
["us", "The Times\u2019s review, based on daily mortality data from Puerto Rico\u2019s vital statistics bureau, found that 1,052 more people than usual had died across the island in the 42 days after Maria struck. The analysis compared daily figures for 2017 with an average of figures for the corresponding days in 2015 and 2016. Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. CNN compiled figures from half the island\u2019s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. Official mortality figures from all causes on the island are revised often as the government obtains more information about events after the storm. Since The Times published its analysis on Dec. 8, Puerto Rico has recorded seven more deaths that happened in September and 31 more for October. Methods for counting storm deaths vary by state and locality. In some places, officials include only direct deaths, such as people who drown in storm floodwaters. Puerto Rico\u2019s method is not that restrictive; the medical examiner includes some deaths indirectly caused by a storm, such as suicides. The leading causes of death on the island in September were diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Puerto Rican government data show. But there was a sharp spike \u2014 by 50 percent \u2014 in the number of recorded deaths from sepsis, a complication of severe infection that can be tied to delayed medical care or poor living conditions."]
["us", "Reviewing the circumstances surrounding each death will require interviewing family members and doctors who signed death certificates to find out if, for example, a heart attack might have been brought on by stress from the hurricane, or might have been fatal because an ambulance could not get through debris-blocked streets in time to help.

Four days later, President Trump visited the island and remarked that the death toll \u2014 which officially stood at 16 at the time \u2014 was much lower than the 1,833 people who died in 2005 because of Hurricane Katrina.

SCA disputed the bonuses in arbitration in 2005, and the case produced the foundation of the doping evidence later used against him. Despite allegations of cheating, Armstrong continued to deny doping and the company settled with Armstrong and paid him $7 million in 2006.

Armstrong argued his original settlement could not be overturned under state law.

Herman noted Lyon\u2019s dissent said the panel was not deceived in the original settlement when it signed off on a voluntary agreement entered by SCA. \u201cThere is no Texas case or statute that allows for this type of sanctions motion nine years after the award was given,\u201d Lyon wrote in his dissent. Lyon\u2019s dissent also attacked SCA, writing that in 2005 the arbitration panel had found the company to have engaged in selling insurance in Texas without a license, which could have exposed it to more than $22 million in damages under Armstrong\u2019s original claims."]

Not a chance. No way. The last thing he would ever do. He simply said that \u201ceverybody\u201d around him had known about his drug use, and that snitching on those closest to him would be a violation of his duty to be loyal to those who had been loyal to him. If that was true \u2014 and, if the past is any indication, one can never be sure of the truth when talking to Armstrong \u2014 it must have been painful for him to turn on those friends late last year when he answered questions about his doping as part of a lawsuit. Armstrong settled the suit, which was brought by an insurance company seeking to recover $3 million in bonuses it had paid him for winning three Tour de France titles. But before settling, he reluctantly submitted answers to 16 questions about his doping, and those answers became public Wednesday as part of another lawsuit in which Armstrong is a defendant. In those answers, first reported by USA Today, Armstrong did exactly what he told me he would never do: He named some names."]
["sports/cycling", "A sampling: Johan Bruyneel, his longtime team manager; Chris Carmichael, the coach who made a name for himself as Armstrong\u2019s adviser; Michele Ferrari, Pedro Celaya, Luis Garcia del Moral \u2014 three doctors who worked either with Armstrong personally or for his United States Postal Service team; Pepe Mart\u00ed, a former trainer; and Thom Weisel, who supported the team financially. All of them have denied involvement in or knowledge of Armstrong\u2019s doping. But according to Armstrong, those men all knew the truth. They were just a few of the so-called everybody who knew his secrets. \u201cJohan Bruyneel participated in or assisted with Armstrong\u2019s use of P.E.D.s, and knew of that through their conversations and acts,\u201d the court document said. Of Carmichael, it noted, \u201cMr. Armstrong told Chris Carmichael in 1995 of his use of P.E.D.s.\u201d His testimony reminds the public that Armstrong has been the biggest loser in his doping scandal, while so many others who were involved in his doping cover-up have walked away unscathed. Carmichael still runs an Internet coaching business, which advises hundreds of athletes on how to get fit and fast. Bruyneel, Celaya and Mart\u00ed are still fighting their lifetime bans from the sport, cases that have dragged on for more than a year and a half. But in a roundabout way, Armstrong may have done something to help clean up the sport of cycling. Finally, though most likely not on purpose, he has made a positive mark. And while Armstrong might cringe at the thought of his being a tattletale, the information he gave about some of those people closest to him will be crucial in cracking the cycle of doping that has been a part of the sport for more than a century."]
["sports/cycling", "To help cycling regain its credibility and to protect its young riders, the people who have been entrenched in cycling\u2019s drug culture yet refuse to acknowledge it \u2014 team managers like Bruyneel, doctors like Celaya and team members like Mart\u00ed \u2014 need to be exposed and driven from the sport. Because they are the dealers and facilitators, and not the users, their influence in persuading riders to dope was much more extensive than Armstrong\u2019s ever was. And because of that, the United States Anti-Doping Agency should have gone after them more fiercely in the first place. But since Armstrong\u2019s fall, he has been the poster boy for all of the sport\u2019s woes \u2014 and even after his fall, the sport has remained in limbo. Brian Cookson, the International Cycling Union\u2019s new president, has talked about allowing people in the sport to come forward and confess their involvement with doping without fear of sanctions. That confessional would make it much clearer how riders have been able to dope without being caught. So far, though, it has been only talk. But Armstrong has made great strides. Though the public may never know the truth in the Armstrong case, at least he has stopped protecting some of those people who, he now admits, were complicit or directly involved in his doping. For more than a decade, they stood by while he looked into the eyes of millions of fans and said he had never, ever doped. Now he has admitted that many of his colleagues also knew that he was telling a massive lie."]

But in answering the very first question of the 16 in this latest case, Armstrong made clear that his answers would be different this time.

["books/review", "Book Review - Tocqueville\u2019s Discovery of America - By Leo Damrosch - The New York Times Glimpsing the human side of major historical figures is endlessly fascinating. As Melville noted, Shakespeare in his own day wasn\u2019t Shakespeare. He was Master William Shakespeare, the harried writer \u2014 mocked as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d by a critic \u2014 who churned out plays for the proprietors of the Globe Theater. Humanizing Alexis de Tocqueville \u00adposes special challenges. His magnum opus, \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d has gained prophetic stature since its publication in two volumes (1835 and 1840). Its grand pronouncements about America roll before us in chapter after sweeping chapter, each ringing with authority. Tocqueville covered many topics \u2014 government, commerce, law, literature, religion, newspapers, customs \u2014 in elegant prose that captured the essence of democracy. His insights, while sometimes debatable, are often eerily prescient. In \u201cTocqueville\u2019s Discovery of America,\u201d Leo Damrosch, the Ernest Bernbaum professor of literature at Harvard, reveals the man behind the sage. Damrosch shows us that \u201cDemocracy in America\u201d was the outcome of a nine-month tour of the United States that Tocqueville, a temperamental, randy 25-year-old French apprentice magistrate of aristocratic background, took in 1831-32 with his friend Gustave de Beaumont. The French government commissioned the pair to report on American prisons. But Tocqueville confided that he wanted to examine \u201call the workings of that vast American society that everyone talks about and no one knows.\u201d"]
["books/review", "Drawing from Tocqueville\u2019s private writings, Damrosch presents the young traveler as insatiably curious. After landing in Newport, R.I., in May 1831, Tocqueville and Beaumont visited 17 of America\u2019s 24 states and three of its sparsely settled territories. Writing down their impressions of the many Americans they met, including notables like John Quincy Adams and Sam Houston, they accumulated a huge store of information. Along the way, they fulfilled their original mission of exploring America\u2019s penitentiaries. The two main kinds of prisons they analyzed \u2014 one introduced in Auburn, N. Y., the other in Philadelphia \u2014 had special rigors. In the Auburn plan, which was employed at Sing Sing penitentiary, prisoners worked together for 11 hours a day but were not allowed to speak to or look at one another. \u201cIt felt like walking through the catacombs,\u201d Tocqueville wrote. \u201cThere were a thousand living beings there and yet it was a solitude.\u201d Whips were always ready for the recalcitrant. The Philadelphia system offered an even harsher discipline: perpetual solitary confinement. Every prisoner inhabited a thick-walled cell and had no contact with anyone but a chaplain who visited occasionally. Tocque\u00adville called this punishment \u201cat once the mildest and the most terrible ever invented\u201d \u2014 a comment substantiated by reports of the many prisoners who lost their minds or committed suicide."]
["books/review", "The prison tour was secondary to Tocque\u00adville\u2019s purpose of exploring American life in all its dimensions. Every place Tocqueville went, north and south, yielded valuable insights that found their way into his book. His visits to cities made it clear to him that Americans \u201cvalue everything on earth in response to this sole question: How much money will it bring in?\u201d He found that Americans were a restless, practical people, hungry for novelty and change yet committed to working hard to get ahead. With its energetic population and abundant resources, Tocqueville wrote, America \u201cwill someday become one of the richest and most powerful countries on earth.\u201d His excursions into the frontier and the Deep South exposed him to Indian culture, which he regarded sympathetically, and to slavery, which he accurately predicted would produce \u201cthe most horrible of all civil wars.\u201d While Damrosch\u2019s book doesn\u2019t come close to identifying real-life sources for all of Tocqueville\u2019s arguments \u2014 no book of such concision could do that \u2014 it usefully connects specific themes to certain Ameri\u00adcan locales. Cincinnati, for instance, was a particularly rich trove of information. A rapidly expanding city of 25,000, it struck Tocqueville as a place of \u201cabsolute social equality,\u201d without social hierarchies. But it enforced what he called \u201cvery severe laws against the blacks\u201d and thus exemplified the racism then rampant in America."]
["books/review", "The contradictions Tocqueville found in Cincinnati fed into his larger conclusions. America, he found, was a nation of paradoxes. It proclaimed that all men were created equal, yet was suffused by racial prejudice. It placed unparalleled faith in the individual yet was conformist and controlled by the majority. It was materialistic yet deeply religious, commercial but puritanical. It had a carefully conceived Constitution and a well-defined political system, yet its most important decisions sprang from public opinion and mores, not the government. Damrosch is an acute observer of Tocque\u00adville, whose generalizations, he notes, don\u2019t always stand up to scrutiny. Although Tocqueville was right about the importance of America\u2019s middle class, he minimized widening divisions between the rich and the poor. Tocqueville took an overly harsh view of Andrew Jackson, dismissing him as \u201ca man of violent temperament and mediocre abilities,\u201d ignoring his charisma and his political abilities. An agnostic raised as a Catholic, Tocqueville exaggerated the oddness of evangelical religion, misreading its social meaning for Americans. Still, as Damrosch suggests, Tocque\u00adville\u2019s responses to America were more perceptive and appreciative than those of other European travelers, like Frances Trollope and Charles Dickens. These visitors made pungent, informational comments about America but showed a provincialism that Tocqueville rose above. The fastidious Trollope portrayed America as a nation of boorish tobacco-chewers, bellowing revivalists and swaggerers. Dickens complained about the grunting pigs and screaming newsboys on the streets of Manhattan. For Tocqueville, such excesses were part of the liveliness and brashness of an ever-changing democratic society."]
["books/review", "Returning to France in March 1832 full of enthusiasm for the American system, Tocqueville set himself to writing his two large volumes. He told a friend, \u201cI\u2019ve hurled myself at America in a sort of fury. . . . I think about hardly anything else.\u201d The books made him famous, and he rose in the French government, which he hoped to help redesign. He said in a speech that he had seen in America that democracy could be \u201cliving, active and triumphant,\u201d and he urged his nation to follow America\u2019s example. For a brief period after the democratic revolutions of 1848, it seemed that France would heed his advice. But when Louis-Napoleon dissolved the National Assembly and announced himself Emperor Napoleon III in 1852, Tocqueville\u2019s democratic dreams were dashed and his political career was over. He was beset by personal problems. His wife grew frantic over his affairs. Having told her that he had \u201cvast desires\u201d and \u201cpassions that lead me astray,\u201d he was, in Damrosch\u2019s words, \u201cregularly (not to say compulsively) unfaithful.\u201d Subject to mood swings, he became increasingly depressed about his nation, which he compared to a man traveling on a moonless, foggy December night. He bitterly recalled the youthful ardor that had driven the writing of \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d which he no longer even looked at except to make corrections for reprints. When he died of tuberculosis at 53 in 1859, he could not know that his penetrating observations on America would stand as timeless statements about democratic society."]

The common criticism is that it is a marketing ploy. The National Weather Service seems to agree; it has advised its forecasters not to follow the channel\u2019s lead, and a spokesman said it had never named winter storms and had no plans to do so.

Expanded power for pro-Western parties is certain to be cheered by the United States and its European allies, which have staked a huge political and financial bet on Ukraine\u2019s ability to emerge from its current crisis as a stable state, and especially to be able to repay its debts."]
["world/europe", "The United States and European nations are also eager to end the worst violence on the Continent since the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s, and to resolve the most dangerous dispute between the West and Russia since the Cold War. That, however, is likely to hinge as much on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as on Mr. Poroshenko. An overwhelming pro-Western majority might also pose a challenge for Mr. Poroshenko as he tries to convince residents of the embattled east that their interests are also a priority in Kiev. Such skepticism is likely to be heightened because of the inability of so many residents of eastern Ukraine to participate in Sunday\u2019s election. Between the war zone and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in March, as many as 10 percent of voters might have been prevented from casting ballots, international election observers said. Rebel leaders had recently boasted that they controlled many polling stations in the east, and intended to block the vote. The exit polls showed Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s own coalition party running first in the polls but falling far short of winning a controlling majority on its own. That means he would be forced to form a coalition, most likely in partnership with People\u2019s Front, the party led by Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear that we have to reset the Parliament, the government and to establish the new rules in my country,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said after casting his own ballot here in Kiev, the capital. \u201cWe strongly believe that the new government, together with the new Parliament and the president will deliver real changes.\u201d"]

The exit polls showed one party that is generally regarded as pro-Russian winning enough votes to clear the threshold for forming a faction in the Parliament. That party, the Opposition Bloc, includes some of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s former allies with strong ties to the embattled east, and it could ultimately prove crucial to future negotiations with Mr. Putin and to resolving the simmering conflict there. The party is led by Yuri Boiko, a former deputy prime minister and energy minister under Mr. Yanukovych. Mr. Boiko also has served as energy minister and was head of the Ukrainian national energy company, Naftogaz, from 2002 to 2005, giving him extensive business dealings with Russia. The Opposition Bloc was also heavily supported by Sergiy V. Liovochkin, one of Ukraine\u2019s richest businessmen and a former chief of staff to Mr. Poroshenko.

As a result, the Parliament still included allies of Mr. Yanukovych who had pushed through draconian laws in January aimed at stopping the protests by curtailing rights to free speech and assembly. To opponents of the protests, the vote was an attempt to seal an illegal overthrow of the government, with the legitimacy of the balloting further clouded by the inability of many residents of the embattled east to participate. International observers said the election was technically well organized in the areas of the country that remained under the control of the Ukrainian government. Clearly sensitive to this, and to the government\u2019s continuing lack of control in the war zone, Mr. Poroshenko did not appear as expected at a polling station in Kiev on Sunday morning.

["sports/baseball", "Mets\u2019 Pitchers Are Hurting After a Loss  - The New York Times PHILADELPHIA \u2014  The Mets\u2019 young pitchers this season have provided hope for the future while simultaneously keeping the team on the periphery of the postseason race. It has been a delicate balancing act, through each exuberant Jenrry Mejia save and Jacob deGrom strikeout. On Sunday, though, a combination of unexpected injuries and old nemeses showed the Mets that sustained success may lie further down the road. Before the Mets lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 7-6, the team announced deGrom was headed back to New York to visit with physicians after experiencing soreness in his right shoulder. DeGrom will miss his next scheduled start, on Tuesday. Later, after blowing a 6-5 lead and giving up a winning hit to Ryan Howard with two outs in the ninth, Mejia revealed that in addition to dealing with calf tightness, he had been pitching with a hernia for the last three weeks. Each pitcher remained optimistic that his ailment would not be a long-term problem. \u201cI could probably go out there and pitch with it right now,\u201d said deGrom, who notified team personnel of the pain after his last start, on Aug. 7. He added, though, \u201cAt this time of the year, it\u2019s not really worth pushing it, and if I can skip one and be 100 percent and let it calm down, then I think that\u2019s what they kind of talked about.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "John Ricco, the Mets\u2019 assistant general manager, said, \u201cHe said he felt a little bit of soreness, felt better today, but we didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d Mejia said that the hernia was not affecting his pitching, but that he was given medication and told by team doctors to notify them if any additional pain arose. The Mets (56-62) are six and a half games out of a National League wild-card spot, by no means an insurmountable deficit yet one that is looking increasingly difficult to overcome, given the logjam of six teams ahead in those standings. DeGrom\u2019s injury and Mejia\u2019s recent struggles closing games may force the Mets to start protecting their 2015 roster, perhaps by limiting innings for their pitchers. Sunday\u2019s starter, Zack Wheeler, was limited to 100 innings last season, pitching his final game in mid-September, and Manager Terry Collins has said his innings count will be monitored as the year winds down. Against the Phillies, he threw 112 pitches for his eighth straight quality start, lasting six innings to push his season total to 1401/3. Wheeler allowed one hit through five innings, his only blemish coming on a first-inning solo home run by Chase Utley. Utley, who has perennially bedeviled the Mets, also accounted for the Phillies\u2019 second hit, a single in the sixth inning. After a Grady Sizemore walk, Domonic Brown doubled in two runs."]
["sports/baseball", "Wheeler left the game after the inning, still appearing to have an ample cushion as the Mets attacked Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick, often swinging on first pitches. The Mets got to Kendrick for six runs on 10 hits in his five innings, with back-to-back solo home runs by Lucas Duda and Travis d\u2019Arnaud in the fifth. In the seventh, though, Utley struck again, tripling to drive in two runs and cut the Mets\u2019 lead to 6-5. After a pinch-hit single by Marlon Byrd tied the game at 6-6 in the ninth, the Mets intentionally walked Utley. But Howard, another longtime Mets tormentor, singled in Byrd for the winning run, and the Mets left the field in a fashion all too reminiscent of recent years, looking not quite ready to fill the role of contender. The heralded prospects Rafael Montero and Noah Syndergaard are two possible options to replace deGrom in Tuesday\u2019s game, against the Washington Nationals. Ricco said that he had not discussed the situation yet with General Manager Sandy Alderson and that the Mets were waiting to hear the results of Monday\u2019s doctor visit before they made a decision. Ricco characterized deGrom\u2019s discomfort as \u201cnormal soreness.\u201d DeGrom, the National League rookie of the month for July, speculated that it could be caused by inflammation and added that he had not previously experienced any discomfort in the area, near the top of his shoulder. \u201cLast start I felt fine,\u201d said deGrom, who is 6-5 with a 2.87 earned run average. \u201cI actually felt like I got stronger at the end of the game.\u201d"]

["theater", "Review: John Leguizamo Goes for Easy Laughs in \u2018Latin History\u2019 - The New York Times Like the best mimics, John Leguizamo administers large but precisely calibrated doses of exaggeration to make his impersonations pop. In \u201cLatin History for Morons,\u201d a panoptic survey of two millenniums of oppression in the Americas, he tosses off dozens of quick character sketches that feel exactly as true as they are likely inaccurate. I rather doubt, for instance, that his prissy, nail-filing Moctezuma has any basis in fact. But who cares whether the Aztec emperor really lisped at Cort\u00e9s, \u201cYou leave me no choice \u2019cause you\u2019re so butch\u201d? What matters is that the laughs are real, in this case suggesting familiarity with the accommodations that proud people make to an overwhelming force. And so it is with almost every character brought to life in Mr. Leguizamo\u2019s long and often hilarious parade of injustice, stretching from Peru under the Inca to Texas under Trump. At their best, his jokes get at something deep, whether he is serving up a Rat Pack Christopher Columbus, a French poodle de Tocqueville, a sassy, cross-dressing Cuban-American Civil War soldier or a deaf uncle with an idiosyncratic way of signing. If only the character at the center of this frenetic one-man show were as convincing. But for the first time in his solo Broadway career, which began with \u201cFreak\u201d in 1998 and reached peaks with \u201cSexaholix\u201d in 2001 and \u201cGhetto Klown\u201d in 2011, Mr. Leguizamo is unable to make a convincing cartoon of himself."]
["theater", "That\u2019s a big problem in a show that, more than the others, depends on our buying an unlikely conceit that\u2019s presented as fact. When an eighth-grade schoolmate slurs his son as a \u201cbeaner\u201d \u2014 a Mexican, that is, though Mr. Leguizamo is Colombian \u2014 he gives himself the task of buttressing the boy\u2019s Latino pride with a look at the empires and achievements left out of the textbooks. \u201cLatin History for Morons,\u201d which opened on Wednesday evening, is supposedly the record of his research and self-re-education. So on a book-strewn classroom set by Rachel Hauck, the play intercuts cockeyed lectures about the past \u2014 from the decimation of the Ta\u00edno to the Trail of Tears \u2014 with an unlikely current-day family drama. In the lectures, Mr. Leguizamo comes off as a cross between Howard Zinn and Professor Irwin Corey, drawing impossible pie charts and ribald diagrams on a chalkboard and then acting out a brutal history in ludicrous skits. The physical comedy, often verging on dance, is priceless \u2014 \u201ctranslating thought into action worthy of an Iron Man competition,\u201d as Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times in March for his review of the Off Broadway premiere at the Public Theater."]
["theater", "But the family drama remains, as it seemed to me at the Public, rickety and unconvincing. Now as then, Mr. Leguizamo paints himself as a sitcom stick figure: a lovable schlemiel to his Jewish wife (who is \u201cintolerant of intolerance\u201d) and a dunderheaded dad to his up-speaking teenage daughter. Things are even worse with his son, whose bully problem is complicated by a homework assignment to write about a personal hero. Dad\u2019s relentless suggestions \u2014 Latino warriors and gentle geniuses he\u2019s discovered during his \u201cintellectual jihad\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t help. They were all, the boy points out, defeated. Mr. Leguizamo\u2019s dimwit stance is unsustainable, in part because much of the history, despite the show\u2019s premise, is actually quite familiar. You really would have to be one of the title characters not to be aware of cataclysms like the mass murder of Native Americans. And knowing that, you can\u2019t help feeling the falseness of the effort to wring droplets of sarcastic pride from disasters retooled as comedy. When Mr. Leguizamo compares the Spanish conquistadors to \u201cN.B.A. players at a Kardashian pool party,\u201d you begin to wonder which way the satire hourglass is running. Perhaps the apt comparison here is to Woody Allen, reconfiguring his idea of Jewish misfortune as wryness and working it out with a shrink. (Mr. Leguizamo\u2019s sessions with his patrician psychiatrist are especially hoary.) The problem is that this Latino nebbish persona isn\u2019t very credible when inhabited by a man of such obvious sophistication and sex appeal. You never believe his ignorance for a minute, any more than you believe his fatherly obliviousness. The setup and the emotional payoff it seeks are misaligned."]
["theater", "What is believable, though, is that the history Mr. Leguizamo outlines would make him angry. I wish he\u2019d given us more of that, especially in a hasty segment about a dust-up he says occurred at a conference he attended in Dallas. In the real incident, Mr. Leguizamo apparently told booing attendees that Texas \u201chates its Latino people\u201d \u2014 a provocation he omits in \u201cLatin History for Morons.\u201d Nor does he mention here that he canceled a tour and called for a boycott of the state after its governor signed a law that would allow the local police to stop people \u2014 Latinos, presumably \u2014 without probable cause. Instead, he turns the events into a comic scene about his own intemperance, which may also be true but is not as compelling. I get it: It\u2019s a comedy, and a baggy one at that. It is built to accommodate digressions about Thanksgiving and Santer\u00eda as well as opportunistic punch lines about Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. If the jokes land, does it matter so much that the framework is skimpy and the promised history skitters away from real danger? Or that the staging by Tony Taccone does little to regulate Mr. Leguizamo\u2019s excesses? When I saw it, some heavy milking \u2014 and, to be fair, gales of audience laughter \u2014 had the show running at closer to two hours than the advertised 95 minutes."]
["theater", "It does matter. This is, after all, a show in which Mr. Leguizamo can credibly say, despite all his success in theater, television and film, that he feels \u201clike a second-class citizen.\u201d \u201cLatin History for Morons\u201d would be richer if he didn\u2019t try so hard to make something so awful so funny."]
["nyregion", "After a Mess or Two, a Star Chef Starts Over - The New York Times The 18th-century French walnut door is back, hanging at the entrance of his latest restaurant in TriBeCa. In the foyer, the welcoming smell of apples has returned as well. And behind the stove, David Bouley himself is back, promising to cook every night just the way he did at his first restaurant, which many diners viewed as the best in New York City. Six years ago, Mr. Bouley was a man of grand dreams and dazzling ambitions, arguably the city's most brilliant chef, a man whose cooking talent was as wide as his ego. He closed his four-star restaurant, Bouley, at the top of its game, spinning out a vision of a gastronomic empire that would stretch from TriBeCa to Midtown. But today, New York's star chef and restaurateur is alone at the stove again. After a succession of unsuccessful partnerships, a run of feuds with colleagues and collaborators, and the upheaval caused by the World Trade Center attack, Mr. Bouley has abandoned -- or deferred, as he prefers to describe it -- nearly all of his plans: the restaurants, the cooking school, the huge food store. Even the Mohawk Building, a seven-story complex on Hudson Street that was to be Mr. Bouley's monument to cooking, is up for sale."]
["nyregion", "Mr. Bouley's vision of a culinary empire has come down to this: the low-slung building on West Broadway where his four-star Bouley Bakery has operated since 1997, and Danube, his three-star Austrian restaurant around the corner. Bouley Bakery, which Mr. Bouley had opened as a relatively modest restaurant and bakery to hold him over until his bigger dreams were realized, will henceforth be known as Bouley, and will be his signature restaurant, as the walnut door that came from the original Bouley around the corner and the apples are intended to make clear. ''I decided I didn't want to wear that real estate hat anymore,'' said Mr. Bouley, speaking at once softly and urgently, amid the construction clutter of his new -- or is it old? -- restaurant near Duane Street. ''I want to be a chef again. So I decided to put the door back on, and put the apples back.'' ''This is going to be my flagship,'' he proclaimed. ''I'm back with my jacket. I'm cooking every day. I've got to get back to where I left off.'' That Mr. Bouley has settled back to where he was six years ago is, to a certain extent, part of the story of what has happened to downtown New York since Sept. 11. The front windows of Bouley Bakery splintered from the force of the trade center collapse seven blocks south, and police barricades shut down both of Mr. Bouley's restaurants for months. In a neighborhood where the future of even the corner delicatessen seemed in doubt, Mr. Bouley's hopes vanished in the space of a morning."]
["nyregion", "Yet in many ways, the terrorist attack only hastened what even some of his former colleagues believe was the inevitable collapse of an enterprise that always seemed far too ambitious, proposed by a man whose business skills were not up to his culinary ones. From that perspective, Mr. Bouley is as much a victim of his own ambition and, in the view of a few former colleagues, arrogance, as of anything that might have befallen downtown New York. If Mr. Bouley is universally praised as one of the best chefs cooking today, he remains one of the most polarizing figures in his field. Even in this world, where a four-star review stirs envy and resentment, the kitchen knives come out for Mr. Bouley. For many of his colleagues, the news that the Mohawk Building is up for sale is Mr. Bouley's comeuppance. Whatever his successes, Mr. Bouley has left in the trail of his career a line of creditors, furious former employees and estranged friends. Many of the familiar faces at the old Bouley Bakery, among them his ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel and his executive chef, have abandoned him. The exodus was hastened as details of Mr. Bouley's contract with the Red Cross to provide meals to rescue workers at the trade center were reported in The New York Observer. Mr. Bouley was paid $5.8 million to produce 1,547,496 meals over 50 days, according to the Red Cross. He relied to some extent on donated food and volunteer workers, including some of his own employees, who were working without pay."]
["nyregion", "Mr. Bouley said the donated food and labor were crucial to ensure that he could provide Bouley-quality meals to the workers sifting through the destruction. Red Cross officials said they had approved the arrangement from the start, and factored in the savings in computing the fee per meal, which averaged $3.75. At the time, both of Mr. Bouley's restaurants were being used solely for the relief effort; he said he was not sure then that he would ever be able to reopen them. Still, fairly or not, Mr. Bouley found himself accused of profiteering by employees whose own Bouley paychecks stopped after Sept. 11. The report in The Observer singed his reputation when Mr. Bouley's business practices were already the subject of gossip, with food suppliers going to court to try to recover money they said he owed them. ''This man is just single-minded: what's good for him is all that matters,'' said Dominique Simon, Mr. Bouley's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, who quit last fall after 10 years at Mr. Bouley's side. ''He is the best cook that I know. But if you live with him, it's 'me, me, me, me.' '' ''I think it's immoral to make money from misery,'' Mr. Simon said. Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef and owner of Walls\u00e9 in the West Village, and a former chef for Mr. Bouley, said he had once considered Mr. Bouley ''a very close friend'' but had severed their relationship in frustration and anger after he came to the United States from Germany to help Mr. Bouley with his plans."]
["nyregion", "''He told me when I left in 1997 that I will be crying because I will not be part of his big empire,'' Mr. Gutenbrunner said. ''Well, I'm not crying. I'm doing pretty well.'' ''I don't speak to him anymore,'' he said. ''He lives in his own world.'' Mr. Bouley suggested that Mr. Simon was peeved that he had not been offered a position in Mr. Bouley's new restaurant. Beyond that, Mr. Bouley shrugged off such criticism, saying he did not want to get drawn into personal exchanges. The last chapter for Mr. Bouley began in 1996, when he entered what turned out to be a short-lived deal with Warner LeRoy, the owner of Tavern on the Green, to finance the culinary empire. At the time, Bouley Bakery and Danube were just the beginning. There would also be Bouley at Home, a 17,000-square-foot food store in TriBeCa. Mr. Bouley would design the menu at another LeRoy restaurant, the Russian Tea Room. And finally, there would be the Mohawk Building. Mr. Bouley had given up on the food store before Sept. 11, and Mr. LeRoy and Mr. Bouley dissolved their relationship in 1998 after an acrimonious court battle. Mr. LeRoy died last year. But the Mohawk Building remained central to Mr. Bouley's vision, even as it remained vacant and the subject of shifting plans year after year. As it turned out, Mr. Bouley said, on Sept. 14 he was to sign an agreement with new creditors that would have permitted him to build a 35-room boutique hotel above two restaurants in the building."]
["nyregion", "While this in many ways might be a story of a culinary Icarus, it would be a mistake to underestimate Mr. Bouley's prospects for success at the new Bouley, where the bakery was moved out to make room for an elegant 45-seat second dining room, and the restaurant is now open for business. For all the chaos and spatting over the years, he has managed to simultaneously operate both a four-star and a three-star restaurant in New York City. And at 48 years old, Mr. Bouley is engaging, enormously intelligent and an inexhaustible fountain of ideas on subjects including cooking and design. ''David can be the most charming man on the planet; that's part of his appeal,'' said Jay Cohen, a former Bouley sous-chef who is now the owner of Rio Bamba in Rochester. ''He also can be the most competitive man on the planet. Sometimes a person stops being themselves, and becomes their name and career. Sometimes it's hard for stuff like that not to go to your head. ''But it does not affect his cooking,'' Mr. Cohen continued. ''He's the best cook I've ever come into contact with. What he does is magic.'' Mr. Bouley's skills at the stove would appear not to extend to the details of running a business. Mr. Bouley is notorious for being slow to pay his bills, infuriating suppliers who have long gotten past debating whether this is the behavior of an absent-minded chef or the evasions of someone who has extended his finances too thin."]
["nyregion", "''I had to sue him; I had to freeze his bank accounts,'' said Robert Demasco, a partner at Pierless Fish Company. ''I don't care if he's a great chef or not; he doesn't do justice to the food industry. His big joke is that he gets away with it. Why does the media play him up?'' Ariane Daguin, the owner of D'Artagnan, a large supplier of specialty meats, said she was still trying to get Mr. Bouley to pay her $12,000. She said that the last time she encountered him, at a party at the restaurant Alain Ducasse, ''he really made his best not to say hello to me, not to be in the same corner of the room.'' When told that he was reopening his restaurant, Ms. Daguin burst out laughing. ''I'm not sure who's going to be his supplier, but whoever it is, he's going to be sorry,'' she said. For his most recent late payments, Mr. Bouley blamed a difficult stretch in which his bakery was losing money while he was saddled with the obligations of the Mohawk project. Mr. Bouley said he was mostly up to date and was trying to settle accounts. ''We had a hard time in the summer, and this year was tough because of the economy,'' he said. More problematic for Mr. Bouley's reputation, in the view of his friends, was the way his deal with the Red Cross was portrayed, as some of his employees suggested that he was using money from the disaster to cover his restaurant debts."]
["nyregion", "But from the start, according to Mr. Bouley and the Red Cross, Mr. Bouley made it clear that he would use volunteers and donated food to produce his meals. Red Cross officials offered praise for Mr. Bouley's performance during the disaster. ''He had kept his restaurant open and was feeding disaster workers,'' said Bob Chlopak, a spokesman for the Red Cross. ''There was a feeling on our front lines that this was a guy whose heart seemed to be into this thing. He may well have made a little bit of money off of this, but given the service provided, and the terms under which he provided it, we certainly felt it was fair and reasonable.'' Even Drew Nieporent, the Montrachet owner who leads the list of former Bouley partners who have spent years feuding with him, came to his defense here. ''There's a fine line between grandstanding and doing the right thing in a crisis,'' Mr. Nieporent said. ''I really don't believe he was grandstanding. I think he meant to do the right thing. I don't think he was capable of being malicious in this situation.'' As for Mr. Bouley, he said he was turning his attention to trying to adjust to this latest chapter in a very colorful career. ''Sure, I'm emotionally upset when I think about how much I put into it,'' he said. But then he perked up. ''My tractor has been in the mud for five years,'' he said. ''Now I'm going to take it across the room and see what I can harvest.''"]

Two Soccer Clubs Split by War. - The New York Times MITROVICA, Kosovo \u2014 Even among the flags and the sponsored jerseys and all the other trappings of the modern game, Bardhec Seferi could close his eyes and still see the waist-high grass. Seferi was standing on the soccer field at the Olympic Stadium Adem Jashari in this northern Kosovo city. Tall and now in his 50s, he had just watched Trepca, his former club \u2014 the team he had joined as a boy and played center back for as a professional \u2014 lose to the current champion of Kosovo, Feronikeli. Seferi seemed downhearted. The match was played on a weekday afternoon, and the crowd was tiny, just a few hundred people. Worse, the 1-0 defeat had sent the club drifting toward the bottom of the league. It was a bitter pill to swallow for anyone associated with such a proud team, which in the 1970s became the first from Kosovo to play in the top league of what was then Yugoslavia. In those days, 20,000 fans would have turned up to watch a team of Serbs, Bosnians, Croats and Kosovar Albanians playing together. But that was another time, and another country, before the wars that split Seferi\u2019s city, and his team."]
["sports/soccer", "Today, there are two Trepcas in Mitrovica: a Kosovar Albanian team in the south called KF Trepca and a Kosovar Serb team in the north called FK Trepca. Both have virtually the same team crest, and both play in uniforms of green and black. Both proudly claim a history that began when the original Trepca was formed in 1932. And while they now play in different national leagues, both claim that they are the true heirs to that club\u2019s past. After the 1998 Kosovo war redrew the city\u2019s ethnic map, FK Trepca now toils away in the lower tiers of the Serbian league, ousted from what it sees as its ancestral stadium. KF Trepca was started as a protest for independence before gaining membership in Kosovo\u2019s newly recognized soccer federation, playing in a stadium it claims through spiritual inheritance. \u201cWhen I came back here after the war, the grass here was so tall, you couldn\u2019t see your own belly button,\u201d Seferi said of the field that is today home to KF Trepca, making a swinging motion as if he held a scythe. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see anything. So all the players cut it ourselves. But we were home.\u201d Mitrovica once ranked among the richest and most vibrant cities in Yugoslavia. A city of minarets and Orthodox churches, it had a mixed Albanian and Serbian population that enjoyed nearly universal employment thanks to the nearby Trepca mines, which lent their name to the city\u2019s soccer club. As much as 70 percent of Kosovo\u2019s annual gross domestic product came from the mines, which yielded zinc, silver, gold and lead in huge quantities year after year."]
["sports/soccer", "The city\u2019s vast wealth helped propel its soccer club into Yugoslavia\u2019s top league in 1977, and its first cup final a year later. \u201cIt was one of the best leagues ever,\u201d recalled Seferi, who played in the 1980s and \u201990s. The players, whether they were from Serbia or Bosnia, were like family to one another, he said. He proudly displayed a photo that he keeps on his cellphone; it shows a younger version of himself, with curly black hair, scoring a header against Red Star Gjilan, in front of a large crowd. \u201cWe got along together just fine,\u201d he said of the multiethnic teams he knew. But by 1989, Trepca was struggling in Yugoslavia\u2019s third tier. And the team would soon be as divided as its country. After the death in 1980 of the communist leader Josip Tito, Yugoslavia began to fall apart. By the late 1980s, the rise of a new Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, a Serb, led to a crackdown on Kosovar autonomy. Protests broke out across the province, placing the dominant ethnic Albanian majority in open conflict with the state. More than a thousand of Trepca\u2019s miners staged an underground strike for eight days and nights. By 1991, Trepca\u2019s Kosovar players decided to leave the team. \u201cIt was a part of the politics of the Serbian side,\u201d Seferi said. \u201cThey said that if you want to carry on playing with us you have to accept our laws, our government. We were against it.\u201d"]
["sports/soccer", "Instead, Kosovo formed an illegal, parallel soccer league, holding games on improvised fields on short notice. \u201cThe police would stop games in the middle and arrest everyone, sometimes hold them for three days or sometimes just let everyone go,\u201d said KF Trepca\u2019s president, Ajet Shosholli. While the new Trepca team labored on poor fields and washed in freezing rivers after their games, FK Trepca continued in the lower reaches of the Yugoslav league without most of its Albanian players. \u201cIt felt horrible seeing them play,\u201d Seferi said. \u201cWe were playing in the countryside, getting injured. We got arrested. Bullied. But we kept playing.\u201d After eight years in the improvised Kosovo league, the players returned after the Kosovo war. The Olympic Stadium was now in the southern, Kosovar Albanian half of Mitrovica. Its grass was wild and its bleachers home to dozens of refugee families who had fled a bloody civil war. All of the club\u2019s cups and medals, more than 60 years of history, were gone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they were burned, or they were stolen, but they are not here,\u201d Shosholli said. \u201cAll the history was erased.\u201d Petar Milosavljevic remembers the last game Trepca played as a united team, in 1991. Trepca won, 2-0, but the atmosphere had changed. \u201cPeople were scared,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical things had come in the stadium.\u201d"]

He was surrounded by photos from the team\u2019s past. The club\u2019s name is written in Cyrillic above the door. The FK Trepca office contains a collection of its cups and medals, but none from before 1991. Milosavljevic had assumed the older trophies were still in the stadium, or stolen during the war. When war came to Mitrovica in 1998, FK Trepca, like the Albanians before it, had to leave the stadium. It has never been back. FK Trepca now plays in the fourth tier of the Serbian league system, traveling long distances to Serbian towns rather than playing other teams in Kosovo. The club shares a tiny stadium in the nearby village of Zvecan, and it has little money. But, Milosavljevic said, at least it is alive. From his balcony, he can see the other Trepca playing Kosovo league matches or training in the Olympic Stadium. \u201cI see every day Albanian players playing there and I am not there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my home.

The players all grew up through the war, and few can imagine when the two Trepcas might ever play together again. \u201cThey took our club,\u201d said Strahinja Jevtic, a defender who was waiting on a work visa to travel to Alaska. There is little work in Mitrovica now, north or south. The mine is hampered by bureaucracy and politics, and working at a fraction of its vast economic potential. Just a few hundred people work at Trepca now, mainly on the Kosovar Albanian side. \u201cWe used to play as one,\u201d Jevtic added, \u201cbut we won\u2019t ever again.\u201d The bus arrived at a tiny stadium, greeted by a bumpy field and a crowd of 30. Trepca quickly fell behind, 2-0. At halftime, the team angrily argued about its performance in the locker room before fighting back. Trepca scored to halve the lead and narrowly missed an equalizing goal before Orlovac broke free. The final score was 3-1."]

He said he was visited last year by Fadil Vokrri, the president of the Football Federation of Kosovo. Now that Kosovo has its own national team, the F.F.K. has been looking for ethnic Serbian players who will consider representing Kosovo, where around 150,000 Serbs live. But it is unlikely. \u201cFor now, the conditions do not exist,\u201d Milosavljevic said. Seferi, who still keeps in touch with his old teammates in the north, shared his hope for some sort of reconciliation between the two groups, and the two Trepcas. \u201cThere is an open invitation for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can join whenever they want.\u201d Yet now even the stadium\u2019s name is a barrier. After the war it was named after Adem Jashari, a founding father of the Kosovo Liberation Army. He is considered a hero by Kosovar Albanians, but a terrorist by the Serbs. Then there is FK Trepca itself, based in Kosovo but playing in Serbia\u2019s league. The Serbian soccer federation contends the club is legally the federation\u2019s. Kosovo\u2019s federation disagrees, arguing that the club\u2019s history, and future, are in Kosovo."]

["t-magazine", "How Blue Hill at Stone Barns Transplanted Its Farmhouse Feel Into a Sotheby\u2019s Gallery - The New York Times Michael Moore, Sotheby\u2019s director of events, continually outdoes himself \u2014 it\u2019s in his job description. With a three-person team, Moore produces more than 350 American events (and some abroad) for Sotheby\u2019s each year, the crowning jewel of which is the ultraexclusive dinner that precedes the high-profile New York contemporary auction each spring and fall. This year, Moore faced the task of topping last spring\u2019s contemporary dinner, for which Sotheby\u2019s flew in 16 chefs from Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant often cited as the best in the world, and asked them to recreate its dining experience right in Sotheby\u2019s New York flagship on the Upper East Side. (Moore and his team attempted to meet all of the chefs\u2019 requests, no detail too small \u2014 one consequence of which was a long, thorough search for just the right river rocks for Noma to serve its langoustines upon.) For this spring\u2019s dinner, which took place on Sunday, the answer lay closer to home \u2014 just about 30 miles upstate, at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Dan Barber\u2019s hyperliteral take on farm-to-table dining situated on 80 bucolic, sprawling acres, which just last week won this year\u2019s James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurant. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for them to come here in a truck with some waiters and serve their food,\u201d Moore explained at Sotheby\u2019s last Wednesday, in the final stages of planning the dinner, surrounded by half-hung paintings by Lichtenstein, Rothko, Warhol and many more. \u201cWe want to transplant Blue Hill into our gallery as much as possible.

But both the Sotheby\u2019s and Blue Hill teams took care not to include elements that would compete visually with the masterpieces on the walls: After all, as Moore noted, \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting between $300 million worth of paintings, you don\u2019t need big flowers.\u201d Instead of tall, colorful floral sprays, the arrangements were kept close to the table and understated in hue. \u201cWe were thoughtful to consider that there will be lots of color, so our color is very earthy and muted,\u201d Laureen Barber, the chef\u2019s sister-in-law and an owner of Blue Hill, said when T visited the farm last week.

I was a straight-up narc; an obsessive rule follower, always the kid hanging behind saying, \u201cYou guys, we\u2019re going to get in trouble!\u201d I was prone to out-of-body-style panic attacks that frightened my teachers and classmates. Like Val, I was an oldest child, performative and bossy, certain I could control the world by thinking about it enough and following an obscure set of rules that changed constantly.

We met at a time of mutual vulnerability, both of us unknowingly dating the same woman who seemed to take great pleasure in exploiting our trust and undermining our sanity.

As for me, my adrenaline skyrockets and I begin to imagine the many ways death can come to me (liver cancer, aneurysm, stray bullet). Eventually, I shut down mentally and physically, as though the terrible outcomes are predators that can only see me if I move. We are terrified of mostly opposite things. I am anxious about: insects, germs, disease and mortal injury and death, messy rooms, being late, not honoring my commitments. She is anxious about: rodents, money, her writing, her job, social interactions, conflict, people secretly hating her.

["sports/basketball", "Knicks Get Younger in a Hurry, but Aren\u2019t Quick to Abandon Playoff Hopes - The New York Times Jeff Hornacek has survived a few maelstroms already in his first year as the Knicks\u2019 coach. Derrick Rose, his star point guard, has gone AWOL, and Hornacek has watched a feud between Carmelo Anthony, his franchise player, and Phil Jackson, the team\u2019s president, play out in public. And through it all, there has been losing \u2014 much more, it is likely, than Hornacek envisioned before the season. Still, he has largely kept his cool, even though the Knicks\u2019 nonexistent defense has been hard to swallow. But Monday night, Hornacek could not keep his even keel. When the idea of tanking the rest of this season was brought up, he bristled \u2014 but not without maintaining his Midwestern pleasantness. To Hornacek, it seemed like a far-fetched idea. Why would the 24-36 Knicks suddenly focus on losing? Though the team\u2019s injuries, its self-defeating tendencies, and even its fans\u2019 preferences could support losing as a legitimate strategy, Hornacek would not entertain the idea. \u201cWho says we\u2019re trying to lose?\u201d Hornacek asked. No one, exactly, but it would be understandable if the team were pulled in that direction. Monday was a particularly difficult day for the Knicks. They fell, 92-91, to the Toronto Raptors at Madison Square Garden. DeMar DeRozan scored 37 points, including the winning jump shot with 1.9 seconds remaining after the Knicks did not use an available foul on Toronto\u2019s final possession. Anthony then missed a wide-open 3-pointer at the buzzer after scoring 24 points, and was so agitated that he walked to the other side of the court and flung his headband."]
["sports/basketball", "\u201cI should have made that shot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just frustration.\u201d The Raptors were without the All-Star guard Kyle Lowry because of a right wrist injury. The Knicks temporarily took advantage, running up a 17-point lead, but their offense slowed down and produced just 14 points in the third quarter, and Toronto clawed back and rode DeRozan to victory. All of this came after the Knicks, earlier in the day, waived point guard Brandon Jennings and lost center Joakim Noah to arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Just like that, two of their win-now free-agent additions were gone. Jennings is off to chase minutes and his next contract elsewhere; Noah must mend a knee injury that arose only in the past few days, Hornacek said, but may keep him out for the rest of the season. To replace Jennings, the Knicks signed point guard Chasson Randle, a 24-year-old second-year pro who went undrafted out of Stanford in 2015 and spent last season playing in the Czech Republic. Randle impressed the Knicks in training camp this fall but was placed in the N.B.A. Development League rather than on the N.B.A. roster. He signed with the 76ers and played eight games in Philadelphia before being waived last week. Randle is expected to be the Knicks\u2019 third-string point guard after the team concluded that it could not give Jennings the playing time he desired, and wanted to give the rookie Ron Baker an in-depth look."]
["sports/basketball", "Still, Hornacek insisted that the Knicks were not trying to make a run at better odds for a lottery draft pick. They have lost 23 of their last 31, but they still sit four and a half games out of the eighth spot for the Eastern Conference playoffs \u2014 they would have to pass four teams \u2014 and Hornacek seems intent on chasing that instead. \u201cAs a team, we\u2019re not thinking about losing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it comes down to, and we get a different draft pick, we\u2019ll worry about it then, but we\u2019re still trying to win.

["opinion", "Was Vietnam Winnable? - The New York Times My interest in the Vietnam War began in the early 1990s, when I took a college course on the history of the conflict. Part of what drew me to the subject was the visceral contempt that my peers, professors and intellectuals generally had not just for the war, but for its veterans. It seemed to me a profound wrong that the young men who had risked their lives in Southeast Asia were deemed less worthy than those who had stayed safe at home. The history of the war, as taught in my college classes, rested on two assumptions. First, that the war was unnecessary; the \u201cdomino theory,\u201d the idea that a Communist takeover in Vietnam would cascade through the rest of Southeast Asia, was wrong. Ho Chi Minh was more of a nationalist than a Communist \u2014 and therefore, America needn\u2019t have worried about \u201closing Vietnam.\u201d The fact that most of the dominoes did not fall after South Vietnam\u2019s defeat in 1975 was Exhibit A. The second assumption was that the war was unwinnable. According to the orthodox historical narrative, the United States never could have won the war because of the dedication of the Vietnamese Communists, which was said to be far superior to that of America\u2019s South Vietnamese allies. No alternative strategies could have achieved success, and hence America was fated to abandon South Vietnam after sustaining prolonged casualties."]
["opinion", "As I pursued the study of Vietnam into graduate school, I began to question both these assumptions. By delving into the conflict\u2019s deep crevices, I came upon a wealth of untapped information pointing me in a different direction. (I owed many of those discoveries to Merle Pribbenow, a retired linguist who found and translated a wealth of documents and histories from the opposing side.) These North Vietnamese sources shed extraordinary light on longstanding debates. They showed that North Vietnam controlled the South Vietnamese \u201cresistance\u201d from the beginning, even while Hanoi\u2019s propagandists convinced gullible Westerners that it was a purely local movement. They also refuted the widely held view that the South Vietnamese government was reeling militarily at the time of Ngo Dinh Diem\u2019s assassination in November 1963. Other discoveries resulted from investigation into hitherto neglected aspects of the war. No previous historian had looked in detail at what was taking place in the neighboring \u201cdominoes\u201d when Lyndon Johnson made his fateful decision in 1965 to insert American ground troops into the war. In fact, in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, anti-Communist leaders were warning that South Vietnam\u2019s fall would cause all the Southeast Asian dominoes to fall, and were offering to commit troops to the anti-Communist cause. Suddenly, the domino theory looked far more plausible."]
["opinion", "As the huge size of the unexplored territory became apparent to me, a projected single-volume history of the war turned into a trilogy. The first volume, covering 1954 to 1965, took seven years to complete. Titled \u201cTriumph Forsaken,\u201d it was promptly termed \u201crevisionist,\u201d since it fundamentally challenged the reigning orthodoxy, joining a small number of other books in that category such as Lewis Sorley\u2019s \u201cA Better War\u201d and H. R. McMaster\u2019s \u201cDereliction of Duty.\u201d The book showed that Ho Chi Minh was a doctrinaire Communist who, like his Soviet and Chinese allies, adhered to the Marxist-Leninist view that Communists of all nations should collaborate in spreading the world revolution. By the time of Johnson\u2019s decision to deploy ground troops into South Vietnam, Ho and his allies were nearing their objective of turning all of Southeast Asia Communist, and they most likely would have succeeded had the United States bailed out. American intervention made possible an anti-Communist coup in Indonesia and the self-devastation of China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, and it bought time for other Asian dominoes to shore up their defenses. Not only was the war necessary, I argued, but it was winnable with better strategic decisions. The most momentous blunder was the decision of the American ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, to foment the coup that overthrew Ngo Dinh Diem, which wrecked the South Vietnamese security apparatus and led North Vietnam to initiate a huge invasion of the South. Another mistake was Johnson\u2019s decision to not insert American ground forces into Laos to block the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a move that would have transformed the war and reduced the need for American forces."]
["opinion", "The book generated considerable discussion in academic circles, including a volume of responses, \u201cTriumph Revisited.\u201d Some of the resulting conversation was constructive, but much of it was dismissive, petty, even ad hominem, particularly when it came from veterans of the antiwar movement and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Although a minority of professors welcomed a well-substantiated challenge to conventional wisdom, the collective hostility coalesced wherever I applied for an academic faculty position. I bring this up not to gain admittance to the nation\u2019s ever-expanding victim class \u2014 my misfortunes with academia led to the unexpected good fortunes of teaching terrific students at America\u2019s military universities and conducting research on pressing topics. Rather, it is to point out the dangers to society of a politicized academia. When a profession that claims to thrive on new ideas and debate instead ostracizes those who challenge certain orthodoxies, it deprives students of access to serious thought and encourages the rest of society to ignore it. The only way for the profession to regain its relevance is to show that it is open to challenges, and that it will give serious consideration to new ideas. Challenging the orthodoxies around Vietnam is as important today as it has ever been. While working as a consultant in Afghanistan, Iraq and other conflict zones, I saw politicians, military officers, journalists and political scientists seek to apply the lessons of Vietnam. The more I saw, the more I became convinced that superficial historical understanding and excessive reliance on academic theorizing were yielding bad advice \u2014 advice that could get men and women killed, that could even lose wars."]
["opinion", "In fact, my most recent research, focused on the events of 1967, casts important new light on how domestic conversations about war can have a decisive effect. Among the most fascinating developments of 1967 was the Johnson administration\u2019s regret about its decision to refrain from generating support for the war by discussing the necessity for it in public. The lack of public enthusiasm for the war, administration officials now realized, was encouraging the enemy to believe that the United States would eventually abandon its ally, and therefore North Vietnam had no reason to desist. \u201cThe administration made a deliberate decision not to create a war psychology in the United States,\u201d Secretary of State Dean Rusk remarked that October, because it was \u201ctoo dangerous for this country to get worked up.\u201d Johnson, Rusk and other officials had feared that war fever would undermine the domestic programs of the Great Society and heighten tensions with the Soviets. But now, Rusk conceded, \u201cmaybe this was a mistake; maybe it would have been better to take steps to build up a sense of a nation at war.\u201d During 1967, White House advisers and foreign leaders repeatedly urged Johnson to change course, to tell the American public why the United States was in Vietnam and what it was trying to achieve. But Johnson could not bring himself to do it, even as he increasingly recognized the damaging consequences of his silence. \u201cIf history indicts us for Vietnam,\u201d Johnson admitted in the fall, \u201cit will be for fighting a war without trying to stir up patriotism.\u201d"]
["opinion", "In the absence of presidential cheerleading, American public support for the war declined over the course of 1967. As administration officials had feared, the apparent weakening of American resolve hardened the determination of the North Vietnamese to persist. Hanoi rebuffed every American overture for peace negotiations, anticipating that the coming Tet offensive would destroy what remained of America\u2019s will. In other words, the public\u2019s turn against the war was not inevitable; it was, rather, the result of a failure by policy makers to explain and persuade Americans to support it. Today, with the country engaged in two distinct, long-running conflicts and the possibility that others could flare up at any moment, it\u2019s a lesson that our current leaders should take to heart."]

Joining the victory lap and garnering a Tony nomination in her Broadway debut is the play\u2019s original director, Pam MacKinnon. A Chicago native raised mostly in suburban Buffalo, Ms. MacKinnon, 44, apprenticed with the director Des McAnuff, was an early member of the Downtown New York company Clubbed Thumb and has become, among other things, something of an Edward Albee specialist.

He lent the jerseys to friends to wear to the nightclubs where they talked up his product and handed out his cards. James was often seen in vintage Joe Namaths or Magic Johnsons, and Paul always had a pile with them as they traveled the A.A.U. circuit.

Maverick Carter and Randy Mims, two lifelong friends of James\u2019s, were also put on the payroll, and the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d were born. They had a signature handshake, and they put a silhouette of a knight on their tennis shoes. They promised one another that they would be more than an entourage or posse.

LeBron had no obligation to me. I was not entitled to anything. I wanted to be valuable.\u201d In 2006, the Four Horsemen essentially rebranded themselves. James fired his agent Aaron Goodwin and formed L.R.M.R. Management Company (using the first initial of each\u2019s name). They had decided to take care of the LeBron James brand themselves. Maverick Carter was put in charge of the firm. Randy Mims continued to serve as James\u2019s chief of staff, coordinating his travel and his daily schedule. Paul told James that he wanted to become an agent \u2014 his agent \u2014 but knew he needed more exposure to the business. \u201cHe wanted to learn the ropes,\u201d James said. \u201cI told him whenever you are ready, let me know.\u201d So Paul went to work for James\u2019s agent Leon Rose, who had negotiated James\u2019s extension with the Cavs in 2006 and whose practice was bought by C.A.A. the following year. No one was surprised that Paul was good at recruiting talent, bringing aboard N.B.A. players like Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Tristan Thompson and Eric Bledsoe.

Ten days later, Klutch Sports Group was open for business, and its first client was the most coveted in all of sports: LeBron James. Thompson and Bledsoe, along with San Antonio guard Cory Joseph and Washington Wizards forward Kevin Seraphin, signed with Paul as well. But the doubts and badmouthing among the tribe of 4-percenters were immediate and nasty. The griping dismissed Paul as merely a frontman for James. Critics questioned how someone with only a high school diploma could become a certified agent, and they wondered how hard it could be to represent LeBron James. Paul shrugs it all off. He insists that Klutch is all his and that he is off James\u2019s payroll. The N.B.A. Players Association does not require a college degree, and most agencies bring on legal teams to handle the contracts, as Paul has. (Paul has brought in the veteran agent Mark Termini to oversee contract negotiations, and he works with the lawyer Fred Nance, once a finalist for the N.F.L. commissioner\u2019s job, and a battery of lawyers at his firm, Squire Patton Boggs.)

This summer, Paul told Griffin that James was interested in returning, but said there were no guarantees. \u201cOnce LeBron started getting serious about Cleveland, I knew he needed to sit with Dan in person,\u201d said Paul. \u201cHe had to talk to him directly.\u201d"]

Today, La Voile opens for its first season since Canino and his team earned their star. Canino, who describes his style as \u201clight and well-balanced with a focus on vegetables,\u201d is keeping the momentum going with a spring menu that uses only natural sugar, no fats aside from the finest olive oil, and mostly locally sourced ingredients \u2014 some from the kitchen\u2019s own on-site garden, which grows fava beans, peas, 10 varieties of tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant, strawberries and more, as well as herbs like thyme and rosemary. There are also orange, lemon, cherries, prickly pear and plum trees. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to be located in the middle of a nature preserve,\u201d Canino says. \u201cIt enables us to pick all of our products by hand.\u201d The result is a menu filled with healthy, ecologically conscious and flavorful choices: starters like green asparagus with farm eggs and morels sauce, and mains like the restaurant\u2019s signature tuna dish, served with a salade ni\u00e7oise and quail egg. Says the chef, \u201cFor me it\u2019s simple: I don\u2019t want to alter what\u2019s on my plate. The product is naturally flavorful, I enhance the taste. Simple and tasty. \u201d"]

["opinion/campaign-stops", "Wait. Which Party Is Imploding? - The New York Times Gail Collins: Arthur, I\u2019m so pleased to be conversing with you about this election. I miss my old pal David Brooks, but David\u2019s just got too much on his plate to pick up one more project right now. And I get another Brooks! I will refrain from making any water-related jokes. But about that election. I expect Republican presidential candidates to obsess about taxes and regulations. Hasn\u2019t necessarily been thrilling, but reliable. This year, though, the Democrats seem to be arguing about economic issues way more than your guys, who are obsessed with immigrants, terrorists and being politically incorrect. Let\u2019s start with the basics. Does it seem to you that the Republican Party is imploding? Arthur Brooks: Gail, I\u2019m delighted to join you, after enjoying your past conversations with our mutual friend, the other Brooks. This change sort of reminds me of those supporting-actor switcheroos they used to pull on TV, where you\u2019d say, \u201cWait \u2014 didn\u2019t the husband on \u2018Bewitched\u2019 used be a different guy?\u201d But yes, that election. Interesting times on both sides. I\u2019m not quite ready yet to concede that the Republican Party per se has fundamentally changed, mostly because Donald Trump is an island \u2014 an island where all the press has crowded. Most of the other candidates are trying to talk about things besides building walls. And downstream at the state level, the number of Republican governors has expanded to 31 from 19 during the Obama administration. When Republicans win Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois, you know they are doing something right."]
["opinion/campaign-stops", "Not too surprising, then, that Democrats are hoping to attach Trump to every pragmatic Republican at every level. One of the most ham-fisted attempts to do this came from the Democratic National Committee right before Thanksgiving. Inadvertently feeding the old trope about liberal hostility toward family values, they launched a misanthropic website called yourrepublicanuncle.com, which gave young people tips on how to shout down older Republican relatives at Thanksgiving. I\u2019m not making this up. Here\u2019s a sample. Your uncle says, \u201cKasich seems like a moderate guy.\u201d Your suggested comeback? \u201cJohn Kasich might as well be Donald Trump.\u201d Subtle! Someone at the D.N.C. got paid for that. I thought of starting a website called yourpoorlysocializedleftwingniece.com, full of tips for next Thanksgiving on vegan recipes for one. Gail: Yeah, the really useful holiday conversation helper would probably be \u201cHow to Change the Subject on Thanksgiving.\u201d But about those governors. It\u2019s true that a number of blue states have Republican governors right now. And New York City has had a lot of Republican mayors. To get elected, they convince voters that they\u2019re basically just thriftier Democrats. It works fine for state and local elections. But I\u2019m deeply dubious that these guys are a pipeline of potential presidential nominees. It\u2019s too hard for them to convince real, hard-core Republicans that they\u2019re reliable. So I would concede that it\u2019s a weakness for the Democrats not to be developing a bigger farm team of politicians who can get Republicans to vote for them."]

Jeb Bush is Mitt Romney without the electricity \u2014 hehehehe. And Chris Christie is going to do about as well as Rudy Giuliani did. John Kasich is the most interesting of the pack, but he doesn\u2019t do well on TV. And you remember how well Scott Walker worked out. You could posit that Donald Trump, Manhattan real estate celebrity, is the equivalent of a Democrat who learned to appeal to Republicans. Armed with an absolute genius for changing his positions without acknowledging there\u2019s anything different. Of course I wouldn\u2019t argue that myself. I\u2019m still studying up on what to tell my Republican uncle on, um, Groundhog Day. Arthur: I agree with a lot of your assessment, but would add one not-very-original point. Part of the reason the more mainstream candidates have fared poorly is simply because there are many of them and that has fragmented the vote. We can identify three distinct groups within the national polls: Trump, at about 30 percent; Cruz, around 20; and Rubio-Bush-Christie-Kasich, with another 20-25. Obviously, Trump is still outperforming the traditional candidates. But as a whole, that last group is still competitive \u2014 just not when it\u2019s split four ways. That will probably be the case until there\u2019s more winnowing in the field. Gail: I like the winnowing image. Sort of enjoying the idea of Marco Rubio being winnowed.

In Illinois, Bruce Rauner is really going after public sector unions, hammer and tongs. Of course, you could make the case that this will fail and Illinois will ultimately return to its old ways, electing governors who bankrupt the state while getting fitted for orange jumpsuits. But let\u2019s wait and see. I actually think that conservative reform is catching on at the state and local level. But I have a question for you.

But as long as we\u2019re on the subject, what\u2019s your analysis? Arthur: As a social scientist, I have been watching the so-called expert analysis unfold on this with real interest.

Going all the back to 2008 with Obama\u2019s infamous \u201cthey cling to guns or religion\u201d line (at a fund-raiser in San Francisco, no less), there has been a tangible sense that this president cares more about virtually anyone else than he does about working-class people, who have been absolutely hammered by the recession. A psychologist once told me that most human conflict stems from poorly concealed contempt. Research shows that contempt is the best predictor of divorce. And I think it is part of what has sparked the Trump movement. Gail: That \u201cguns or religion\u201d moment has haunted President Obama for the last eight years. One of the first times a candidate got hammered when his private fund-raiser talk wound up on YouTube. Like I said, digital age. Arthur: That sense of contempt had been brewing for a long time, but it didn\u2019t have much of a formal platform because the leading Democrat was still Bill Clinton, who isn\u2019t a contemptuous sort of person and has working-class roots. But a cultural cold war was in the works and that turned it hot.

The company also said it would ask its suppliers to report to it annually on their use of antibiotics, and asked them to limit treatment with antibiotics to animals that are sick. The guidelines Walmart issued are voluntary, and the company did not publicly set a deadline for its suppliers to follow its recommendations or say what would happen if a supplier failed to comply. Animal welfare groups, some of which have targeted Walmart\u2019s supply chain in the past, generally applauded Friday\u2019s decision, saying that the company\u2019s market clout would probably compel much of the industry to adopt better standards. The decision also applied to Sam\u2019s Clubs, the warehouse club unit of Walmart. \u201cWe have listened to our customers, and are asking our suppliers to engage in improved reporting standards and transparency measures regarding the treatment of farm animals,\u201d Kathleen McLaughlin, the senior vice president overseeing Walmart\u2019s sustainability program, said in a news release. Over the last several years, dozens of companies have announced commitments to better animal welfare and to eliminating the use of human antibiotics from animal husbandry. McDonald\u2019s won applause when it announced in March that it would begin using meat from chickens that are not raised with antibiotics important to human medicine, and a month later, one of its major chicken suppliers, Tyson Foods, said it would stop using such drugs in poultry production by 2017."]

Gail Hansen, senior officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 antibiotic resistance project and a former public health veterinarian for Kansas, said Walmart had gone further than any other company in moving to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry by asking its suppliers to submit annual reports. Walmart noted that while compliance with its wishes on antibiotic use was voluntary, many of its suppliers \u2014 it pointed to Smithfield \u2014 already report their use of the drugs on their websites. As for why the company made compliance voluntary, Kevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, noted that it had taken the same position in the past when prodding suppliers into more sustainable practices. \u201cWe\u2019ve\u00a0worked with our suppliers collaboratively in a similar fashion to drive positive change across many issues over the years, such as sustainable packaging reduction or compaction of laundry detergent, which were game-changing initiatives in their time,\u201d Mr. Gardner said."]

It asked, however, that Walmart \u201cadd greater teeth\u201d to its announcement by requiring its suppliers to comply with the standards and give them a timetable for doing so. Many companies and animal producers have worked with the Humane Society of the United States and other animal rights organizations and begun gradually working to phase out things like the narrow stalls in which pregnant sows are kept and what are known as battery cages, where laying hens live in a space about the size of a filing cabinet drawer."]

Jones has received as much praise from avant-garde aficionados (in 1998, the Village Voice critic Deborah Jowitt wrote, approvingly, of Jones\u2019s \u201cpolitically charged pieces,\u201d in which \u201ceven beauty seems to pose an enraged challenge\u201d) as from the mainstream (in 2009, the Times critic Ben Brantley gushed that Jones\u2019s Broadway musical \u201cFela!\u201d left audiences feeling like they \u201chave been dancing with the stars ... And I mean astral bodies\u201d)."]
["t-magazine", "And yet, Jones has also been critiqued with uncommon rancor. In her 1994 piece \u201cDiscussing the Undiscussable,\u201d the New Yorker critic Arlene Croce argued that Jones had become \u201cliterally undiscussable.\u201d The premise of Jones\u2019s major midcareer work, \u201cStill/Here,\u201d offended the critic so profoundly that she refused even to see the piece \u2014 a meditation about mortality in which Jones incorporated the movements of terminally ill people whom he\u2019d met in the free dance workshops he\u2019d set up for them, the patients becoming, in a sense, collaborators. \u201cBy working dying people into his act,\u201d Croce wrote, \u201cJones is putting himself beyond the reach of criticism. ... the most extreme case among the distressingly many now representing themselves to the public not as artists but as victims and martyrs.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to read Croce\u2019s assessment today and not see the critic as having misunderstood Jones in the very way that Rilke cautioned against; by 1994, Jones, already famous as a gifted dancer and choreographer, had also become famously associated with AIDS after the death of his partner, Arnie Zane, and after the publicizing of his own HIV-positive status. But Croce\u2019s piece also went precisely to how, since the 1970s, Jones\u2019s own story has been variously at the center of his art: an aesthetic choice to initiate a dialogue over the place that a gay black man has in contemporary American life. For two generations now, his work has attempted to provoke, in the manner of a person intent on steering a conversation toward the uncomfortable, in order to yield understanding."]
["t-magazine", "Jones is himself a gifted talker, as I discovered under an umbrella shading the worn wooden wheel of a table on his deck, where he was giving me a sort of master class on 20th-century dance. The reason for my visit was to discuss the genesis and evolution of his newest work \u2014 an ambitious three-part cycle of dances called \u201cAnalogy,\u201d which I\u2019d been watching his company develop. While invisibly refilling our water and wine glasses as we ate chicken soup and fresh cornbread that his husband and companion in all things, the artist Bjorn Amelan, had made us for lunch, Jones was also talking about his love of W.G. Sebald\u2019s \u201cThe Emigrants,\u201d its nested narratives telling the stories of four Jewish lives touched by the Holocaust, as well as the struggle he had lately been having with Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses,\u201d which he and Amelan have been reading to each other. Amelan, a warm and decorous French Jew who retains a central casting accent despite two decades in America, was indoors while Jones and I spoke, keeping half an eye on his 95-year-old mother, Dora, a Holocaust survivor, who visits them for several weeks every year and calls Jones \u201cher third son.\u201d As Amelan worked, Jones explained how dance had evolved in the 20th century, from what he called \u201cthe well-made dance\u201d of George Balanchine, with its exquisite precision and elegant, finished forms, to the postmodern dances of the \u201960s that disrupted that soothing elegance to admit novel features: singing and talking, for instance. Also: not dancing, in the way that John Cage\u2019s music had showed us that silence in expectation of music that never begins can itself be music. Jones gave me a sense of what it meant when he took his first steps onto those first stages, in the 1970s. His dances were designed to get the audience \u2014 almost completely white, then as now \u2014 to examine what they were doing, sitting there, watching an aggressively beautiful, half-naked, young, gay, out black man dance for them. It was, absolutely, an intimidation."]
["t-magazine", "\u201cIn the era of when people were discovering identity politics,\u201d Jones said in his rambling baritone, \u201cfor someone to step up and say: I am aware of what you see when you look at me. \u2018Oh such narcissism! Such self-involvement!\u2019\u2009\u201d Jones adopted a different voice here as he collated past responses to his work, essentially performing the argument. \u201cWell, no,\u201d Jones said, returning to his own voice, \u201cQuite frankly, you \u2014 usually it\u2019s white people \u2014 have a lot of problems actually looking at me, at who I really am. And I am now giving you permission to do so. I am going to move; I am going to gesture; I\u2019m going to be speaking in a way that\u2019s very personal, and yet I\u2019m going to be dancing in another way, and you will be obliged to decide how to process it all and make it into a thing which you and I agree is supposed to be happening here: an artistic event is supposed to be happening here.\u201d"]
["t-magazine", "Conversation, for Jones, is itself an artistic event. Confrontation is at its heart, and his tactics are varied and surprising. I saw Jones\u2019s jousting mode last spring, before an audience at Bard College where I teach. His company had just performed an early version of the first part of \u201cAnalogy,\u201d called \u201cDora: Tramontane,\u201d which draws on his mother-in-law\u2019s personal history, that of a Jewish girl in a Jewish family that, like so many families of the era and the region, was, during the war, vandalized by fate. After the performance, during a Q. and A. with Jones and his company, the moderator asked a question about what it takes for someone like Dora to stand up and resist, and whether a piece like this can inspire people to act. Jones took the question seriously. \u201cI am making this work to satisfy my artistic desires,\u201d he said, \u201cbut behind it I\u2019m also trying to make a work that might be like in the black church, when somebody stands up and says: \u2018Yes! I have a problem!\u2019 They say it to the community. \u2018I am weak! I wanna be strong!\u2019 And somebody in the community says. \u2018Amen! I hear you! I hear you!\u2019 And that\u2019s why the black church has been a political organ. Literally, it starts there. Now, what\u2019s your church? And those of you who are breeding and having children, what is the creed that you will demonstrate every day?\u201d"]
["t-magazine", "Jones\u2019s question to the audience wasn\u2019t entirely rhetorical. He had given, and now he wanted the students to give back. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d he later asked one of them. \u201cWhat are you pushing against? Is this your world? Do you feel this world wants you?\u201d Like his conversation, his dance compositions require a give and take. Consider Jones\u2019s first solo on a big stage, at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, in 1977, from a piece called \u201cEverybodyWorks/All Beasts Count.\u201d During the course of the solo, Jones tells a true, brief story about visiting two of his mother\u2019s sisters, his \u201caunties.\u201d The text, which quotes them, goes: Those blanks aren\u2019t blank, just silent, as Jones mouths, big and clear, so that even the non-lip-reading among us can\u2019t miss it, \u201cWHITE,\u201d as if white were a dirty word, something you shouldn\u2019t say out loud. As Jones is telling this story, his hands are busy, repeatedly, constantly telegraphing a series of numbers via sets of extended fingers \u2014 a set of three, a set of two, a set of four \u2014 the pattern of a Social Security number, in this case Jones\u2019s actual Social Security number. Thus the question of identity \u2014 what defines each of us as a human being, the features by which we are measured \u2014 was being performed. As Jones has said: \u201cWhen I came into the art world in the \u201970s, it was the time of Minimalism. It was extreme aesthetics. Extreme formalism.\u201d In \u201cEverybodyWorks,\u201d Jones was adapting that aestheticism to his own, more political aims."]
["t-magazine", "\u201cWe want to say that dance is supposed to be the freest medium of them all,\u201d Jones told me after lunch, adopting as he sometimes does the first person plural, asking his listener to think along with him. \u201cDance is supposed to transcend language. Dance is supposed to be universal language. When I move my arm, we all have an arm: We can feel this. When I run, we can all feel it.\u201d \u201cWhen you leap, we leave the ground,\u201d I said. \u201cYes. \u2018Now what\u2019s this?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said, assuming the voice of a dismayed audience member. \u201c\u2009\u2018You\u2019re leaving the ground but you\u2019re talking about ... 1942? Would you just shut up and let me enjoy leaving the ground?\u2019 Well, no. You\u2019ve left the ground many times. You can go see that all the time. But I\u2019m going to expose you to my preoccupations. There\u2019s something about that ephemeral moment on stage that I want to be as intimate as what we\u2019ve had this afternoon.\u201d \u201cA conversation?\u201d \u201cA conversation.\u201d INSIDE, JONES\u2019S mother-in-law slept on the couch, her iPad resting on her lap. Amelan worked at the dining table. Surrounded by family, Jones\u2019s current artistic dialogue with himself and his audience mines that territory. \u201cAnalogy\u201d comes from the Greek analogos, meaning \u201cproportional,\u201d with respect to a thing or person\u2019s share, allotment, lot. The importance of Dora\u2019s story, Jones has said, is that she lived through a time of unspeakable barbarity, which took the lives of her younger sister and numerous other family members, and yet she emerged free of cynicism and bitterness. \u201cI\u2019m bitter as hell yet about slavery,\u201d Jones said in a talk at Bard last year. \u201cI\u2019m really angry. I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019m always going to be angry. And here you have this woman, whose mother\u2019s side of her family were deported to Auschwitz,\u201d he said, speaking now as if his mother-in-law were there with us. \u201cHow dare you, Dora, come out of that war and say people are basically good?\u201d"]
["t-magazine", "The second part of \u201cAnalogy,\u201d which will debut at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., in July, is equally focused on family. Called \u201cLance: Pretty a.k.a. the Escape Artist,\u201d it explores the story of Jones\u2019s nephew Lance Briggs \u2014 a boy who wanted to grow up to be a combination of Michael Jackson and his famous uncle. He could sing like an angel, won scholarships to dance with the San Francisco Ballet and the Ailey School, and had begun a successful career as a model and performer and songwriter. But it all unraveled quickly. A life of promise became plagued by drug use and sexual exploitation. Addiction led to prostitution, and then AIDS, and then hospitalization for much of last year, and paraplegia and, at 45, a life closing in on death. \u201cWe say black lives matter,\u201d Jones told me. \u201cWell, this is a black life.\u201d Jones\u2019s sense of guilt at having failed to protect his nephew feels urgent, painful, pure. By telling Briggs\u2019s story, Jones initially hoped \u201cto jump-start the heart of an artist.\u201d In the months that have unfolded since I began to watch Jones work on \u201cLance,\u201d the story itself has changed. Lance was at last released from the hospital, where his uncle feared his life could end. Since the start of 2016, he has been collaborating with Jones, writing songs and raps for the production, as well as working on his own piece based on his life."]
["t-magazine", "To tell his \u201cAnalogy\u201d stories, Jones interviewed both Dora and Lance, setting down in type the events that he\u2019d heard from them throughout their lives. Rather than simply translating them into dance, Jones has included his interviews with his subjects in the pieces. We hear Jones\u2019s questions, and his subject\u2019s answers, typically voiced not by Jones himself, but by the dancers. \u201cNow, at this late hour in the game,\u201d Jones told me, \u201cto be the artist who I am and with the kind of notoriety or reputation that I have, and to be doing something very vulnerable and exposed like this, just a step away from the indulgence of publishing one\u2019s most intimate letters. ... But there\u2019s something about this device of these young anonymous people, that they are the channels for this hyper-personal discussion. That\u2019s my experiment.\u201d In other words, he is beginning to hand off control of the voice that has always been at the center of his work: his own. The change in method is a necessary evolution, if Jones\u2019s work is to outlive him, and it is, indeed, an experiment, what Jones is reaching for. But it is experimental in the way of the seeker, rather than the provocateur, more prayer than sermon. I\u2019VE BEEN WATCHING Jones develop this new work for the past year, as it has grown in length and form. As for Jones\u2019s early solo work, I know about it not because my 8-year-old self, living three blocks away, had the wherewithal to three-wheel-it over to Central Park in 1977. Rather, I know about it because Jones performed it for me at his house, after one of our lunches. He also performed another dance, called \u201c21,\u201d during our springlike November afternoon."]
["t-magazine", "\u201cWant to bring your pillow over?\u201d Jones said. Standing before me, on the weathered planks of his deck overlooking his manicured garden, Jones, in very worn wide-wale midnight-blue corduroys and a slate gray long-sleeved T-shirt, began to move. Jones has so often stripped his body bare or nearly as to make any reasonable human have to acknowledge its perfection, the act of its revelation less a brag or a dare than a statement of fact, as when the poet Christopher Logue, in his version of the \u201cIliad,\u201d describes the sound that Achilles\u2019s new armor made when it was first presented to him: \u201cMade in Heaven.\u201d As if to prove its perfection as an art object \u2014 Jones refers to his body as an \u201cinstrument\u201d \u2014 the painter Keith Haring once used Jones himself as a canvas, painting even his penis, five bright-white stripes on a fancy black sock. As Jones began to move, he adopted 21 different poses, each something to decode, each a manifestation of something pure, moving from one to the next, elementally, as water flows down a mountain, pooling here, pooling there. \u201cI used to trust my instrument,\u201d Jones had told me, earlier, \u201cso much that I could throw down anywhere.\u201d Point being, trust was gone; idea being, whatever this was, it wasn\u2019t throwing down. \u201cNow, you\u2019re seeing what\u2019s left of the old Billie Holiday. All you can hear is her phrasing,\u201d Jones said afterward. As his spectator, I\u2019d have to disagree."]
["t-magazine", "The first time he worked through the poses, he was silent. The second, the same poses were introduced by numbers, from one to 21. The third time, the numbers were replaced by names, captions that let us know where the poses had come from \u2014 \u201cOne, Italian Renaissance, contrapposto, David. Two, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Three, Muhammad Ali\u201d \u2014 each an icon, a stance a person could, in life, adopt. And then, as Jones began a fourth series through the movements, he began to collate the conversation we had been having into the dance, along with his passing thoughts, a stream of consciousness scissoring in of phrases said into the shapes he was adopting and discarding. What was most striking in these minutes was how his thoughts about his current project \u2014 about his nephew Briggs, who at that hour was lying paralyzed from the waist down in a Florida hospital bed \u2014 rose into the air, as Jones moved, with great tenderness, something achingly open and empty in the motions of his large calm hands. \u201cI ... I ... I ... I ...\u201d Jones now sang. \u201cDurer. \u2018The Expulsion,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said, as he adopted the pose of Adam expelled from Eden. \u201cGo. He has to go soon. Don\u2019t go to hell. Lance, do I want you to go?\u201d"]
["t-magazine", "It occurred to me, watching Jones move, that, like all great attempts at artistic expression, his art manages to model compassion for the spectator \u2014 to make us feel what it\u2019s like to be dealing with an intense feeling not our own, but one that becomes ours to deal with. When we add in the way in which Jones\u2019s mind and body are changing, the dances themselves take on a new sort of vulnerability, a new riskiness far from the formalism of the \u201970s. When performing \u201c21\u201d for his audience of one, Jones seemed less like a man intent upon confronting his audience than confronting himself. Watching him, I wondered where he got the strength to do all that looking. Before the last lunch I had with Amelan and Jones, inside now, Jones reached his right hand to his husband\u2019s left and his left to his guest\u2019s right. As we sat in silence, I recalled something Jones had said to me on an earlier visit when we were talking about his ambitions for \u201cLance.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to step out on the word \u2014 that term my mother speaks about, in her notion of the ecstatic nature of worship. \u2018Child, you have to step out on the word.\u2019 The word of God, she\u2019s talking about.\u201d Jones paused after he said it, wondering at it. \u201cWhat is my word?\u201d he asked, finally, as though that will always be the question."]

The original sample of land-line telephone exchanges from that earlier poll was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 69,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its share of all telephone numbers. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. To increase coverage, this land-line sample was supplemented by respondents reached through random dialing of cellphone numbers. The two samples were then combined and adjusted to assure the proper ratio of land-line-only, cellphone-only, and dual phone users. Interviewers made multiple efforts to reach every phone number in the survey, calling back unanswered numbers on different days at different times of both day and evening."]

In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, results based on such samples of all adults will differ by no more than 4 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all American adults.

["business", "F.D.A. Rejects Jet Lag Drug by Cephalon - The New York Times Air travelers for now may have to rely on coffee instead of a wonder drug to help them function in new time zones. Cephalon said  on Monday  that the Food and Drug Administration had declined to approve use of its  alertness drug, Nuvigil, to treat  jet lag. Had the drug been approved, it would have been the first prescription drug specifically designated for jet lag. Nuvigil is a slightly longer-lasting form of Cephalon\u2019s biggest seller, Provigil. Both drugs are approved to treat the excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, sleep apnea and shift work. In a statement, Cephalon did not elaborate about  why the F.D.A. had rejected  its application, other than to say that the agency had questioned the \u201crobustness\u201d of the results of questionnaires that asked participants in the company\u2019s clinical trial how sleepy they felt after taking the drug. The F.D.A., as a policy, does not comment on applications it does not approve. Millions of Americans who take long trips suffer from jet lag, in which the body\u2019s internal clock is out of sync with the time in one\u2019s location, leading people to feel sleepy when they need to be awake, or alert when they should be sleeping. Nuvigil was not intended to shift the body\u2019s clock to its new time zone, only to allow people to stay awake."]

Nuvigil, or armodafinil, had sales of $73.4 million in 2009 after reaching the market in June. Provigil is expected to face generic competition in 2012, so Cephalon is trying to shift as many patients as possible to the newer drug, which the company hopes will have a far longer patent life. Getting Nuvigil, but not Provigil, approved to treat jet lag was one element of that strategy. Cephalon\u2019s clinical trial involved 427 volunteers who were flown from the East Coast of the United States to France,  then kept in a sleep lab for three days. As measured by electrodes placed on the scalp, those who took Nuvigil were less sleepy during the French daytime than those who were given a placebo. In a more subjective test, in which participants were asked how sleepy they felt, the drug also did better than placebo, but not as convincingly. Cephalon\u2019s shares fell 4 percent in early after-hours trading after rising  3 percent in regular trading on Monday. In another development on Monday, a federal judge turned down Cephalon\u2019s request to dismiss antitrust lawsuits against the company filed by the Federal Trade Commission and various private parties. The Federal Trade Commission and the other plaintiffs said that Cephalon had paid generic drug companies to delay generic competition for Provigil until 2012.

["books", "\u2018The Vegetarian,\u2019 a Surreal South Korean Novel - The New York Times When Han Kang\u2019s surreal, violent novel \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d was published in South Korea nearly a decade ago, literary critics found it baffling. The story stars an unhinged heroine who believes she\u2019s turning into a tree, and features some of the strangest erotic passages in literature. (In one unforgettable scene, Ms. Han renders clich\u00e9d sexual metaphors about flowering plants and protruding pistils quite literally.) The mesmerizing mix of sex and violence was not what fans and reviewers expected from Ms. Han, a celebrated and award-winning poet and novelist. \u201cIt was received as very extreme and bizarre,\u201d Ms. Han said in English during a recent telephone interview from her home in Seoul. \u201cDefinitely, readers were surprised.\u201d Even more surprising was the rapturous reception that followed. \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d became a cult international best seller. Publication rights have sold in nearly 20 countries. It was adapted into a Korean film that played at Sundance in 2010. Still, Ms. Han, who has been publishing fiction and poetry for more than two decades, remained almost entirely unknown to English-speakers. That is starting to change, thanks largely to Deborah Smith, a 28-year-old British translator who read a Korean edition of \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d four years ago, when she was studying for her Ph.D. at the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies. She was transfixed by the unusual story and vivid, chiseled prose, and attempted to translate it herself, but wasn\u2019t fluent enough yet to capture Ms. Han\u2019s style. A year later, she tried again, and sent a short sample translation to a British publisher, who decided to publish the novel based on the first 10 pages."]
["books", "\u201cIt was very visual and painterly,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe reason that I wanted to translate her in the first place is that I think she is the best writer they have.\u201d It remains to be seen whether \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d which is being released in the United States this week by Hogarth, will resonate with American readers. But it is causing a stir in literary circles. The book has drawn a string of ecstatic early reviews, including those in Publishers Weekly, Booklist and Kirkus, which called it \u201cgracefully written and deeply disturbing.\u201d Independent booksellers are rallying around it. Literary novelists like Lauren Groff, Helen Oyeyemi and Eimear McBride have heaped praise on Ms. Han\u2019s hypnotic prose. \u201cEnthusiasm spread like a virus in the way that you always hope will happen,\u201d Molly Stern, the publisher of Hogarth, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that virus spreads into the reading public.\u201d The story centers on Yeong-hye, a melancholy housewife who is haunted by violent dreams that drive her to stop eating meat. Her abusive husband views her vegetarianism as an act of rebellion, while her brother-in-law becomes obsessed with her increasingly emaciated figure and her bluish birthmark, and lures her into performing in his sexually explicit video art. Like a cursed madwoman in classical myth, Yeong-hye seems both eerily prophetic and increasingly unhinged when she begins starving herself, hoping to transform into a tree. Ms. McBride, the author of \u201cA Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing,\u201d said she was struck by \u201cthe alignment of extraordinarily lyrical prose with incredibly brutal content.\u201d"]

While American publishers have become more willing to take risks on works in translation, particularly since the commercial success of international authors like Elena Ferrante, Karl Ove Knausgaard and Haruki Murakami, literary imports from South Korea remain scarce. Just a few prominent contemporary South Korean novelists have been published in the United States, including Young-ha Kim and Kyung-sook Shin. Some scholars, editors and translators say it is a shame that South Korea\u2019s vibrant and diverse literary culture has been largely overlooked by Western publishers, even as other Korean cultural exports like K-pop have spread across the globe. \u201cThere are so few works of Korean literature in translation, especially contemporary stuff,\u201d said Ed Park, a Korean-American novelist and executive editor at Penguin Press. More books are starting to trickle in. Three years ago, the independent publisher Dalkey Archive Press started its \u201cLibrary of Korean Literature\u201d series, a translation program financed in part by the Literature Translation Institute of Korea. Dalkey has published 19 translations so far, including contemporary novels and 20th-century classics, and will release six works of Korean fiction this year."]

The novel won Korea\u2019s Manhae Literary Prize last year, and Ms. Smith\u2019s English translation came out last month in Britain, where it was well received. Ms. Han was born in 1970 in Gwangju.

Her fascination with those contradictory impulses drives much of her fiction, and gave her the idea for \u201cThe Vegetarian.\u201d \u201cI was thinking about the spectrum of human behavior, from sublimity to horror, and wondered, is it really possible for humans to live a perfectly innocent life in this violent world, and what would happen if someone tried to achieve that?\u201d she said."]

["books/review", "Harper Lee\u2019s \u2018Go Set a Watchman\u2019 - The New York Times In 1992, a law professor named Monroe Freedman published an article in Legal Times, a magazine for practitioners. He asserted that Atticus Finch, the iconic hero of Harper Lee\u2019s novel \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d ought not be lauded as a role model for attorneys. Lee had portrayed Finch as zealously representing a black man, Tom Robinson, despite intense disapproval from many whites. What\u2019s more, Robinson was accused of having raped a white woman. Not only did Finch ably defend Robinson in court; one evening he also faced down a mob that sought to abduct the defendant from jail in order to lynch him. Generations have admired Finch for his fidelity to due process even at the risk of unpopularity and personal harm. Freedman noted, however, that Finch did not volunteer to represent Robinson; he did so only upon assignment by the court, saying that he had \u201choped to get through life without a case of this kind.\u201d Freedman also pointed out that Finch abstained from challenging the obvious illicit racial exclusion of blacks from the jury that wrongly convicted Robinson and the racial segregation in the courtroom itself, where blacks were confined to the balcony. At the time of this fictional trial, there would have been good strategic reasons for forgoing objection to these customs. Confrontation would have had little chance at success and a large likelihood of provoking retaliation against the defendant. In Freedman\u2019s view, however, those considerations were not decisive in influencing Atticus Finch. Rather, Freedman inferred that Finch failed to oppose Jim Crow custom because he was at home with it. He told his children that the Ku Klux Klan was merely \u201ca political organization\u201d and that the leader of the lynch mob was \u201cbasically a good man\u201d albeit with \u201cblind spots along with the rest of us.\u201d To Freedman, Finch\u2019s acts and omissions defined a lawyer who lived his life as a \u201cpassive participant\u201d in \u201cpervasive injustice.\u201d"]
["books/review", "This column by a legal academic, published in a relatively obscure trade journal, so enraged admirers of Atticus Finch that this newspaper published an article about the column and the impassioned responses it provoked. Dismissed by some as the ravings of a curmudgeon, Freedman\u2019s impression of Atticus Finch has now been largely ratified by none other than his creator, Harper Lee herself. The most dramatic feature of her \u201cnew\u201d novel, \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d \u2014 written before \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d but published 55 years afterward \u2014 is the revelation that Atticus, the supposed paragon of probity, courage and wisdom, was a white supremacist. In the mid-1930s, when the events of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d transpire, white dominance was so completely established that Finch could blithely disregard any political dissatisfactions blacks felt and still get credit from his adoring daughter \u2014 and from millions of readers \u2014 for defending an innocent man. Two decades later, when the events of \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d take place, white dominance has been shaken. Blacks are demanding the vote and attacking racial segregation. Finch\u2019s previous unflappable patrician calm now gives way to defensive anxiety. He defends segregationist propaganda with titles like \u201cThe Black Plague.\u201d He derides the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.), especially its lawyers. He rails against the prospect of blacks leaving their \u201cplace.\u201d \u201cDo you want Negroes by the carload in our schools and \u00adchurches and theaters?\u201d he asks his daughter, Jean Louise (also known affectionately as Scout). \u201cDo you want them in our world?\u201d He veers between expressing condescension \u2014 \u201cHoney, you do not seem to understand that the Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people\u201d \u2014 and expressing contempt: \u201cCan you blame the South for wanting to resist an invasion by people who are apparently so ashamed of their race they want to get rid of it?\u201d"]
["books/review", "The audience for these questions, Jean Louise, the grown-up Scout, is bereft of her beloved childhood companions. Jem, her brother, has suffered the fate of their mother: death at an early age from a sudden heart attack. Her mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley, is gone; and Dill, Scout and Jem\u2019s irrepressible summertime chum (a character modeled on Lee\u2019s longtime friend Truman Capote), is largely absent too. The most striking new presence is Henry Clinton, a hard-working young lawyer in Atticus\u2019s practice who hopes to marry Jean Louise. She appears to be on the verge of succumbing when she learns to her dismay that Henry, like Atticus, is a member of the Maycomb County Citizens\u2019 Council. Established in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education, White Citizens\u2019 Councils were tonier alternatives to the Klan. They were designed to be respectable organizations that would enable businessmen and professionals to thwart racial desegregation. Henry figures in two of the most memorable scenes in the novel. In one, he climbs a water tower to save Jean Louise. Still ignorant about sex as a sixth grader, she believes she is pregnant because a boy at school put his tongue in her mouth. She considers jumping off the water tower to commit suicide to spare her family disgrace. In another scene, Henry escorts Jean Louise to the high school prom. She is wearing falsies that stray. \u201cHer right false bosom was in the center of her chest, and the other was nearly under her left armpit.\u201d He hugs her close to prevent others from seeing what has happened, comforts her outside of the school gymnasium, and throws the falsies away. When they land on a sign honoring students who have joined the armed forces after graduation, the school\u2019s outraged principal demands that the guilty party turn herself in. Henry, with Atticus\u2019s counsel, concocts a scheme in which each of the girls at the school writes a note saying the offending falsies look like her own, ensuring that no one bears the full weight of the principal\u2019s anger."]
["books/review", "Although \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d sporadically generates the literary force that has buoyed \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d for over half a century, the new novel is not nearly as gripping as the courtroom drama and coming-of-age story it eventually became. The first hundred pages are largely desultory, though they do create a sense of anticipation. Then Lee begins to introduce the reader to Jean Louise\u2019s discovery that Atticus and Henry have joined the White Citizens\u2019 Council. Her disappointment, which develops into anger, suggests an opportunity to explore a dense, rich, complicated subject: How should you deal with someone who has loved you unstintingly when you find out that this same person harbors ugly, dangerous social prejudices? Unfortunately, Lee\u2019s response is uninspired. In an ending that is all too compressed, she portrays Jean Louise as teetering between a moral revulsion that makes her love for Atticus and Henry impossible and an acceptance of the men despite their racism. Lee\u2019s rendering of Jean Louise\u2019s ambivalence is undeveloped. One yearns for a narrative that conveys the contending emotions with vividness and detail, as the heroine grapples with the intricacies of the problem: Is it wrong to revoke affection because of disgust with the ideology of someone who has nurtured you all your life? Is it intolerably dictatorial to impose a political litmus test on loved ones? Is it complacent to refuse to? If morality compels censuring the retrograde beliefs and conduct of lovers, friends and family, how should that be done? And then what?"]
["books/review", "Alas, in \u201cGo Set a Watchman,\u201d the reader is given only a sketch in which Jean Louise is hurriedly made to try on one reaction and then another without earned resolution or depth. Would it have been better for this earlier novel to have remained unpublished? Though it does not represent Harper Lee\u2019s best work, it does reveal more starkly the complexity of Atticus Finch, her most admired character. \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d demands that its readers abandon the immature sentimentality ingrained by middle school lessons about the nobility of the white savior and the mesmerizing performance of Gregory Peck in the film adaptation of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d But the conversation doesn\u2019t end with Monroe Freedman\u2019s complaint about Atticus Finch\u2019s limitations or with Jean Louise\u2019s disillusionment with her previously idolized father. After Lee sold the manuscript we\u2019re now reading, she worked hard on revisions. At her editor\u2019s urging, she shifted the novel\u2019s time frame from the 1950s to the Depression, away from the messy adult problems of a young woman coming to understand the racism of her father, and back to childhood, where seen through Scout\u2019s eyes, Atticus Finch could become the hero that millions of readers love. The editor\u2019s shrewd suggestion belonged to a specific time and place, too. In America in 1960, the story of a decent white Southerner who defends an innocent black man charged with raping a white woman had the appeal of a fairy tale and the makings of a popular movie. Perhaps even more promising, though, was the novel Lee first envisioned, the story of Jean Louise\u2019s adult conflicts between love and fairness, decency and loyalty.

Last week, Collins, 35, played in his first games since announcing in 2013 that he was gay. No other publicly gay player had ever appeared in an N.B.A. game. Given the support he heard all last week, playing four games on the road with the Nets, it seems likely that he will receive a hero\u2019s welcome at Barclays Center. \u201cThey all will support a Net,\u201d Coach Jason Kidd said about the home fans. \u201cHe\u2019s been a Net before, and I think they\u2019ll be excited to have him.\u201d The homecoming for Collins, who spent the first six and a half seasons of his career with the Nets when they played in New Jersey, will extend a surreal span of days. He signed the contract last Sunday and was thrown into a game a few hours later against the Los Angeles Lakers. It was his first game in more than 10 months. As the week went on, Collins was inundated with support, including texted congratulations from Billie Jean King. His No. 98 jersey became the top seller on the league\u2019s online store. He spoke to packs of reporters in every city the Nets visited."]
["sports/basketball", "Over the last week, Collins has needed to straddle dual impulses, acknowledging and appreciating the huge positive response he has received while stressing that his focus will be on playing basketball, that he wants to be known as a basketball player rather than a social crusader. Even so, his presence on the court has carried an unmistakable significance as professional sports in North America have struggled to create work environments that are perceived as welcoming to gay athletes. It has seemed a small but noteworthy happenstance, as well, that Brooklyn has once again become the home base and backdrop for a pioneering change in professional sports. It was on opening day at Ebbets Field in 1947 that Jackie Robinson became modern major league baseball\u2019s first black player. Jonathan Eig, the author of \u201cOpening Day: The Story of Jackie Robinson\u2019s First Season,\u201d said Robinson\u2019s debut occurred in a rather lukewarm atmosphere. \u201cThe word I would use to describe Brooklyn\u2019s immediate reaction is ambivalence,\u201d he said. Eig said there was palpable excitement among black fans, who came out in big numbers to support Robinson on opening day. But the predominant sentiment among white fans seemed to be hesitance and uncertainty. Attendance at Ebbets Field that first game was lower than normal, Eig said, which many at the time attributed to a sense of unease among white fans about what the environment at the stadium might be."]
["sports/basketball", "Still, Brooklyn then and now represents a fitting landscape for such a narrative to play out. Demographics have drastically changed, but the borough was known 60 years ago, as it is now, as a dense and diverse melting pot, Eig said. The two stories are considerably different, but they align in one key aspect. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Eig said about Collins\u2019s presence on the court, \u201cjust as it was long overdue for baseball to integrate racially.\u201d Robinson garnered some additional news media attention, particularly from the black press, Eig said, though he added that many white reporters left him alone as they lacked the empathy to discuss what he was going through. Robinson believed his actions and play would do far more than talking to change people\u2019s attitudes about race, so he focused on what he could control on the field. Collins has adopted a similar position while standing inside the media scrums. On the court, he has done his job \u2014 minor one that it is. Through his first four games, he is averaging 8.5 minutes and one rebound per game. He has earned praise from his coach and teammates for the less tangible contributions he makes. He has restored to the Nets a hard edge. He can still set a punishing screen. He is a tactical fouler. Collins\u2019s 10-day deal expires on Wednesday, though it seems inconceivable that the Nets would not keep him on the roster. Teams can sign a player to two 10-day contracts in a season. After that, they must issue a contract for the remainder of the season or let the player become a free agent."]

["world/asia", "U.S. Exploring Deal to Limit Pakistan\u2019s Nuclear Arsenal - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014  The Obama administration is exploring a deal with Pakistan that would limit the scope of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the fastest-growing on Earth. The talks are the first in the decade since one of the founders of its nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, was caught selling the country\u2019s nuclear technology around the world. The talks are being held in advance of the arrival of Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in Washington next week. They focus on American concern that Pakistan might be on the verge of deploying a small tactical nuclear weapon \u2014 explicitly modeled on weapons the United States put in Europe during the Cold War to deter a Soviet invasion \u2014 that would be far harder to secure than the country\u2019s arsenal of larger weapons. But outside experts familiar with the discussions, which have echoes of the Obama administration\u2019s first approaches to Iran on its nuclear program three years ago, expressed deep skepticism that Pakistan is ready to put limits on a program that is the pride of the nation, and that it regards as its only real defense against India. The discussions are being led by Peter R. Lavoy, a longtime intelligence expert on the Pakistani program who is now on the staff of the National Security Council. At the White House on Thursday, Josh Earnest, the press secretary, was asked about the talks and broke from the administration\u2019s previous position of refusing to comment."]
["world/asia", "\u201cA deal like the one that\u2019s been discussed publicly is not something that\u2019s likely to come to fruition next week,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the United States and Pakistan are regularly engaged in a dialogue about the importance of nuclear security. And I would anticipate that that dialogue would include conversations between the leaders of our two countries.\u201d The central element of the proposal, according to other officials and outside experts, would be a relaxation of strict controls put on Pakistan by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a loose affiliation of nations that tries to control the proliferation of weapons. \u201cIf Pakistan would take the actions requested by the United States, it would essentially amount to recognition of rehabilitation and would essentially amount to parole,\u201d said George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has maintained contacts with the Pakistani nuclear establishment. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth a try,\u201d Mr. Perkovich said. \u201cBut I have my doubts that the Pakistanis are capable of doing this.\u201d David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post, first disclosed the exploratory talks in a column a week ago. Since then, several other officials and outside experts have talked in more detail about the effort, although the White House has refused to comment. The activity of Mr. Khan, who lives in retirement in a comfortable neighborhood in Islamabad after many years of house arrest, prompted more than a decade of American-led punishment of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear enterprises. He ran what amounted to the world\u2019s most sophisticated black market in the equipment needed to make nuclear fuel, and he did business with Iran, North Korea and Libya."]
["world/asia", "When Libya turned over the equipment it bought, in late 2003, it included a nearly complete design for one of China\u2019s first nuclear weapons. Pakistani officials denied that any of the country\u2019s leaders knew of Mr. Khan\u2019s black market activities, a story American officials did not believe because some of the equipment was shipped on Pakistani Air Force cargo planes. While Mr. Khan is not under formal restrictions today, he has not left Pakistan in years and has been prohibited from talking to most outsiders. Even before entering office, President Obama was interested in addressing the Pakistani nuclear problem, considered by most proliferation experts to be the most dangerous in the world. But until now, most efforts to manage the problem have been covert. During the Bush administration, the United States spent as much as $100 million on a highly classified program to help secure the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal, helping with physical security and the training of Pakistani security personnel. Those efforts continued in the Obama years, with State Department, Energy Department and intelligence officials meeting secretly, in locales around the world, with senior Pakistani officials from the Strategic Plans Division, which controls the arsenal. They used those sessions to argue to the Pakistanis that fielding the small, short-range nuclear weapons, which Pakistan designed to use against an invading Indian ground force, would be highly risky."]
["world/asia", "American officials have told Congress they are increasingly convinced that most of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal is under good safeguards, with warheads separated from delivery vehicles and a series of measures in place to guard against unauthorized use. But they fear the smaller weapons are easier to steal, or would be easier to use should they fall into the hands of a rogue commander. \u201cAll it takes is one commander with secret radical sympathies, and you have a big problem,\u201d said one former official who dealt with the issue. The message appears to have resonated; an unknown number of the tactical weapons were built, but not deployed. It is that problem that Mr. Lavoy and others are trying to forestall, along with preventing Pakistan from deploying some long-range missiles that could reach well beyond India. But American leverage has been hard to find. Unlike Iran, Pakistan never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the international agreement that prohibits nations, except for existing declared nuclear states like the United States, from possessing a nuclear arsenal. Pakistan is not alone in that distinction: India and Israel also have not signed. (North Korea has twice declared that it has withdrawn from the treaty, in 1993 and 2003.) Ordinarily, any country\u2019s refusal to sign the treaty would preclude American nuclear cooperation. So Pakistani officials remain angry with the American decision to enter an agreement with India in 2005 allowing India to buy civil nuclear technology, even though it remains outside the treaty and put no limits on its nuclear program."]
["world/asia", "Under that agreement, India\u2019s nuclear infrastructure was split with a civilian program that is under international inspection, and a military program that is not. Pakistani officials have demanded the same arrangement. That does not appear to be on the table. Instead, the United States is exploring ways to relax restrictions on nuclear-related technology to Pakistan, perhaps with a long-term goal of allowing the country to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which regulates the sale of the technology. That would be largely symbolic: Pakistan manages to import or make what it needs for its nuclear arsenal, and China has already broken ground on a $9.6 billion nuclear power complex in Karachi. Mr. Sharif presided over the ceremony."]
["world/asia", "C.I.A. Delivers Cash to Afghan Leader\u2019s Office - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 For more than a decade, wads of American dollars packed into suitcases, backpacks and, on occasion, plastic shopping bags have been dropped off every month or so at the offices of Afghanistan\u2019s president \u2014 courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency. All told, tens of millions of dollars have flowed from the C.I.A. to the office of President Hamid Karzai, according to current and former advisers to the Afghan leader. \u201cWe called it \u2018ghost money,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Khalil Roman, who served as Mr. Karzai\u2019s deputy chief of staff from 2002 until 2005. \u201cIt came in secret, and it left in secret.\u201d The C.I.A., which declined to comment for this article, has long been known to support some relatives and close aides of Mr. Karzai. But the new accounts of off-the-books cash delivered directly to his office show payments on a vaster scale, and with a far greater impact on everyday governing. Moreover, there is little evidence that the payments bought the influence the C.I.A. sought. Instead, some American officials said, the cash has fueled corruption and empowered warlords, undermining Washington\u2019s exit strategy from Afghanistan. \u201cThe biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan,\u201d one American official said, \u201cwas the United States.\u201d The United States was not alone in delivering cash to the president. Mr. Karzai acknowledged a few years ago that Iran regularly gave bags of cash to one of his top aides."]
["world/asia", "At the time, in 2010, American officials jumped on the payments as evidence of an aggressive Iranian campaign to buy influence and poison Afghanistan\u2019s relations with the United States. What they did not say was that the C.I.A. was also plying the presidential palace with cash \u2014 and unlike the Iranians, it still is. American and Afghan officials familiar with the payments said the agency\u2019s main goal in providing the cash has been to maintain access to Mr. Karzai and his inner circle and to guarantee the agency\u2019s influence at the presidential palace, which wields tremendous power in Afghanistan\u2019s highly centralized government. The officials spoke about the money only on the condition of anonymity. It is not clear that the United States is getting what it pays for. Mr. Karzai\u2019s willingness to defy the United States \u2014 and the Iranians, for that matter \u2014 on an array of issues seems to have only grown as the cash has piled up. Instead of securing his good graces, the payments may well illustrate the opposite: Mr. Karzai is seemingly unable to be bought. Over Iran\u2019s objections, he signed a strategic partnership deal with the United States last year, directly leading the Iranians to halt their payments, two senior Afghan officials said. Now, Mr. Karzai is seeking control over the Afghan militias raised by the C.I.A. to target operatives of Al Qaeda and insurgent commanders, potentially upending a critical part of the Obama administration\u2019s plans for fighting militants as conventional military forces pull back this year."]
["world/asia", "But the C.I.A. has continued to pay, believing it needs Mr. Karzai\u2019s ear to run its clandestine war against Al Qaeda and its allies, according to American and Afghan officials. Like the Iranian cash, much of the C.I.A.\u2019s money goes to paying off warlords and politicians, many of whom have ties to the drug trade and, in some cases, the Taliban. The result, American and Afghan officials said, is that the agency has greased the wheels of the same patronage networks that American diplomats and law enforcement agents have struggled unsuccessfully to dismantle, leaving the government in the grips of what are basically organized crime syndicates. The cash does not appear to be subject to the oversight and restrictions placed on official American aid to the country or even the C.I.A.\u2019s formal assistance programs, like financing Afghan intelligence agencies. And while there is no evidence that Mr. Karzai has personally taken any of the money \u2014 Afghan officials say the cash is handled by his National Security Council \u2014 the payments do in some cases work directly at odds with the aims of other parts of the American government in Afghanistan, even if they do not appear to violate American law. Handing out cash has been standard procedure for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan since the start of the war. During the 2001 invasion, agency cash bought the services of numerous warlords, including Muhammad Qasim Fahim, the current first vice president. \u201cWe paid them to overthrow the Taliban,\u201d the American official said."]
["world/asia", "The C.I.A. then kept paying the Afghans to keep fighting. For instance, Mr. Karzai\u2019s half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, was paid by the C.I.A. to run the Kandahar Strike Force, a militia used by the agency to combat militants, until his assassination in 2011. A number of senior officials on the Afghan National Security Council are also individually on the agency\u2019s payroll, Afghan officials said. While intelligence agencies often pay foreign officials to provide information, dropping off bags of cash at a foreign leader\u2019s office to curry favor is a more unusual arrangement. Afghan officials said the practice grew out of the unique circumstances in Afghanistan, where the United States built the government that Mr. Karzai runs. To accomplish that task, it had to bring to heel many of the warlords the C.I.A. had paid during and after the 2001 invasion. By late 2002, Mr. Karzai and his aides were pressing for the payments to be routed through the president\u2019s office, allowing him to buy the warlords\u2019 loyalty, a former adviser to Mr. Karzai said. Then, in December 2002, Iranians showed up at the palace in a sport utility vehicle packed with cash, the former adviser said. The C.I.A. began dropping off cash at the palace the following month, and the sums grew from there, Afghan officials said. Payments ordinarily range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, the officials said, though none could provide exact figures. The money is used to cover a slew of off-the-books expenses, like paying off lawmakers or underwriting delicate diplomatic trips or informal negotiations."]
["world/asia", "Much of it also still goes to keeping old warlords in line. One is Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek whose militia served as a C.I.A. proxy force in 2001. He receives nearly $100,000 a month from the palace, two Afghan officials said. Other officials said the amount was significantly lower. Mr. Dostum, who declined requests for comment, had previously said he was given $80,000 a month to serve as Mr. Karzai\u2019s emissary in northern Afghanistan. \u201cI asked for a year up front in cash so that I could build my dream house,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a 2009 interview  with Time magazine. Some of the cash also probably ends up in the pockets of the Karzai aides who handle it, Afghan and Western officials said, though they would not identify any by name. That is not a significant concern for the C.I.A., said American officials familiar with the agency\u2019s operations. \u201cThey\u2019ll work with criminals if they think they have to,\u201d one American former official said. Interestingly, the cash from Tehran appears to have been handled with greater transparency than the dollars from the C.I.A., Afghan officials said. The Iranian payments were routed through Mr. Karzai\u2019s chief of staff. Some of the money was deposited in an account in the president\u2019s name at a state-run bank, and some was kept at the palace. The sum delivered would then be announced at the next cabinet meeting. The Iranians gave $3 million to well over $10 million a year, Afghan officials said."]
["world/asia", "When word of the Iranian cash leaked out in October 2010, Mr. Karzai told reporters that he was grateful for it. He then added: \u201cThe United States is doing the same thing. They are providing cash to some of our offices.\u201d At the time, Mr. Karzai\u2019s aides said he was referring to the billions in formal aid the United States gives. But the former adviser said in a recent interview that the president was in fact referring to the C.I.A.\u2019s bags of cash. No one mentions the agency\u2019s money at cabinet meetings. It is handled by a small clique at the National Security Council, including its administrative chief, Mohammed Zia Salehi, Afghan officials said. Mr. Salehi, though, is better known for being arrested in 2010 in connection with a sprawling, American-led investigation that tied together Afghan cash smuggling, Taliban finances and the opium trade.

["arts/international", "Frieze New York Expands on Its Successful Model - The New York Times In its fourth edition, the art fair Frieze New York will be making a few subtle tweaks to its highly successful formula. Frieze New York, a sibling event to the Frieze London fair that happens in October, will gather some 190 galleries from 33 territories in Randall\u2019s Island Park from May 14 to May 17. The fair has quickly gained elite status among the world\u2019s art fairs not only by corralling the top galleries, but also by focusing on creating a more enjoyable visitor experience. Food service from local restaurants with a cult following has been one part of the Frieze New York lineup. This year, Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream and the California-style cafe Dimes are two new names joining stalwarts like Roberta\u2019s, the extremely popular Brooklyn restaurant and pizzeria. \u201cWe started with this idea of the fair as a meeting place,\u201d said Amanda Sharp, who co-founded both editions of Frieze with Matthew Slotover. \u201cOne of the great things is to break bread with people.\u201d Perhaps most distinct is the venue itself \u2014 a serpentine white tent with a translucent vinyl roof \u2014 and its location far off the beaten path. \u201cThe light is so amazing in the tent,\u201d said the New York dealer Alexander Gray, who has participated since the beginning. \u201cThere\u2019s something uplifting about it. It\u2019s the only fair where you know what time of day it is.\u201d"]
["arts/international", "A large portion of visitors take a ferry from Manhattan to Randall\u2019s Island, adding to the unique quality. \u201cBecause it requires a journey to get there, people stay,\u201d said Mr. Gray, who this year will be showing paintings by the New Mexico\u2013based painter Harmony Hammond. A new section, \u201cSpotlight,\u201d includes 16 galleries. \u201cIt looks at great, overlooked works from the 20th century,\u201d Ms. Sharp said. As part of Spotlight, London\u2019s Vigo Gallery will show work by the Sudanese artist and diplomat Ibrahim El-Salahi. In the fair\u2019s main section, some big-name dealers will be participating for the first time: Acquavella, Matthew Marks and Pace Gallery. The well-known newcomers \u201cwill be bringing more blue-chip material than we\u2019ve seen in the past, more historical material than we\u2019ve had in the past,\u201d Ms. Sharp said. Those additions are good not only for buyers of brand-name art, but also for the way they bring balance to the fair in ways that are not obvious to visitors, Ms. Sharp said. Essentially the more established galleries help subsidize two of the fair\u2019s sections, Focus and Frame, both devoted to younger, smaller galleries that pay half the regular price to participate. Each section has a gallery from Asia, a region not heavily represented at the fair. Frame, for galleries less than eight years old that are presenting solo shows, includes a booth for Shanghai\u2019s Antenna Space. Focus, for galleries founded in or after 2003, features Chi-Wen Gallery of Taipei, Taiwan."]

One of the Frieze Sounds entries, \u201cGrosses C\u201d by Alicja Kwade, is an audio collage of moments on film when characters react to seeing a diamond for the first time. The trend at all art fairs has been moving away from showing a smorgasbord of unrelated works by different artists to presenting more streamlined booths, and that continues for the local galleries showing their wares in this edition. About a third of the galleries are from New York. \u201cFrieze is in our home city,\u201d said Greg Lulay, a director of David Zwirner Gallery in New York. \u201cWe approach it like an additional exhibition here.

It\u2019s easy to misunderstand the self as private, when it\u2019s rarely private at all: It\u2019s always a public artifact, never fixed, perpetually sculpted by social forces. In truth, I was proud to describe myself in terms of sadness rather than anger. Why? Sadness seemed more refined and also more selfless \u2014 as if you were holding the pain inside yourself, rather than making someone else deal with its blunt-force trauma. But a few years ago, I started to get a knot in my gut at the canned cadences of my own refrain: I don\u2019t get angry. I get sad. At the shrillest moments of our own self-declarations \u2014 I am X, I am not Y \u2014 we often hear in that tinny register another truth, lurking expectantly, and begin to realize there are things about ourselves we don\u2019t yet know.

Of course it wasn\u2019t anger when, during a faculty meeting early in my teaching days, I distributed statistics about how many female students in our department had reported instances of sexual harassment the year before: more than half of them. A faculty member grew indignant and insisted that most of those claims probably didn\u2019t have any basis at all. I clenched my fists. I struggled to speak.

["magazine", "The phenomenon of female anger has often been turned against itself, the figure of the angry woman reframed as threat \u2014 not the one who has been harmed, but the one bent on harming. She conjures a lineage of threatening archetypes: the harpy and her talons, the witch and her spells, the medusa and her writhing locks. The notion that female anger is unnatural or destructive is learned young; children report perceiving displays of anger as more acceptable from boys than from girls. According to a review of studies of gender and anger written in 2000 by Ann M. Kring, a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, men and women self-report \u201canger episodes\u201d with comparable degrees of frequency, but women report experiencing more shame and embarrassment in their aftermath. People are more likely to use words like \u201cbitchy\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d to describe female anger, while male anger is more likely to be described as \u201cstrong.\u201d Kring reported that men are more likely to express their anger by physically assaulting objects or verbally attacking other people, while women are more likely to cry when they get angry, as if their bodies are forcibly returning them to the appearance of the emotion \u2014 sadness \u2014 with which they are most commonly associated."]
["magazine", "A 2016 study found that it took longer for people to correctly identify the gender of female faces displaying an angry expression, as if the emotion had wandered out of its natural habitat by finding its way to their features.

["magazine", "If an angry woman makes people uneasy, then her more palatable counterpart, the sad woman, summons sympathy more readily. She often looks beautiful in her suffering: ennobled, transfigured, elegant. Angry women are messier. Their pain threatens to cause more collateral damage. It\u2019s as if the prospect of a woman\u2019s anger harming other people threatens to rob her of the social capital she has gained by being wronged. We are most comfortable with female anger when it promises to regulate itself, to refrain from recklessness, to stay civilized. Consider the red-carpet clip of Uma Thurman that went viral in November, during the initial swell of sexual-harassment accusations. The clip doesn\u2019t actually show Thurman\u2019s getting angry. It shows her very conspicuously refusing to get angry. After commending the Hollywood women who had spoken out about their experiences of sexual assault, she said that she was \u201cwaiting to feel less angry\u201d before she spoke herself. It was curious that Thurman\u2019s public declarations were lauded as a triumphant vision of female anger, because the clip offered precisely the version of female anger that we\u2019ve long been socialized to produce and accept: not the spectacle of female anger unleashed, but the spectacle of female anger restrained, sharpened to a photogenic point. By withholding the specific story of whatever made her angry, Thurman made her anger itself the story \u2014 and the raw force of her struggle not to get angry on that red carpet summoned the force of her anger even more powerfully than its full explosion would have, just as the monster in a movie is most frightening when it only appears offscreen."]

Why were they even vexed? It seemed a failure of moral sentiment or a betrayal of feminism, as if I were somehow siding with the patriarchy, or had internalized it so thoroughly I couldn\u2019t even spot the edges of its toxic residue. I intuitively embraced and supported other women\u2019s anger but struggled to claim my own. Some of this had to do with the ways I\u2019d been lucky \u2014 I had experienced all kinds of gendered aggression, but nothing equivalent to the horror stories so many other women have lived through. But it also had to do with an abiding aversion to anger that still festered like rot inside me. In what I had always understood as self-awareness \u2014 I don\u2019t get angry.

I was obsessed with her own obsession with her own blood (\u201cWhat a thrill ... that red plush\u201d) and drawn to her suffering silhouette: a woman abandoned by her cheating husband and ensnared by the gendered double standards of domesticity.

["magazine", "I kept returning to the early novels of Jean Rhys, whose wounded heroines flopped around dingy rented rooms in various European capitals, seeking solace from their heartbreak, staining cheap comforters with their wine. Sasha, the heroine of \u201cGood Morning, Midnight\u201d \u2014 the most famous of these early picaresques of pain \u2014 resolves to drink herself to death and manages, mainly, to cry her way across Paris. She cries at cafes, at bars, in her lousy hotel room. She cries at work. She cries in a fitting room. She cries on the street. She cries near the Seine. The closing scene of the novel is a scene of terrifying passivity: She lets a wraithlike man into her bed because she can\u2019t summon the energy to stop him, as if she has finally lost touch with her willpower entirely. In life, Rhys was infamous for her sadness, what one friend called \u201cher gramophone-needle-stuck-in-a-groove thing of going over and over miseries of one sort and another.\u201d Even her biographer called her one of the greatest self-pity artists in the history of English fiction. It took me years to understand how deeply I had misunderstood these women. I\u2019d missed the rage that fueled Plath\u2019s poetry like a ferocious gasoline, lifting her speakers (sometimes literally) into flight: \u201cNow she is flying/More terrible than she ever was, red/Scar in the sky, red comet/Over the engine that killed her \u2014 the mausoleum, the wax house.\u201d The speaker becomes a scar \u2014 this irrefutable evidence of her own pain \u2014 but this scar, in turn, becomes a comet: terrible and determined, soaring triumphant over the instruments of her own supposed destruction. I\u2019d always been preoccupied with the pained disintegration of Plath\u2019s speakers, but once I started looking, I saw the comet trails of their angry resurrections everywhere, delivering their unapologetic fantasies of retribution: \u201cOut of the ash/I rise with my red hair/And I eat men like air.\u201d"]

In this late masterpiece, the heroines of Rhys\u2019s early novels \u2014 heartbroken, drunk, caught in complicated choreographies of passivity \u2014 are replaced by an angry woman with a torch, ready to use the master\u2019s tools to destroy his house. It wasn\u2019t that these authors were writing exclusively about female anger rather than female sorrow; their writing holds both states of feeling. \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d excavates the deep veins of sadness running beneath an otherwise opaque act of angry destruction, and Plath\u2019s poems are invested in articulating the complicated affective braids of bitterness, irony, anger, pride and sorrow that others often misread as monolithic sadness. \u201cThey explain people like that by saying that their minds are in watertight compartments, but it never seemed so to me,\u201d Rhys herself once wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all washing about, like the bilge in the hold of a ship.\u201d"]
["magazine", "It has always been easier to shunt female sadness and female anger into the \u201cwatertight compartments\u201d of opposing archetypes, rather than acknowledging the ways they run together in the cargo hold of every female psyche. Near the end of the new biopic \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d Tonya Harding\u2019s character explains: \u201cAmerica, they want someone to love, but they want someone to hate.\u201d The timing of the film\u2019s release, in late 2017, seemed cosmically apt. It resurrected a definitional prototype of female anger \u2014 at least for many women like me, who came of age during the 1990s \u2014 at the precise moment that so many women were starting to get publicly, explicitly, unapologetically angry. Harding was an object of fascination not just because of the soap opera she dangled before the public gaze \u2014 supposedly conspiring with her ex-husband and an associate to plan an attack on her rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan \u2014 but also because she and Kerrigan provided a yin and yang of primal female archetypes. As a vision of anger \u2014 uncouth and unrestrained, the woman everyone loved to hate, exploding at the judges when they didn\u2019t give her the scores she felt she deserved \u2014 Harding was the perfect foil for the elegant suffering of Kerrigan, sobbing in her lacy white leotard. Together they were an impossible duo to turn away from: the sad girl and the mad girl. Wounded and wicked. Their binary segregated one vision of femininity we adored (rule-abiding, delicate, hurting) from another we despised (trashy, whiny, angry). Harding was strong; she was poor; she was pissed off; and eventually, in the narrative embraced by the public, she turned those feelings into violence. But \u201cI, Tonya\u201d illuminates what so little press coverage at the time paid attention to: the perfect storm of violence that produced Harding\u2019s anger in the first place \u2014 her mother\u2019s abuse and her husband\u2019s. Which is to say: No woman\u2019s anger is an island."]
["magazine", "When the Harding and Kerrigan controversy swept the media, I was 10 years old. Their story was imprinted onto me as a series of reductive but indelible brush strokes: one woman shouting at the media, another woman weeping just beyond the ice rink. But after watching \u201cI, Tonya\u201d and realizing how much these two women had existed to me as ideas, rather than as women, I did what any reasonable person would do: I Googled \u201cTonya and Nancy\u201d obsessively. I Googled: \u201cDid Tonya ever apologize to Nancy?\u201d I Googled: \u201cTonya Harding boxing career?\u201d and discovered that it effectively began with her 2002 \u201cCelebrity Boxing\u201d match against Paula Jones \u2014 two women paid to perform the absurd caricatures of vengeful femininity the public had projected onto them, the woman who cried harassment versus the woman who bashed kneecaps. In the documentaries I watched, I found Harding difficult to like. She comes off as a self-deluded liar with a robust victim complex, focused on her own misfortune to the exclusion of anyone else\u2019s. But what does the fact that I found Harding \u201cdifficult to like\u201d say about the kind of women I\u2019m comfortable liking? Did I want the plotline in which the woman who has survived her own hard life \u2014 abusive mother, abusive husband, enduring poverty \u2014 also emerges with a \u201clikable\u201d personality: a plucky spirit, a determined work ethic and a graceful, self-effacing relationship to her own suffering?"]
["magazine", "The vision of Harding in \u201cI, Tonya\u201d is something close to the opposite of self-effacing. The film even includes a fantastical re-enactment of the crime, which became popularly known as the \u201cwhack heard round the world,\u201d in which Harding stands over Kerrigan\u2019s cowering body, baton raised high above her head, striking her bloody knee until Harding turns back toward the camera \u2014 her face defiant and splattered with Kerrigan\u2019s blood. Even though the attack was actually carried out by a hired hit man, this imagined scene distills the version of the story that America became obsessed with, in which one woman\u2019s anger leaves another woman traumatized. But America\u2019s obsession with these two women wasn\u2019t that simple. There was another story that rose up in opposition. In this shadow story, Harding wasn\u2019t a monster but a victim, an underdog unfairly vilified, and Kerrigan was a crybaby who made too much of her pain. In a 2014 Deadspin essay, \u201cConfessions of a Tonya Harding Apologist,\u201d Lucy Madison wrote: \u201cShe represented the fulfillment of an adolescent revenge fantasy \u2014 my adolescent revenge fantasy, the one where the girl who doesn\u2019t quite fit in manages to soar over everyone\u2019s [expletive] without giving up a fraction of her prerogative \u2014 and I could not have loved her more.\u201d When Kerrigan crouched sobbing on the floor near the training rink, right after the attack (Newsweek described it as \u201cthe sound of one dream breaking\u201d), she famously cried out: \u201cWhy? Why? Why?\u201d But when Newsweek ran the story on its cover, it printed the quote as: \u201cWhy Me?\u201d The single added word turned her shock into keening self-pity."]
["magazine", "These two seemingly contradictory versions of Harding and Kerrigan \u2014 raging bitch and innocent victim, or bad-girl hero and whiny crybaby \u2014 offered the same cutout dolls dressed in different costumes. The entitled weeper was the unacceptable version of a stoic victim; the scrappy underdog was the acceptable version of a raging bitch. At first glance, they seemed like opposite stories, betraying our conflicted collective relationship to female anger \u2014 that it\u2019s either heroic or uncontrollably destructive \u2014 and our love-hate relationship with victimhood itself: We love a victim to hurt for but grow irritated by one who hurts too much. Both stories, however, insisted upon the same segregation: A woman couldn\u2019t hurt and be hurt at once. She could be either angry or sad. It was easier to outsource those emotions to the bodies of separate women than it was to acknowledge that they reside together in the body of every woman. Ten years ago in Nicaragua, a man punched me in the face on a dark street.

Maybe 20 minutes later, a police vehicle pulled up: a pickup truck outfitted with a barred cage in the back. There was a man in the cage."]
["magazine", "\u201cIs this him?\u201d the cop asked. I shook my head, horrified, acutely aware of my own power \u2014 realizing, in that moment, that simply saying I was hurt could take away a stranger\u2019s liberty. I was a white woman, a foreigner volunteering at a local school, and I felt ashamed of my own familiar silhouette: a vulnerable white woman crying danger at anonymous men lurking in the shadows. I felt scared and embarrassed to be scared. I felt embarrassed that everyone was making such a fuss. One thing I did not feel was anger. That night, my sense of guilt \u2014 my shame at being someone deemed worthy of protection, and at the ways that protection might endanger others \u2014 effectively blocked my awareness of my own anger. It was as if my privilege outweighed my vulnerability, and that meant I wasn\u2019t entitled to any anger at all. But if I struggled to feel entitled to anger that night in Nicaragua, I have since come to realize that the real entitlement has never been anger; it has always been its absence. The aversion to anger I had understood in terms of temperament or intention was, in all honesty, also a luxury. When the black feminist writer and activist Audre Lorde described her anger as a lifelong response to systemic racism, she insisted upon it as a product of the larger social landscape rather than private emotional ecology: \u201cI have lived with that anger, on that anger, beneath that anger, on top of that anger ... for most of my life.\u201d"]

The glorious cinematography, by Robbie Ryan, sharply illustrates the disparity between the rugged majesty of the landscape and the savagery of its outlaws and adventurers, who resemble vermin scuttling through the underbrush of a perilous no man\u2019s land. Set in Colorado in 1870 and filmed in New Zealand, \u201cSlow West\u201d follows as unlikely a pair of traveling companions as you\u2019ll find in a movie posing as a western. Its laconic narrator, Silas (Michael Fassbender), who speaks in clipped poetic phrases, is an experienced frontiersman and cynical bounty hunter who appoints himself the paid chaperone of Jay (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a 16-year-old innocent from the Scottish Highlands. They meet by chance when the boy, who has miraculously survived his arrival in the Wild West without a scratch, is being menaced by a stray Union soldier hunting Indians for sport. A son of aristocrats, Jay has traveled all the way to America in pursuit of his sweetheart, Rose (Caren Pistorius), a girl from a humbler background who has settled on the Plains in a cabin with her father, John (Rory McCann). Jay doesn\u2019t know it, but the father and daughter are the targets of bounty hunters responding to wanted posters, and Silas hopes the boy will lead him to their door. A flashback reveals that Rose thinks of Jay as a younger brother and not as a lover, a possibility that the besotted Jay refuses to entertain."]
["movies", "The Scottish flashbacks raise more questions than they answer about why and how the father and daughter fled their homeland to end up on the edge of a wheat field in the middle of nowhere. As played by Mr. Smit-McPhee (Viggo Mortensen\u2019s son in \u201cThe Road\u201d) Jay is so dewy and na\u00efve he suggests a mannequin freshly plucked out of clear plastic casing. Once Silas and Jay team up, they have a series of eerie encounters with various wanderers, dreamers and crooks. They come upon three affable Congolese musicians to whom Jay speaks French. At a general store, a desperate shotgun-wielding Swede and his wife demand money and pay with their lives as their two children wait patiently outside. Jay, briefly separated from Silas, encounters a friendly anthropologist in a covered wagon who says he is \u201crecounting the decline of the aboriginal tribes in the hope of preventing their extinction by their conversion to Christianity.\u201d Reunited, the travelers encounter a gang of outlaws whose sinister leader, Payne (Ben Mendelsohn), an acquaintance of Silas in an enormous fur coat, is a fellow bounty hunter. The first time they cross paths, Payne is alone, and the three get drunk on absinthe, pass out and wake up in a drenching rain. Mr. Mendelsohn, who steals the Netflix series \u201cBloodline,\u201d nearly does the same in \u201cSlow West.\u201d The characters who haven\u2019t already been dispatched converge in a shootout at the weirdly spick-and-span little house on the prairie occupied by Rose and her father. If you tallied up the number of shots fired by the characters, Rose would win hands down. She seems far too ferocious for the likes of Jay."]

["climate", "2017 Set a Record for Losses From Natural Disasters. It Could Get Worse. - The New York Times Insurers are set to pay out a record $135 billion to cover losses from natural disasters in 2017, the world\u2019s largest reinsurer said Thursday, driven by the costliest hurricane season ever in the United States and widespread flooding in South Asia. Overall losses, including uninsured damage, came to $330 billion, according to the reinsurer, Munich Re of Germany. That tally was second only to 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami in Japan contributed to losses of $354 billion at today\u2019s dollars. Insured losses from weather-related disasters were at a high, making up most of the $135 billion. Munich Re executives warned that losses would continue to escalate. \u201cSome of the catastrophic events, such as the series of three extremely damaging hurricanes, or the very severe flooding in South Asia after extraordinarily heavy monsoon rains, are giving us a foretaste of what is to come,\u201d Torsten Jeworrek, a Munich Re board member, said in a statement. While it was still difficult to attribute individual weather events to climate change, he said, \u201cour experts expect such extreme weather to occur more often.\u201d The United States made up an unusually high share of global insured losses last year \u2014 about 50 percent, compared with just over 30 percent on average. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas in August, was the most costly natural disaster of 2017, causing losses of $85 billion. Together with Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the 2017 hurricane season caused the most damage ever, with losses reaching $215 billion."]
["climate", "But that wasn\u2019t all. The devastating wildfire season in California drove insured losses to around $8 billion. And at least five severe thunderstorms across the country, accompanied by tornadoes and hail, caused insured losses of more than $1 billion each. Mark Bove, a senior research meteorologist at Munich Re, said in an interview that losses jumped in the United States because so many of the disasters hit highly populated areas: the Houston bay area, South Florida, Puerto Rico. That was a trend he expected to continue. People are moving to warmer climates, putting them in the path of hurricanes, and more people are affected by California\u2019s fires, he said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t build buildings to withstand the weather we see today, let alone what we might see as the climate changes in the next 10 to 20 years,\u201d he said. In Asia, heavy monsoon rains that lasted about four weeks longer than usual killed 2,700 people and caused $3.5 billion in total losses. The Terai lowlands in Nepal, home to almost half the Nepalese population, were most severely hit. In Europe, unusually low temperatures in April caused billions of dollars in damage to farmers, shrinking some harvests by 50 percent. The damage was especially costly because crops had already grown robustly in an otherwise warm spring. Similar volatile weather patters are set to become more frequent as the climate changes, Munich Re said in its news release."]

But instead of chasing down every tidbit of tech news, he built The Wirecutter, a recommendation site that posts six to 12 updates a month \u2014 not a day \u2014 and began publishing in partnership with The Awl, a federation of blogs founded by two other veterans of Gawker Media, Choire Sicha and Alex Balk."]
["business/media", "While there are many technology sites that evaluate and compare products, usually burying their assessments in a tsunami of other posts, Mr. Lam and his staff of freelancers decided to rely on deep examinations of specific product categories.

If you want new earphones or a robot vacuum, The Wirecutter will recommend The One and leave it at that. \u201cI was tired of doing posts that were obsolete three hours after I wrote them,\u201d Mr. Lam said. \u201cI wanted evergreen content that didn\u2019t have to be updated constantly in order to hunt traffic.

The clean, simple interface, without the clutter of news, is a tiny business; it has fewer than 350,000 unique visitors a month at a time when ad buyers are not much interested in anything less than 20 million. But The Wirecutter is not really in the ad business. The vast majority of its revenue comes from fees paid by affiliates, mostly Amazon, for referrals to their sites.

The Web is full of mom-and-pop shops that live on referral fees for things like pet supplies and camping gear. Many companies also pay for referrals \u2014 eBay, Half.com, even retailers like Gap and Old Navy. A business that used to be mired in spam is becoming far more legitimate.

After all, the fashion Owens presents four times a year, for men and women, on the grand Paris stage, isn\u2019t free and easy. It isn\u2019t simple. It often looks like rags: Precious fabrics, like cashmere, are pilled and laddered, and leather is repeatedly washed to give it the texture and appearance of a prehistoric animal\u2019s skin. There is something monstrous about his gothic garments, with their strange, disturbing proportions attenuated and exaggerated, draped like ectoplasm clinging to thin limbs. When people wear them head to toe, as Owens\u2019s most enthusiastic followers frequently do, they don\u2019t look human. They look other. \u201cTroll clothes for the most desperate lemmings in the fashion herd,\u201d one observer wrote in 2008 on The New York Times\u2019s On the Runway blog.

["t-magazine", "There is, however, a disconnect between Rick Owens the man and Rick Owens the fashion designer. In photographs, Owens looks arresting, even sinister, with his poker-straight black hair and shroudlike attire, like the Grim Reaper crossed with a West Coast surf bum.

Presented in print, Owens \u2014 generally quoted on topics such as death, renewal, creation \u2014 can come across like a prophet of the apocalypse. And those monstrous \u201ctroll clothes\u201d he designs often seem, at first glance, cold and hard, solid carapaces of fabric, sharply cut and difficult to wear. \u201cI miss archness,\u201d he murmurs, as if by way of explanation. \u201cI think there was an arch moment in the \u201940s in fashion, and I\u2019m thinking forward, thinking about fashion cycles \u2014 that\u2019s kind of a good cycle to bring back.\u201d But there\u2019s something unexpectedly soft about Owens, both the man and his clothes.

It adds both a humanity and a note of wry humor that collapses any perceived pretension. And in person, those clothes collapse too, in on themselves, softly wrapping the body in protective layers of felted fabric and down padding. Up close, his arch silhouettes prove light and pliable to the touch, seductive."]

Unlike many fashion designers, however, Owens is able to articulate, precisely and vividly, what he\u2019s trying to do with his clothes, namely talk about those big, overarching themes affecting humanity, and offer something different in the fashion landscape. When he talks, he makes you take him seriously. And he likes to talk."]

Sunday\u2019s presidential election in this Central African nation notwithstanding, weary citizens say, the message of the posters seems clear: El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, the crafty autocrat who ruled for 41 years, may be dead, but his reign is not necessarily over, thanks to his son. Not physically a candidate for the first time in decades, the elder Mr. Bongo, who died in June, still dominates a noisy campaign many here said they had hoped would be a turning point after years of autocracy. Anger over the dead leader\u2019s continued shadowy presence is easily encountered in the disheveled streets behind Mr. Bongo\u2019s hulking modernistic palaces, built with the immense oil wealth of Gabon, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s fourth largest producer and a tiny country that punches well beyond its weight as a result. Even though Ali Ben Bongo has tried to play down his father\u2019s legacy, ludicrously keeping the family name off his campaign posters, the truth is clear. None of the other 17 candidates (five pulled out Friday) can hope to match the power he brings to bear: all-pervasive influence bought and maintained by decades of oil riches."]

That legacy is at the heart of the election, even if it is not discussed by the principal candidates, many compromised by association with the elder Mr. Bongo\u2019s long-followed strategy of buy-and-rule. Last week, Ali Ben Bongo, campaigning here in a squalid district of shacks and open-air bars named Rio, promised schools, development projects and extensive cleanups, and, taking his cue from the gyrating people at his feet, he set his stocky frame to uneasy dancing on a stage as the music blared. In interviews, he promises that the country\u2019s riches will be distributed \u201cequitably.\u201d But at the campaign rally\u2019s edge, discontent simmered among those who had not accepted the T-shirts of the leading candidate. \u201cThe road ends outside Libreville,\u201d said Mathieu Ngoma, a biology instructor. \u201cAfter that we eat dust.

Their season, once filled with optimism and buoyed by a winning record, appears to be at a crossroads. Still, despite each slight, and indignity, and losing streak, the Knicks have been upbeat and reserved, directing most of their disgust at their shoddy defense. But Wednesday night, in a downbeat locker room, a pall clearly hung over the team. Coach Jeff Hornacek, normally able to display a smile and a sunny disposition, was glum. In a month that every pillar of the team signaled as important, the Knicks had suffered one defeat too stinging to wax away. They lost to the woebegone, process-driven Philadelphia 76ers, who in recent seasons have recently served as the laughingstocks of the league. As the final buzzer sounded, T. J. McConnell\u2019s shot fell through the hoop, giving the Sixers a 98-97 victory. The Knicks had taken a 17-point lead in the second quarter and blown it.

Just hours earlier, in an empty Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday morning, when the latest letdown for the Knicks was still hours away, Carmelo Anthony had assessed the problem in front of him. After two chaotic and surreal days, the Knicks had returned to what felt like normalcy. Their primary concern was once again the games, which have been a problem of a different order.

Anthony had 28 points, including 15 in the third quarter to spur a run that gave the Knicks an 11-point lead, but he did not score in the fourth. The past few dismal weeks have left the Knicks in a discordant place. They are still just three games out of a playoff spot in the middling Eastern Conference but also appear to be at risk of fracturing. Worries about Rose have dominated the headlines, but the team\u2019s problems lie deeper than the concerns over an erratic point guard. Anthony has had his problems, too. Although he is surrounded by more talent now than he has been in recent years, he entered Wednesday night with his shooting percentage at its lowest since his rookie season. He was ejected on Monday for a third time this season \u2014 a career high \u2014 after he was irked by what he saw as noncalls on three straight possessions.

["nyregion", "Investigators quickly traced the stolen Connecticut license plate on the Pathfinder to a Ford F-150 pickup truck that had been brought into Mr. LeBlanc\u2019s shop, Kramer\u2019s Used Auto Parts, in Stratford, for repairs three weeks earlier. And there it had sat. In an interview Sunday, Mr. LeBlanc said he had sold the truck some time ago to Elmo C. Jones of Bridgeport, who returned it last month for suspension work. But Mr. LeBlanc said he had been too busy to get to it. When investigators knocked on his door early Sunday, Mr. LeBlanc said he had not even been aware of the chaos that had enveloped Times Square several hours earlier. He told reporters he had spent the night watching \u201cOld Yeller\u201d with three of his grandchildren, who were having a sleepover at his house. The agents, accompanied by Norwalk police, told Mr. LeBlanc they wanted to talk to him about a serious matter, he said. They asked him about the Ford pickup. Mr. LeBlanc said he told them what he knew. Then \u201cthey asked me if I\u2019d take a ride to my business,\u201d he said in an interview on Sunday. With the agents and police in two cars behind him, Mr. LeBlanc led them on the 20-mile drive to his business. Mr. LeBlanc said he had not known that the license plates were missing. \u201cWe advertise in Connecticut and New York,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people walk in and look around. We don\u2019t keep a close watch on them.\u201d"]
["nyregion", "Mr. LeBlanc said that he did not object when the agents asked to take the truck with them and said that he was fully cooperating with the investigation. He said he would question his employees about the missing plate. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a thorough check,\u201d he promised. By Sunday afternoon, Mr. LeBlanc was getting peppered by phone calls and visits from reporters, though the police had not suggested that he or Mr. Jones, the owner of the Ford, were suspects. Camera trucks remained parked around Mr. LeBlanc\u2019s business on Monday. Mr. LeBlanc seemed to take the attention in stride when asked about it on Sunday. But he kept himself scarce on Monday, staying away from reporters. Mr. Jones did not return phone calls. Tom Manis, the owner of Manis Motor Sales in Bridgeport, said investigators visited his home in nearby Monroe at 6:45 a.m. Sunday. Local and state police, accompanied by three Joint Terrorism Task Force agents, escorted him to his dealership to look through files. They told him a sticker for the dealership had been found on the rear exterior of the Pathfinder. He said that being awakened by investigators was frightening, but that he was eager to help in any way he could. They did not have a vehicle identification number but asked him to search his records for sales of Pathfinders. He found one silver Pathfinder and one gold one that had been sold about 2004. Investigators quickly ran the identification numbers and determined that the cars had since been resold. \u201cThey were very thorough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just good police work, I guess, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re trained to do.\u201d"]

He seemed slightly disappointed that investigators had not contacted him in 24 hours, and said that he did not know if the files he had supplied them were useful.

["style", "Saturday Night's Sunday Morning - The New York Times IT was a scene to make the Church Lady blush. Inside a Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time lounge on the Upper East Side, far past the witching hour on a recent Sunday morning, Will Ferrell stood politely waiting for a beer while an uncouth comedy groupie asked him to ''do W'' -- his uncanny parody of the pronunciation-challenged President. He demurred (or should we say, ''dimmered''). A little way off, aswim in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, Rachel Dratch, in a low-cut black dress, was also fending off fans, in this case young men. And in the middle of it all stood the late-night regular Chris Kattan, with an aborted smile on his face. ''This,'' Mr. Kattan said, ''is a great party.'' It was impossible to tell from his tone whether the catty Mr. Kattan was being serious or sarcastic. What is certain, however, is that the ''Saturday Night Live'' after-party is the oldest established permanent floating cast party in New York. For the last 26 years, the cast and crew of ''S.N.L.'' have been assembling in dives and discos to chase away a week's worth of exhaustion with ample supplies of drink and cute hangers-on. The post-show scene has a storied, and sometimes debauched history, including a Rolling Stones blowout at the Rainbow Room in 1978 -- ''It might still be going on,'' said Alan Zweibel, one of the original writers for the show -- and the funny if slightly less glamorous gatherings on the set in Studio 8H, where legend holds that Jack Nicholson once nearly drove John Belushi through a wall while pushing the comedian around in a wheelchair."]
["style", "With the show's young cast riding a wave of good press and ratings, this season's parties have taken on a new vigor, running later and later into the night, spawning unofficial after-after-parties at apartments and inside shuttered bars. Weekend regulars include the cast members Mr. Ferrell, Mr. Kattan, Chris Parnell, Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz and Tracy Morgan, as well as a featured player, Jerry Minor. In addition to friends, the parties also draw a mix of would-be writers and comedians (hint: they're the guys without dates) and a smattering of downtown comic talents like Andy Blitz and Todd Barry. The post-show festivities, which are private affairs, begin with the traditional after-party, a catered event that begins after the show ends, usually at 1 a.m. This party, given in honor of the show's host, tends to be slightly formal (read stiff), with tables held for visiting Hollywood dignitaries, the guest band, network honchos and other important industry types. Lorne Michaels, the show's executive producer, usually takes a corner table, while interns and assistants stay around the bar, angling for a view of that week's guest stars. This official, ''S.N.L.''-sanctioned event ends at 4 a.m. But the show's current cast and crew members have initiated a Part 2 to the evening. For many, the after-after-party has become more popular than the official party, outgrowing its original locales (whoever's apartment was available) and slipping into local bars which lock their doors and allow the revelry to continue for an hour or two. While these shindigs were originally overpopulated by the no-name, little-pay staff members, some guest stars have begun dropping by. Recent sightings include Heather Graham, Lucy Liu, and Ben Affleck."]
["style", "To get in, you need to know the ever-changing locale (usually in the sleepy regions of the Upper East or Upper West Side). Sometimes guests get small paper slips with the address; other times it's a word-of-mouth invite. Because they take place after 4 a.m. -- the legal cutoff for selling alcohol at a bar -- the parties are by invitation only. There's also the occasional oddball password, like ''The eagle has landed.'' On a recent night about a month ago, I was tipped off to the location -- a bar in the East 70's -- and the password by a friend of a friend of a guy who used to work on the show. (He asked to remain anonymous, which is fine, since I never knew his name.) In this case, my source said, the password wasn't a word at all, but a signal; to enter, you had to scratch your nose when you approached the doorman. It sounded like a bad joke, but I made it past the nose guard. While no two parties are the same, there are a few constants, including some surprisingly serious conversations. ''A lot of people would be very disappointed how unfunny these events are,'' Mr. Zweibel said. ''There's definitely a sense of 'Cut it out, just be human for an hour.' '' Indeed, while the cast of characters has changed over the years, the prime objective of the post-show has remained the same: easing the transition from real ''live'' to real life."]
["style", "According to ''Saturday Night: A Backstage History of 'Saturday Night Live,' '' by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, even in the show's infancy in the mid-70's, the post-show parties were the place to be. Guests included the likes of David Bowie, Milos Forman and Mike Nichols. It was around that time that Belushi and Dan Aykroyd began the tradition of challenging dawn on Saturday nights, often dragging a retinue back to their own bar, the Blues Bar, in TriBeCa, to continue festivities after the official party had ended. There, according to ''Saturday Night,'' Belushi and Aykroyd would regularly jam as the Blues Brothers, throwing back quarts of beer and entertaining a rotating roster of rock stars, including Keith Richards and members of the Grateful Dead. After-parties also sometimes spilled onto the 17th floor of the G.E. Building at Rockefeller Plaza, where the show still has its offices. Mr. Weingrad, who has been attending the parties since the show's second season, said that today's scene seemed less ego-mad, and more relaxed than those dangerously decadent days. ''It seems like a more fun, looser group,'' he said. ''They seem like decent people.'' Or at least patient people. One recent after-after-party found Mr. Minor explaining the difference between sketch and stand-up comedy to a comedy naif, while Chris Parnell quietly listened to a young man's critique of his work on the show. He felt it necessary to tell Mr. Parnell that he was ''overplaying'' his characters. In short, just what you want to hear at 5 a.m."]
["style", "It helps that the show has rebounded from what many observers thought was a creative low-point in the mid-90's. Back then, Mr. Weingrad said, the stars were more standoffish and the mood blah. Now, however, party regulars say it's turned around. ''The ratings are up,'' said one, a writer. ''So the party's hot again.'' Perhaps a tad too hot, if last week's scene was any indication. I arrived at the official after-party  about 3 a.m., at Houston's, on East 54th Street and Third Avenue, and soon had the type of star sighting one expects at an event of this caliber. The star was Garry Shandling, and our conversation will echo in my brain for years to come. ''I don't know,'' Mr. Shandling said, unprompted. ''I don't know either,'' I said. He moved on. I haven't. When Houston's closed at 4, the party relocated to a nearby bar, a narrow, poorly lighted establishment with a bartendress who seemed bent on bringing the unflattering unitard back into the fashion mainstream. The place was packed. Packed, in fact, may not completely describe it. Sardines have it better. Despite this, the crowd, mainly in their 20's, seemed to get louder every time a new cast member pushed through the door. Tracy Morgan rolled through the room, confidently impervious to the jostling, while Jerry Minor stood pressed against the wall with a tall attractive blonde. The crowd kept coming, and by 4:30, it occurred to me that ''S.N.L.'' may have a few too many fans."]

["dining", "To Transform Your Weeknight Cooking, Turn On the Instant Pot - The New York Times (Need more instruction on using your multicooker? Our \u201cHow to Use an Instant Pot\u201d guide can help you master the device.) The hardest ingredient to find for any weeknight recipe is time. Tuesdays after work just don\u2019t have a lot of it, and it\u2019s not as if you can order it online. A slow cooker can help by doing the cooking while you\u2019re at the office. Just load it up in the morning and come home after work to a fragrant, hearty meal. The big thing missing here is spontaneity. If you\u2019re not the kind of cook who can commit to and then start prepping your dinner before you\u2019re fully caffeinated \u2014 or if you just can\u2019t get yourself organized to start cooking in advance at all \u2014 a slow cooker won\u2019t do you much good. But a multicooker like the Instant Pot just might. A multicooker is dinnertime convenience in stainless steel form, an appliance that combines an electric pressure cooker with a slow cooker, electric steamer and rice cooker. Several manufacturers make multicookers, including Breville and Fagor, but Instant Pot has become the best known in the United States. (Note that while most multicookers include a pressure-cooking function, there are some models that only slow cook, so check before you buy.) There\u2019s no other single gadget that can make weeknight cooking easier. It can cook food either quickly or slowly, and it does both consistently, evenly and automatically. Get one, and you can get rid of your slow cooker."]
["dining", "I bought a multicooker almost a year ago to report on for this newspaper. I figured that after  publishing my article, I\u2019d stick the machine in the basement with all the other once-in-a-while appliances (like that electric deep fryer). Then I\u2019d dig it out for braising the occasional large hunk of meat to tender perfection, which, as I immediately discovered, it does better than any other piece of equipment \u2014 Dutch ovens and slow cookers included. Over time, though, the multicooker became so embedded in the rhythm of my everyday cooking that I never unplugged it. I ended up writing my new cookbook for it, \u201cDinner in an Instant\u201d (Clarkson Potter), as well as an in-depth guide at NYT Cooking. It was the slow cooker that went into storage, where it will remain until my next stoop sale. What I especially love about the multicooker is its inherent flexibility, pleasing cooks of all temperaments. If you\u2019re an organized, plan-ahead type of person, you can use your multicooker exactly like a slow cooker. Just use the slow-cook setting with any of your old favorite slow-cooker recipes without even having to adjust them. Culinary procrastinators, on the other hand, can take full advantage of the pressure setting, which cooks food in minutes instead of hours. I\u2019m in the latter camp, and so this is my routine: On the way home from work, I stop at the store for some beans or grains or a package of chicken thighs. I throw them into the pot with a mix of interesting seasonings. Then I make a salad while the pot does its thing."]
["dining", "That\u2019s it. A satisfying dish that would normally take an hour or more is on the table in 20 to 30 minutes. Now earthy soups, supple stews and luscious braises are within reach for winter weeknights, instead of being relegated to weekends when I have hours to let them simmer. In the summer I can quickly cook beans and grains for salads without heating up the kitchen, or steam artichokes without having to stare at a pot on the stove. I don\u2019t even have to be home. No matter the season, my basic strategy for using my multicooker on weeknights remains constant: I estimate how many minutes I have before I want dinner to be on the table, and work backward from there. Often, getting my meal done in the shortest amount of time is simply a matter of how you cut up the ingredients \u2014 the smaller the pieces, the faster they will cook. So while a whole brisket or boneless pork shoulder might take 90 minutes to braise under pressure, beef stew meat cut into 1\u00bd-inch pieces, or pork ribs cut into two or three rib sections, will be tender in 20 to 25 minutes. Save the large, impressive, company-worthy pieces of meat for when you have more time. You can apply the same method for dense root vegetables like beets and potatoes.

Of course, you can\u2019t cut them up to make them cook more quickly, but you can select smaller beans. When time is tight, buy lentils, split peas or adzuki beans, which cook from their dried, unsoaked state in under 20 minutes. Save the chickpeas, kidney beans and cannellinis for when you\u2019ve got close to an hour. As for those chicken thighs, my go-to method is to buy them boneless, cut them into pieces and then throw them in the pot with pretty much any combination of spices, aromatics and condiments, to cook in under 10 minutes. Add barbecue sauce and you\u2019ll get barbecued chicken. Coconut milk, a can of tomatoes and garam masala result in a creamy, currylike dish. A squirt each of sriracha, lime juice, soy sauce and honey, along with a grated garlic clove, gives you something far tastier than it should for the amount of work you put in. If you use breasts instead of thighs, they\u2019ll cook even more quickly, though be careful not to overdo it because they\u2019ll dry out. After using the machine consistently for nearly a year, I can say that if you stick to what it does best \u2014 stewing, braising, simmering, steaming \u2014 you\u2019ll be amply rewarded. Just don\u2019t attempt to cook anything crunchy or golden, because it probably won\u2019t end well. No matter how many multicooker roast chicken recipes you may stumble across on the internet, don\u2019t believe them.

["books", "Fun Home - Alison Bechdel - Books - The New York Times Alison Bechdel's \"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic\" is an engrossing memoir that does the graphic novel format proud. The tale \u2014 about Ms. Bechdel's childhood, her father's death and their shared homosexuality \u2014 is painfully honest and richly detailed in words and images. At its heart \"Fun Home\" captures Ms. Bechdel yearning to connect with her father, Bruce Allen Bechdel. In the opening chapter, \"Old Father, Old Artificer,\" parent and child are playing a game of \"airplane\" that ends almost as soon as it begins. The sight of a filthy rug and loose molding ends the brief lull from her father's obsessive restoration of the family's Victorian home. Her father \"could spin garbage into gold\"  and \"cultivate the barren yard into a lush, flowering landscape,\" Ms. Bechdel writes and draws, but he was so emotionally distant that, even before his death, she \"ached as if he were already gone.\" With the dramatic personae established, the subsequent chapters depict pivotal events in the family's history. Along the way we learn that Mr. Bechdel was a part-time English teacher  and a third-generation funeral director.  (\"Fun Home\" is what the children called the building where he practiced his trade.)  Despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 growing up around the rituals of mourning, Ms. Bechdel recalls the stunted reaction to her father's death: \"Dry-eyed and sheepish, my brothers and I looked for as long as we sensed it was appropriate. If only they made smelling salts to induce grief-stricken swoons, rather than snap you out of them.\""]
["books", "The death was deemed an accident \u2014  a truck hit him as he crossed a road with an armful of garden brush \u2014  but Ms. Bechdel suspects suicide. The timeline she supplies makes a reasonable case. Four months before the fatal day she informed her parents that she was a lesbian. Her mother countered with news about her husband's affairs with men. Two weeks before Mr. Bechdel's death, his wife asked for a divorce.  \"If I had not felt compelled to share my little sexual discovery,\" Ms. Bechdel writes, \"perhaps the semi would have passed without incident.\" There are some feelings of guilt in that statement, but also a grasp at connection. Where father and daughter had the strongest relationship was in books, whether in discussing them or using them as tools of seduction. Her father invited his \"more promising high school students\" \u2014 the muscular, male ones, it seems \u2014 to visit his home to borrow copies of great American novels like \"The Sun Also Rises\" and \"The Great Gatsby.\"  Later, as part of her \"dawning feminism,\" Ms. Bechdel recalls a private, erotic reading of \"James and the Giant Peach.\"  The Bechdels are closest when she is the only student in his English class who does not seem consumed by lethargy. Literature also plays a large role in Ms. Bechdel's self-discovery. \"My realization at 19 that I was a lesbian came about in a manner consistent with my bookish upbringing,\" she writes. That statement is part of an electric two-page sequence  in which the author, after discovering books about gay people, takes the first tentative steps toward coming out."]
["books", "Throughout the memoir, but most especially here, the magic of the graphic  format emerges. Ms. Bechdel's  qualms, trepidation and excitement emerge from the words and images working together. Somehow adding the two ingredients together conveys more than either one could do alone. That incredible alchemy is clearly evident and most effectively used in Chapter 5, \"The Canary-Colored Caravan of Death.\" A caption describes Ms. Bechdel's home as an artists' colony. The image shows the family in the house, with each member in his or her own bubble of solitude, writing, playing the guitar or doing restoration work.  These pages also chronicle the beginning, at age 10, of the author's obsessive-compulsive disorder, which, on the good side, helped her become such a meticulous archivist of her life. Here again the images enhance the text. We see the number of edges of flooring Ms. Bechdel felt compelled to count before she could cross a threshold. Or how, doubting her own diary, she obsessively began adding the phrase \"I think\" to each sentence. (To save time, \"I think\" eventually became a symbol that she would add to whole pages of the journal.) With a closeted father in the house, perhaps it was natural to doubt the truth. At 13  Ms. Bechdel gets a hint of her father's secret when he confides that he has been ordered by the court to see a psychiatrist. His reason is simply: \"I'm bad. Not good like you.\""]
["books", "The mandated six months of counseling  hints at a more serious offense than the official charge of offering beer to a minor in his car.  The most direct communication father and daughter shared is recalled in a particularly powerful two-page sequence.  On a ride to a movie theater, eyes never leaving the road, Ms. Bechdel's father tentatively talks about his sexual experiences. She feels a surge of connection, but the moment passes all too soon. The bittersweet relationship of parent and child is conveyed again and again in \"Fun Home.\" Fittingly, the memoir ends with two images that echo the bad times and the good. The top half of the final page shows the truck about to strike; the bottom half depicts daughter, in mid-leap, waiting to be caught in her father's arms. The juxtaposition of the two images is compelling and striking. They also offer reader and author a choice: appreciate what was had or continue to yearn. In completing \"Fun Home\" Ms. Bechdel may have finally ended her longing."]

By early afternoon, the worst of the storm had passed through the Bay Area, but flooding remained a concern. As water gushed from storm drains, forming small rivers along roads in the small East Bay community of Orinda, Linda Stepanek, in a raincoat and rubber-soled shoes, spent part of the day cleaning up the mess the rain had left behind. Heavy wind blew over chairs and planters on her deck, where a pool of standing water remained Thursday night. As the drenching rain lashed down all day, she said, she began to worry that huge oak trees towering over her house and her property might fall if their shallow roots became saturated. Nonetheless, she seemed unconcerned about mudslides. \u201cOur house is built on the side of a hill,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have piers so deep into the bedrock that if the hill goes, the house will stay.\u201d Agapito Granado, a manager at the Orinda True Value Hardware store, said that, as the storm approached, Wednesday \u201cwas the busiest day in five years.\u201d"]

By Thursday morning, Mr. Granado said, the line of customers stretched halfway through the store. \u201cYou knew they were coming here as a last shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were kind of behind the boat.\u201d Sandbags were almost sold out, he said, with the more expensive reusable bags going \u201cat $40 a pop.\u201d Diana Henderson, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the storm had inched along Thursday, adding \u201cthat\u2019s part of the problem \u2014 the rain is over one spot for a prolonged period.\u201d While 2.36 inches of rain fell in San Francisco on Thursday, Venado, a tiny community in the North Bay area, received 8.5 inches of rain, said Steve Anderson of the National Weather Service station in Monterey. Much of San Francisco lost power in the morning after a Pacific Gas & Electric substation was knocked out, affecting 85,000 customers \u2014 about one in five in the city.

The Bay Area Rapid Transit station at Montgomery Street, which serves the financial district, was shut down Thursday morning. A spokesman for the transit authority said an electrical transformer appeared to have malfunctioned, but service was restored by late afternoon. High wind canceled some ferry service east of San Francisco. Schools in San Francisco, Oakland and Marin Counties closed Thursday before the heaviest rain began, with administrators fearing that students heading to school could be endangered. Some of the Bay Area\u2019s colleges, including City College of San Francisco, Golden Gate University and Skyline College in San Bruno, were also closed. In Woodacre, north of San Francisco, the National Weather Service reported that two inches of rain had fallen in three hours by midmorning. A flash flood warning was issued for Alameda, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. Drains in some communities were backing up, and some firehouses ran out of sandbags to distribute.

An 11-year-old boy was hurt in Santa Cruz when a tree fell on him as he waited to go to school. Rescuers needed a chain saw to free the\u00a0boy, who was treated at a hospital and released. And a section of State Highway 1 in Marin County collapsed, forcing some lane closings, according to the California Highway Patrol. While California\u2019s reservoirs are depleted and the region desperately needs the rain, the ground here is saturated from recent storms. With high winds, trees with shallow roots could topple, and some feared that the rains could bring mudslides.

The church next door was to stay open longer Thursday to allow the homeless to come in from the rain. Some made the best of the soggy conditions. Kayakers and canoeists paddled around partially submerged cars in a supermarket lot in Healdsburg, a 70-mile drive north of San Francisco. The California Highway Patrol warned motorists in Marin County, north of San Francisco, to stay off the roads.

["business", "Generic A.D.H.D. Drug, Not Equivalent to the Brand, Is in Use Anyway - The New York Times When Dr. Louis Kraus, a chief of child psychiatry at a hospital in Chicago, writes prescriptions for patients who have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, he often chooses Concerta, an extended-release form of the drug Ritalin that gives patients relief from their symptoms for as long as 12 hours. He was unconcerned when, a few years ago, pharmacies began substituting lower-cost generic alternatives for brand-name Concerta \u2014 after all, generic drugs are widely seen as effective and account for the overwhelming majority of prescriptions filled nationwide. His feelings changed last November, however, when the Food and Drug Administration announced that two of the three available Concerta generics, one made by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and the other by UCB, could no longer be considered the equivalent of the brand and, in most states, could not be automatically substituted by pharmacies for the brand name. The agency said that although it considered the drugs to be safe, its own lab tests and other analyses suggested that their effectiveness began to wear off much more quickly \u2014 after about seven hours. That time frame is important, because the pill can be taken only once a day. The agency allowed the companies to continue selling their drugs, but gave them six months to either prove the drugs were equivalent, or remove them from the market."]
["business", "Seven months later, the deadline has passed and the drugs are still being sold. Major pharmacies like CVS and Rite Aid continue to stock them, and together the drugs have managed to hold on to about 30 percent of the market. (A third product, sold by Actavis, was found to be equivalent to the brand. Johnson & Johnson makes Concerta as well as the Actavis generic.) \u201cThis has gone on for months,\u201d said Dr. Kraus, who is the chief of child psychiatry at Rush University Medical Center. The lack of action by the F.D.A., he said, has undermined his faith in generics. \u201cWe\u2019re as much in the black as the patients are. And then we find this out, and it\u2019s really frightening.\u201d UCB has said it submitted new information last week that will show it is equivalent to Concerta, although it has not shared that information publicly. But Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals has taken a different tack: It is challenging the agency\u2019s decision in court. Both companies say they have no plans to withdraw their products. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. declined to comment because of the Mallinckrodt lawsuit. In part, the dispute reflects the controversy around the ability of generic companies to reproduce extended-release drugs, which require more technical expertise to manufacture. The F.D.A. has said it is looking more closely at extended-release generics and has set aside $20 million to test generics for safety and quality. Attention-deficit drugs were among the agency\u2019s initial targets."]
["business", "When Concerta was approved in 2000, it was welcomed by doctors because it eliminated the need for patients to take Ritalin three times a day. Previous efforts at developing long-acting forms of the drug had not been as successful. With Concerta, parents could give a child a pill before the child left for school, eliminating midday trips to the school nurse\u2019s office for a new dose. Concerta\u2019s secret was the way that it released the drug: The pill absorbed fluid as it passed through the body, and pumped the active drug out of a laser-cut hole. Under F.D.A. rules, generic companies do not need to use the same mechanisms to produce copycat versions of long-acting drugs. The manufacturers must instead prove that their products release the drug into the body at the same rate as the brand-name drug. The Mallinckrodt and UCB products use different techniques, which may account for the shorter effectiveness. When word of the F.D.A.\u2019s November decision spread, many Wall Street analysts expected that sales of the two drugs would plummet or that Mallinckrodt and UCB would follow the path of the drug maker Teva, which in 2012 withdrew its version of an extended-release version of Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, after the F.D.A. made a similar decision about its product. Mallinckrodt\u2019s stock dropped 7 percent at the time, but has since rebounded. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019re seeing something exactly like this,\u201d said Ronny Gal, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. \u201cI kind of thought the F.D.A. would tell them to go away. They haven\u2019t.\u201d"]
["business", "Instead, Mallinckrodt went on the offensive. And Actavis, now the only approved substitute for Concerta, raised its prices. Dr. Kraus, the child psychiatrist, said he still fielded regular calls from pharmacies and some insurers asking him to change his prescriptions so they can dispense the cheaper generics \u2014 drugs that he considers inferior. \u201cI\u2019m enraged about it,\u201d Dr. Kraus said. Representatives for CVS and Rite Aid said they sell all three generic versions and noted that the F.D.A. has said they are safe. A spokesman for CVS, Michael J. DeAngelis, denied that the company was directing pharmacies to ask doctors to switch their prescriptions. He would not comment on suggestions by some that pharmacies and insurers are motivated to sell the cheaper brands because they reap financial benefits from doing so. He said CVS was dispensing more of the Actavis product than the other two versions. Rite Aid would not comment on its financial arrangements with the generic companies, or on whether its pharmacists were asking doctors to switch prescriptions. A spokeswoman for Walgreens said the Actavis product had been its preferred generic since 2011, although it continues to stock the other two versions because some doctors write prescriptions for them; more than 99 percent of its extended-release prescriptions were filled with the Actavis product in May. In November, Actavis held about 50 percent of the market for generic Concerta, according to an analysis Mr. Gal provided. As of May, that share had grown to 70 percent, but the two other products still hold a significant portion of the market."]

Four months after cab fares increased by roughly 17 percent, it is perhaps not surprising to learn how New Yorkers have been greeting the news: They will always ride, it seems, but they do not have to be happy about it. According to data compiled by the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission, overall ridership has remained remarkably stable since the increase, falling just 1.67 percent compared with the same period in 2011. A review of tips for cabbies, however, introduces a wrinkle. For riders who pay by credit card, tips have fallen, as a percentage of the fare, to 15.5 percent. An earlier review by the commission found that credit card tips exceeded 20 percent in fall 2009. Data from October and November of 2010 and 2011 placed average credit card tips closer to 17 percent. Data is not available for tips made in cash. \u201cSome people know about the hike, and just don\u2019t like it and just don\u2019t tip,\u201d said Chrishna Sooknanan, 27, a taxi driver from Flatbush, Brooklyn. \u201cPeople see the 50-cent surcharge from the M.T.A. and figure it\u2019s a tip.\u201d (The surcharge went into effect in 2009 to aid the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is perennially short on cash.)"]
["nyregion", "David S. Yassky, the city\u2019s taxi commissioner, cautioned that any change in tipping patterns might have more to do with math than rider resentment. In purely monetary terms, average tips are up 8 percent to $2.29, from $2.12, on fares paid by card. It is the tip percentage that has fallen, because fares have increased at a far greater rate. If passengers are accustomed to tipping, say, $3 on their daily rides, Mr. Yassky reasoned, they might continue to do so even as the fare rises. \u201cIt\u2019s behavior staying the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThat drop is just an artifact of the pre-existing behavior.\u201d But there may be another explanation. Perhaps drivers\u2019 tips have become less tethered to the metered fare itself. (Just as deliverymen might expect the same fistful of $1 bills whether they are carrying $10 worth of food or $50 worth.) Graham Hodges, a taxi historian and former driver, said the question of how to define cabbies within the service industry had long influenced tips. \u201cThere\u2019s always a tension of whether to perceive the cabdriver as an independent-business man who has costs like you and me, or as a servant,\u201d Mr. Hodges said. \u201cI think people would like to see the cabdriver as a servant\u201d \u2014 someone perhaps more entitled to a tip \u2014 \u201cbut they\u2019re unable to.\u201d Expanded use of credit cards may have also changed the dynamic.

You feel more compelled to give them a better tip.\u201d Mr. Yassky noted that most credit card users ignore the suggested tip amounts on the back-seat monitor, which lists options for tips of 20 percent, 25 percent or 30 percent. He said the amounts that riders put in themselves sometimes exceeded the suggested totals. \u201cI was shocked when I found this out,\u201d he said. New Yorkers, he concluded, \u201cdon\u2019t like to be pushed around.\u201d Interviews with taxi riders yielded myriad justifications for tipping decisions: Drivers choose the wrong route. The economy is weak. Fares are too high as it is. Others insisted they would never dream of shortchanging drivers but offered tales of less virtuous friends. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to skimp on tips,\u201d Kira Shalom, from Hell\u2019s Kitchen, said of her clan. \u201cIt was a protest \u2014 \u2018If I have to pay more for this fare, he\u2019s getting less.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Francesca Mixco, 29, from Astoria, Queens, allowed that she had become \u201chorrible\u201d to cabdrivers, tipping \u201cmaybe a dollar\u201d on a typical ride.

The restaurant business can be seen as a class struggle between the groomed, pressed, articulate charmers working in the dining room and the blistered, stained and profane grunts in the kitchen. The rise of chefs that are also owners has brought a few of the grunts to power. But as the average tip has risen to 20 percent or so from 15 percent, the pay for line cooks, dishwashers and others has stayed low. At Coi, in San Francisco, Daniel Patterson, the chef and owner, levies an 18 percent service charge to be \u201cshared by the entire staff,\u201d the menu notes.

Front-of-house workers are suing one respected restaurant after another, including Dovetail, last month, accusing them of playing fast and loose with the laws on tips.

But avoiding those who fall ill is no guarantee of safety: People often catch the disease from carriers who have the bacteria but who show no symptoms, a condition affecting as much as 25 percent of the population.

["us", "Criminologists and police officials said smaller departments and those that lack sufficient funding or are understaffed are most likely to hire applicants with problematic pasts if they have completed state-mandated training, which allows departments to avoid the cost of sending them to the police academy. Such officers can start work almost immediately, usually at a modest salary. But police officials say most departments perform reasonably well in discovering when officers have histories of misconduct. In addition to checking applicants\u2019 work and criminal histories, and having a psychologist interview them, departments like those in Seattle and Austin, Tex., check credit histories. The Houston and Phoenix police departments are among those that administer polygraph tests. Roger Goldman, an emeritus law professor at St. Louis University and an authority on police licensing laws, said that using the National Practitioner Data Bank for physicians as a model, the government must establish a database of officers who have criminal convictions, have been fired or forced to resign, have had their law enforcement licenses revoked, or have been named in a judgment or settlement involving misconduct. \u201cAfter Ferguson and the other stuff that\u2019s happened, if we can\u2019t get this done now, when are we going to get it done?\u201d he said. Last year, in a report by President Obama\u2019s task force on 21st-century policing, law enforcement officials and others recommended that the Justice Department establish a database in partnership with the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training, which manages a database of officers who have been stripped of their police powers.

He said that while his group was investigating hiring practices in St. Louis County, Mo., after Mr. Brown\u2019s death, it found that officers facing severe discipline and possible termination in many agencies were routinely allowed to resign to avoid a record of having been fired. \u201cThey could then join another area department,\u201d Mr. Wexler said. Mr. Sullivan, who became the police chief in Cedar Vale, Kan., after being convicted on a harassment charge for kissing a 10-year-old girl, had been the second-highest-ranking officer in Coquille, Ore., before he was forced to resign in November 2004.

["world/europe", "Dutch Vote Watched Across Europe With a Finger in the Wind - The New York Times THE HAGUE \u2014 Elections in the Netherlands on Wednesday are being watched especially closely across Europe and beyond as a key gauge of whether formerly strong barriers to the far right still stand on a continent with painful memories of fascism, but also with a growing number of aspiring nationalist leaders. The Dutch vote is the first of several critical European elections this year, to be followed by those in France, Germany and possibly Italy. A common thread in the campaigns has been attacks on the European Union for diluting sovereignty, opening borders to migrants and leaving nations vulnerable to terrorism. \u201cThese are the quarterfinals in trying to prevent the wrong sort of populism from winning,\u201d Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and leader of the center-right People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy, said of the Dutch election. \u201cThe half finals are in France in April and May and in September in Germany, we have the finals,\u201d he said. Almost everywhere populist parties have risen with nationalist calls to stem immigration to secure and preserve local cultures. The question now is whether the populists will maintain their momentum or be blunted by a newfound hesitancy among voters. Even as support for centrist parties craters nearly everywhere, some analysts see new hints of wariness of the protest and anti-elite votes that aided the rise of recent populist politicians, given the uncertainty and conflict ushered in by the first weeks of the Trump administration and the British vote last year to exit the European Union, or Brexit."]
["world/europe", "Hajo Funke, a political scientist at the Free University in Berlin, said he had detected early signs in the past several weeks of a backlash against populism. In Germany, for example, the far-right Alternative for Germany party has slipped in the polls. Mr. Funke said he thought that voters in Europe were looking at Brexit and the Trump presidency not as points of inspiration, but rather with deep concern. \u201cThere is no Trump effect,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d On the current moment for populist parties, he said, \u201cI see stagnation, or decline.\u201d In the Netherlands, Mr. Funke noted, Geert Wilders, one of the most stridently anti-Muslim politicians in Europe, has struggled to improve his standing in recent weeks after climbing quickly in the polls. \u201cThere is a danger that it can go out of control, as far as the voting for Wilders,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I doubt that will be the case.\u201d Even if populists like Mr. Wilders do not prevail, other analysts said, their high profiles and often inflammatory presence had moved much of the political debate to the far right\u2019s turf. The battle in many ways is already won. \u201cSince the entrance of Geert Wilders into the political arena, he hasn\u2019t had any office but he has exerted influence,\u201d said Bert Bakker, a communications professor at the University of Amsterdam. Discussions in the Netherlands now often center on restrictions on immigrants, identity politics and nationalism."]
["world/europe", "Professors, pollsters and others who closely watch elections emphasize that, at least in the Netherlands, the far right is not going to win or control the government \u2014 or even come close \u2014 not least because the other right-leaning parties have promised publicly not to work with Mr. Wilders in a coalition. That has not stopped them from adopting somewhat milder versions of the far right\u2019s positions on many issues. One result is that the far right\u2019s views have dominated the debate, crowding out other views and issues. \u201cEven if these parties are not actually winning or part of the government, everything is moving to a more anti-immigration stance, more pro-nationalist, to try to win voters who are the losers in globalization,\u201d said Jasper Muis, a professor of sociology at the Free University of Amsterdam, who studies populism. \u201cImmigration and asylum seekers become the focus on the one hand and values and norms on the others,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not much is said about economic development or employment and that\u2019s a part of the success story of the populist right: that they\u2019ve been able to make it difficult to talk about other subjects.\u201d In the most optimistic outlooks, Mr. Wilders, who heads the Freedom Party, will get about 15 percent of the vote. Even if his votes were combined with those of other far-right and anti-establishment parties, the combined number of likely seats in the 150-seat Parliament would not exceed about 30, or 20 percent of the Parliament."]
["world/europe", "However, the Christian Democratic Appeal party is promoting a line almost as conservative on immigration as that of Mr. Wilders, a change from its more moderate position of several years ago. That party now looks likely to win about as many seats as Mr. Wilders, and if the mainstream right\u2019s seats are added to that, the far-right and center-right parties would have a majority. Even if the right has dominated the campaign, the reality is that the Netherlands is deeply divided and its centrist parties are losing ground in an increasingly fractured political landscape. There are 28 parties on the ballot. Only between 10 and 12 will get enough votes to win a seat in Parliament. There are still likely to be four or five parties in the governing coalition \u2014 all but guaranteeing it will include both left- and right-leaning parties. For that reason some experienced observers of European politics say the rightward drift by the Dutch may be more important as a harbinger of trends on the Continent than for its practical impact. Some analysts are far more worried about the French vote, because the far-right leader of the National Front, the presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, has a bloc of voters that is much more solidified behind her. \u201cThe bloc for Le Pen is very consistent, which is different than the other populists,\u201d said Mr. Funke of the Free University in Berlin."]
["world/europe", "An even greater concern may be Italy, where the populist Five Star party and the Northern League could win if elections are held, in part on a platform proposing a referendum on whether Italy should continue to use the euro. That could trigger a loss of confidence by foreign investors and capital flight from the Continent. \u201cItaly is potentially the worst case because if they are forced by election results to have a euro referendum,\u201d Mr. Funke said, \u201cthen there would be a big danger.\u201d"]
["world/europe", "In Greece, Leftist Party, Syriza, Upends Politics - The New York Times ATHENS \u2014 The collapse of Greece\u2019s dominant parties in Sunday\u2019s elections swept a new political force onto the scene here: the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, a pro-euro yet anti-austerity party that has Greece\u2019s creditors trembling with its calls for the country to reject its current loan agreement and nationalize the banks. Although Syriza\u2019s energetic 37-year-old leader, Alexis Tsipras, failed to form a left-wing governing coalition, his party\u2019s unexpected success \u2014 with 16.8 percent of the vote, besting the once-mighty Socialists, who garnered only 13 percent, and placing second after the center-right New Democracy\u2019s 18.8 percent \u2014 has upended Greece\u2019s political order. As political leaders struggle to form a government, Mr. Tsipras has emerged as a rising star in Greek politics. He turned down an offer from the Socialists to join a multiparty coalition, that way making it ever more likely that Greece will be forced into new elections next month. If so, that will be fine with Mr. Tsipras, whose party is now the country\u2019s most popular, with support from 24 percent of the electorate, according to a survey this week by the polling company Marc for the Alpha television channel. Mr. Tsipras is hoping to follow the success of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France and ride a tide of anti-austerity sentiment to convince even more Greeks that Syriza is not simply a protest vote but a responsible alternative to the status quo, a break from four decades of ossified two-party government in a country where the debt crisis has redrawn the political map."]
["world/europe", "\u201cI could not even imagine some months ago that Tsipras would be the second party and would have a chance to rule,\u201d said Nikos Xydakis, a political analyst. In Mr. Xydakis\u2019s view, after the cold war and the boom years, the debt crisis pushed Greece into a new historical cycle. \u201cWe are in the beginning of the great European depression, and Greece is the first link to crack, so politics change and Alexis Tsipras tries to begin another circle. He\u2019s very good at capturing the momentum.\u201d Yet, with the fate of Greece hanging in the balance, it remains to be seen whether the party\u2019s success in elections that Greeks saw as the triumph of democracy over market forces is evidence of a new \u201cGreek spring,\u201d as one Syriza legislator put it, or a sign that Greece is committing \u201cnational suicide,\u201d as a Socialist critic would have it. Critics say that Syriza is dangerously detached from the reality that Greece must either accept the terms of the loan agreements it signed with its foreign lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 or prepare to leave the euro. Mr. Tsipras calls such talk \u201cblackmail\u201d and contends that if Greece is forced to leave the euro, it will be the result of the ill-conceived agreement itself and over-the-top austerity measures that helped batter the economy."]
["world/europe", "Beyond a rejection of the country\u2019s current loan agreement and the austerity measures that come with it, the party is also calling for a three-year suspension of debt repayment until the economy has recovered and the abolition of immunity for government ministers. On Thursday, Mr. Tsipras sent letters to European leaders urging an overhaul of the European strategy of austerity and stating that \u201cthe common future of the European nations is threatened by these catastrophic choices.\u201d On the spectrum, Syriza falls between the Greek Communist Party, which never broke with Moscow during the cold war and rejects the euro and the European Union, and the Socialist Party, known as Pasok, which is seen as more of a patronage network than an ideology. Syriza is an umbrella of leftist parties ranging from softer-line communists to Marxists to social democrats. The \u201cradical\u201d in its Greek name translates more accurately as \u201cnontraditional.\u201d Still, in December 2008, the year Mr. Tsipras assumed party leadership, he was roundly criticized for not having condemned the violent elements that rioted in downtown Athens for days after the police killed a teenager. The party\u2019s nonhierarchical structure means that under the guise of moderates, \u201cfar-left groups sometimes control the policy\u201d of the party, said Paschos Mandravelis, a columnist for Kathimerini, a daily newspaper. Mr. Xydakis said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to destroy capitalism. I think that he is much more pragmatic, and he feels now that he has some power, he must give to the suffering people some reforms to make their lives better.\u201d"]
["world/europe", "With dark good looks and a charisma that some liken to that of Andreas Papandreou, the founder of Pasok and a wildly popular former prime minister, Mr. Tsipras ran a disciplined campaign in which Syriza was present in all forms of grass-roots protest movements.

But some say that for a reformer, Mr. Tsipras has shown few practical proposals and little interest in making structural changes to Greece\u2019s dysfunctional public administration. Critics say the party is immature and question whether Mr. Tsipras has the gravitas or the stamina to govern. \u201cHe has never been tested in actually making decisions that have to do with the future of the country; he was just protesting all the previous decisions,\u201d Mr. Mandravelis said. Those who know him disagree. \u201cThere is no doubt that he can govern because not only is he adequate, but he has also done his homework,\u201d said Christophoros Kasdaglis, a Syriza supporter and the author of numerous books on the Greek left. \u201cHe has complete control over his party\u2019s policies.\u201d But Mr. Kasdaglis acknowledged that the party was struggling with an identity conflict, being both \u201cEurocentric and in conflict with Europe.\u201d"]

The announcement of the air patrols, plus a separate statement that China would conduct military exercises in the South China Sea off the coast of Hainan Island, came as Adm. John M. Richardson, the chief of United States naval operations, was in Beijing to discuss the South China Sea and other issues that arose after the tribunal rebuked China\u2019s claims over the waters on July 12. The landmark decision rejected China\u2019s assertion that it enjoys historical rights over a huge area of the South China Sea encompassed by a \u201cnine-dash line.\u201d China had argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction in the matter."]
["world/asia", "China\u2019s announcement of military exercises and patrols as a response to the ruling had been expected by analysts. But Beijing also moved to contain any public anger over the tribunal\u2019s decision. Demonstrators in China called for boycotts at about a dozen KFC outlets on Monday to protest the United States\u2019 role in the South China Sea dispute. But the protests were small compared with previous nationalist outpourings in China, and the state news media warned demonstrators not to disturb social order. The angry mobs of people rallying outside embassies in the Chinese capital, a regular feature in the past when China wanted to vent its grievances, never materialized. Flying combat aircraft over international waters is also a more mild response than other measures China could have taken, like initiating reclamation work on the disputed Scarborough Shoal or setting up a so-called air defense identification zone in the South China Sea, in which China would require that aircraft entering the zone identify themselves or face a military response, said Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia. \u201cI think China is licking its wounds and taking stock,\u201d Mr. Graham said by telephone. \u201cThe real unknown is how this will play out internally.\u201d On Monday, Admiral Richardson\u2019s Chinese counterpart, Adm. Wu Shengli, said China would continue construction in the South China Sea. In the past two years, China has reclaimed thousands of acres on seven features in the Spratly Islands, an area where Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims, building ports, large airstrips and radar installations."]
["world/asia", "\u201cWe will never stop our construction on the Nansha Islands halfway,\u201d Xinhua, in a separate report, quoted Admiral Wu as saying, using the Chinese name for the Spratly chain. \u201cThe Nansha Islands are China\u2019s inherent territory, and our necessary construction on the islands is reasonable, justified and lawful.\u201d Significantly, the Xinhua report on the air patrols said the flights encompassed Scarborough Shoal, a fishing ground far to the north of the Spratlys off the coast of Luzon Island in the Philippines. China seized control of the shoal in 2012, using coast guard vessels to bar Filipino fishermen. A photograph released by Xinhua showed a Chinese bomber flying near the shoal. \u201cIt is an aerial version of showing the flag,\u201d Mr. Graham said, adding that air patrols were far less provocative than reclamation work, which would probably inflame tensions with both the Philippines and the United States. The Xinhua article did not say when the air patrol took place and did not provide any details, other than saying that the bombers were H-6K aircraft, a modification of a 1950s-era Soviet design that carries cruise missiles. Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that a more telling test of China\u2019s posture after the decision last week may come when the United States Navy resumes so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, which often involve testing Chinese claims by ordering American ships to transit within 12 nautical miles of Chinese-claimed features."]

The provincial officials agreed to the meeting after residents here threatened to march on Wednesday morning to government offices in the nearby city of Lufeng. Villagers said late Tuesday that they would postpone the march to see what kinds of concessions, if any, provincial officials were willing to offer.

["world/asia", "The meeting was the first with province-level officials, and it contrasted sharply with the denunciations and threats of arrest that have defined the official response to the protests since the standoff began. The negotiations were led by the deputy chief of the provincial Communist Party committee, Zhu Mingguo, and the party secretary of the administrative region of Shanwei, Zheng Yanxiong. Mr. Zhu is a top lieutenant to the provincial party secretary, Wang Yang, one of China\u2019s most prominent political leaders and an unspoken candidate for a spot on China\u2019s ruling body, the standing committee of the Politburo, when membership in the body, which now has nine seats, turns over next year. The abrupt shift of negotiations to provincial leaders, after days of fruitless talks with officials of local governments, suggested that Mr. Wang was taking charge and hoping to broker a peaceful settlement of a crisis whose outcome could weigh heavily on his political future. In midmorning, as officials began arriving outside the village, hundreds of residents lined the roadside. Dozens held up a red banner that welcomed the officials \u201cto come to Lufeng to resolve the Wukan incident.\u201d Inside Wukan, in a council meeting hall, bags of rice were piled high in a corner to dole out to poorer families. Since party officials abandoned the area days ago, security forces have turned back many food trucks outside the village. Some residents say the authorities intend to starve the villagers until they submit, yet they profess their devotion to the Communist Party and speak of how the central government will soon come to their aid."]
["world/asia", "On the main road connecting Lufeng to Wukan, there was no sign of a police presence on Tuesday night. A police checkpoint that had been erected at one bridge outside Lufeng several days ago was no longer there. But on the outskirts of Wukan, villagers still manned barricades that are meant to keep back security forces. When foreign journalists traveling from Lufeng approached them near midnight, several villagers took the journalists into the heart of Wukan on the backs of motorcycles. Mr. Lin said the greatest concern of the villagers was their land: they charge that the village government and Lufeng authorities illegally sold the village\u2019s collectively owned farm and forest land to developers without their consent, and that money from the sales is unaccounted for. Mr. Lin said the issue would need to be discussed in further talks with officials. The anger of the last week involved a second but equally explosive issue: the death of a 42-year-old villager, Xue Jinbo, who was among 12 people chosen by villagers to negotiate a settlement to the land dispute. Mr. Xue died after being abducted on Dec. 9 with four other men, apparently at the behest of Lufeng police officials. The Lufeng police said that Mr. Xue and the four others were arrested and charged with protest-related crimes, but that Mr. Xue later died of a heart attack. A report by the state-run Xinhua news service said Mr. Xue had become ill after two days of interrogation in which he admitted to his crimes."]
["world/asia", "Mr. Xue\u2019s relatives, who were allowed to see but not photograph his body, say it bore signs of torture, including caked blood, bruises and a broken left thumb. Mr. Lin said the officials agreed on Wednesday morning to release the detainees that day or the next day and to turn over Mr. Xue\u2019s body soon. The officials also promised an investigation into the death, he said. The standoff between the village and outside authorities began when protesters furious over word of Mr. Xue\u2019s death mobbed the headquarters of Wukan\u2019s village committee. The last of the committee\u2019s nine members fled after thousands of protesters beat back an effort by the local police to retake the village. The villagers \u2014 once numbering 13,000, but now down to about 6,000, one protester said \u2014 have set up their own governing body and issued demands that their land be returned and that a new village committee be democratically elected. Outside authorities have responded by detaining two Wukan officials \u2014 the village Communist Party secretary, Xue Chang, and the head of the village administrative committee, Chun Shunyi \u2014 for interrogation by the party\u2019s disciplinary officials. The action is tantamount to arrest. Official statements also say that roughly 67 acres of village land, a tiny fraction of the amount sold, has been recovered. The reports do not indicate what was done with the property."]
["world/asia", "News of the Wukan protest has been all but banned from the Chinese media and Internet sites. But there were indications that word of the dispute was nevertheless spreading. Posts on Chinese microblog services reported protests in three other villages in Shanwei Prefecture, which includes Wukan, apparently over other land disputes. Three people were arrested Sunday in Guangzhou, a Guangdong Province metropolis, after a protest in sympathy with the Wukan villagers. Another microblog post on Tuesday, with photographs, described a violent clash between police officers and thousands of people in Haimen, a township in Shantou, a major Pacific coast city about 90 miles from Wukan. People in Wukan said Wednesday morning that Haimen\u2019s streets appeared quiet, but the riot police were still out in force. The Internet posts stated that the Shantou demonstrators, some of whom were hospitalized, were protesting plans to build a power plant, fearing that it would add to pollution and damage the local fishing industry. Other microblog reports told of related protests in two nearby villages."]

["sports/basketball", "A Sudden Demand for No. 98 Jerseys - The New York Times Jason Collins fell asleep Saturday night without a team. On Sunday, he became the Nets\u2019 most publicized player, the first openly gay athlete to play in an N.B.A. game, although one on a 10-day contract. On Monday, inquiries by those eager to buy a Nets jersey with Collins\u2019s name started to multiply. On Tuesday, Collins jerseys will go on sale at the N.B.A.\u2019s retail shop in Manhattan and at NBAstore.com. Collins\u2019s jersey number of choice is 98, in honor of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student from Wyoming who was murdered in 1998. But on Sunday, when the Nets acted quickly to get Collins in uniform for a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, they had to resort to a generic jersey the team travels with in case of emergencies. As a result, Collins wore No. 46 in the Nets\u2019 108-102 victory over the Lakers, a game in which he logged 11 minutes, grabbed two rebounds and finished with an impressive plus-8 for his time on the court. On Tuesday, Collins will get to have his first practice with his new teammates. On Wednesday, he will presumably be wearing a No. 98 uniform in Portland against the Trail Blazers. Vicky Picca, the N.B.A.\u2019s senior vice president for licensing and business affairs, used the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d Monday to describe the inquiries from people interested in buying something with Collins\u2019s name on it. On Tuesday, they can start making purchases, including T-shirts with Collins\u2019s name that will be available only online."]
["sports/basketball", "Fans will not yet be able to buy Collins apparel at the Nets Shop by Adidas, the official team store in Barclays Center. Barry Baum, the Nets\u2019 executive vice president and chief communications officer, said that historically, player-specific merchandise was not made available when a player was on a 10-day contract. Baum added that if, and when, a player became signed for the entire season \u2014 which could easily happen in Collins\u2019s case \u2014 his merchandise would go on sale at the team store and on the team\u2019s website. Although Adidas supplies both outlets with official merchandise, Picca said it was up to the Nets to decide when they wanted to begin selling certain apparel. Others are already trying to profit from Collins\u2019s popularity. Game-used Collins jerseys from his previous teams were on eBay on Monday afternoon, with prices listed as high as $335. Brian Ellner, a founding member of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit group that addresses homophobia in sports, said he believed there would be an \u201cenormous demand\u201d for Collins merchandise, although whether Collins remains with the Nets, and in the N.B.A., for the rest of the season will have a substantial impact on sales. Last week, when reports surfaced that Collins had recently worked out with the Nets, the team\u2019s general manager, Billy King, maintained that a potential Collins signing would not be \u201cabout marketing or anything like that,\u201d but would be based solely on whether Collins could help the team. That judgment is still to be made, although it is noteworthy that Collins played significant minutes in the fourth quarter Sunday night, when the game\u2019s outcome was still not decided."]

They are still within shouting range of a playoff berth \u2014 their professed goal \u2014 but are also in reach of a top draft pick. Choosing to pursue one or the other could have lasting effects for the organization, but in the short term, the rest of the Knicks\u2019 schedule will have a different meaning for those on the roster. The final six weeks of the season will be used to evaluate which players are good fits for the Knicks\u2019 offensive system \u2014 the triangle \u2014 Coach Jeff Hornacek said. So while the Knicks may try to win even if losing could benefit them more in the long run, the ultimate takeaway could be merely determining who should be back next season with the team, which has solidified its commitment to the triangle in the last week. \u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten better,\u201d Hornacek said. \u201cAs time goes on, we say: \u2018Can they get it? Are they getting better at it?\u2019 If they\u2019re not, then O.K., when the end of the year comes and we\u2019re having our discussions \u2014 \u2018Can this guy play this offense?\u2019 \u2014 we\u2019ll say yea or nay, or: \u2018He\u2019s getting it; he\u2019s getting better.\u2019 So I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of the evaluations this summer.\u201d"]
["sports/basketball", "Whether that has always been the plan is unclear, but Hornacek and players say the Knicks, who visit Orlando on Wednesday night, have practiced the triangle and used it more in games since the All-Star break. On Tuesday, as Derrick Rose cycled on a stationary bike and Carmelo Anthony practiced jump shots and pick-and-pops with the assistant coach Howard Eisley on one court, the rest of the Knicks finished practice with a full-court scrimmage on another court. Point guard Chasson Randle, signed by the Knicks on Monday, and the rookie Ron Baker are set to get more substantive looks the rest of the season now that the team has waived Brandon Jennings. And with Joakim Noah possibly out for the rest of the season because of a knee operation, Willy Hernangomez is now the starting center. While Randle and Baker were both undrafted, they may be better fits in the triangle than Jennings, whose style of play fit into an up-tempo system that Hornacek seemed to prefer earlier in the season. Jennings\u2019s release may have been a liberation; according to multiple reports Tuesday night, he was expected to sign with the Washington Wizards. \u201cYou could tell he wasn\u2019t himself,\u201d the Knicks\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis said. \u201cThis was probably the best thing for him. Just he loves basketball, he loves playing basketball, and he wasn\u2019t happy here.\u201d The triangle has stabilized the Knicks, at least for the last two games \u2014 each came down to the final possession \u2014 and Hornacek still hopes to play with pace, too. But the Knicks\u2019 top priority will be gauging which players can keep up."]
["arts", "Kara Walker Traces Slavery\u2019s Bitter Legacy With New Ways of Drawing - The New York Times Like most outstanding artists, Kara Walker is unrelenting. In a press statement for her latest show at Sikkema Jenkins & Co., she wrote in her familiar, mock-serious yet dead-serious tone that she was \u201ctired of \u2018having a voice\u2019 or worse \u2018being a role model\u2019 \u201d and of \u201cbeing a featured member of my racial group and/or gender niche.\u201d But Ms. Walker\u2019s desire to stand down from the demands of her particular brand of fame has not made her stand down in her art, which is as disturbing and challenging as ever, if not more so. Honing more insistently to her longtime theme \u2014 the bitter legacy of slavery in the United States \u2014 the works in this assured exhibition unequivocally enter new territory. Narratively, they land solidly where Ms. Walker has only lightly tread: the remorseless, racialized American present, which is suffused with the death rattle of white male domination and its multiple bigotries. Visually they find the artist returning fully to two dimensions after her triumphal public sculpture, \u201cA Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby,\u201d the monumental and vexatious sugarcoated woman-sphinx of 2014. Now she is pushing with new rigor at the boundaries of her primary medium and material \u2014 drawing and paper \u2014 merging collage, political cartoon and history painting, and this gives her story line more force."]
["arts", "The show is a brawl of works on paper that has as much the feeling of a studio visit as an exhibition. Coming in various shapes and sizes \u2014 worked with Sumi ink, charcoal or watercolor \u2014 the paper is cut, torn and collaged, sometimes to canvas or raw linen the shade of tobacco, often with quantities of black paint and sometimes bits of color. The show\u2019s centerpiece is the enormous \u201cChrist\u2019s Entry into Journalism\u201d (2017) an 11 by 18 foot collage crowded with over 80 ink drawings of heads and figures. Its title echoes numerous historical depictions of \u201cChrist\u2019s Entry into Jerusalem,\u201d the biblical event preceding his betrayal, trial, death and resurrection; but perhaps journalism\u2019s death and resurrection is the main point. The images here are not exclusively contemporary \u2014 note a man resembling the abolitionist Frederick Douglass in the lower left corner \u2014 but they implicate current events. Across the top of the piece a rebus depicts a rope salesman, a white farmer with a noose, a lynched figure and a Ku Klux Klan member whose parted robe reveals a figure in a suit and an extra-long tie who could be construed as the current occupant of the White House."]
["arts", "More prominent images evoke Civil Rights protesters; a Confederate flag and an arm raised in a Nazi salute; a policeman in riot gear pursuing a protester with a turkey leg and a cellphone; and Batman, carrying a figure wrapped as a mummy whose swollen black face may or may not refer to Emmett Till. At the center, a bare-chested black man raises his chained hands prayerfully. Nearby the severed head of a young black man in a hoodie is seen, upright, on a tray carried by a white woman, like Salome with the head of John the Baptist. More than ever, Ms. Walker\u2019s work piles personages, events and possible interpretations before us, daring us to face her reality \u2014 and ours. Ms. Walker emerged in the mid-1990s with incendiary works set adamantly and slyly in the past that were frequently criticized as politically incorrect for caricaturing slavery in the antebellum South. Scaling up the demure 19th-century genre of the black-paper silhouette, she brought to elegant, repellent life an unending stream of vicious master-slave narratives \u2014 a continuum of violence, abuse and violation that consumed and corrupted almost all parties, regardless of age or race. Antic, profane and riveting, these mural-like scenes replayed history as farce and masqueraded tragedy as depraved comedy. They revealed the inevitable psychic corruption of humans owning humans, brought out the sexual component of oppression in any form and implied a country still shaped by the original sin of slavery."]
["arts", "Ms. Walker\u2019s visual efforts have generally been aided by a sardonic ventriloquism that recycles 19th-century elocutions. The title of her current show runs 198 words and unspools in the cadences of a sideshow barker: \u201cSikkema Jenkins and Co. is Compelled to Present the Most Astounding and Important Painting show of the fall Art Show viewing season!.\u201d And so on, as if to account for all possible reactions: \u201cCollectors of Fine Art will Flock\u2026,\u201d \u201cScholars will Study and Debate\u2026,\u201d \u201cArt historians will wonder\u2026,\u201d \u201cCritics will shake their heads...\u201d \u201cThe Final President of the United States will visibly wince.\u201d One sentence is especially telling: \u201cStudents of Color will eye her work suspiciously and exercise their free right to Culturally Annihilate her on social media.\u201d Ms. Walker knows that with artistic reputation, what goes up must come down. She also knows that political correctness has returned, with various factions of the righteous trying to dictate what artists and museums should and should not show. (Consider the recent examples of Dana Schutz at the Whitney Biennial and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and Sam Durant at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.) Ms. Walker\u2019s work might be seen as a three-pronged attempt to wreak havoc with racism, language \u2014 and drawing itself. Her signature black silhouettes, which have transferred well to printmaking, book illustrations and animated films, reappear, and Ms. Walker sometimes struggles to refresh them. She succeeds in \u201cSlaughter of the Innocents (They Might be Guilty of Something),\u201d where the black silhouette cutouts migrate to a large, seemingly whitewashed slab of canvas."]
["arts", "But she really cuts loose with the big collages and their rough-edged images, which recur in two other large collages, \u201cU.S.A. Idioms\u201d and \u201cThe Pool Party of Sardanapalus (after Delacroix, Kienholz).\u201d Measuring some 10 by 11 feet, this last work is notable for a group of young black women in two-piece bathing suits; they bring to mind a black teenager at a pool party in McKinney, Tex., who was thrown to the ground and restrained by a white policeman. By cutting and pasting various images, Ms. Walker is able to convincingly combine not only different times and histories, but also numerous drawing styles, which gives her art a new freedom and toughness that it has needed. Especially tough is a collage-painting titled \u201cSpook,\u201d one of three outstanding raw linen works. Placed near the gallery\u2019s front door, it centers on a cut-out ink drawing of a black woman pleasuring herself in a dark woodland haunted by cutouts that contrast various threats: a snake, a bat, a white man with a noose. The surface is thick with tenderly applied black paint. A different kind of combination of sensuous and tough is achieved in \u201cDredging the Quagmire (Bottomless Pit),\u201d a triptych in which an assortment of figures, some pale as ghosts, sink into a vast black swamp beneath black trees. It is both morbid and mordant and contains some of Ms. Walker\u2019s most ravishing ink drawing. Other works seem almost tossed off. A poignant example is an all-black oval canvas titled \u201cStorm Ryder\u201d and collaged with pieces of torn paper. One scrap gives a glimpse of a storm-tossed ship reminiscent of Albert Pinkham Ryder. Others convey the wise words of the subtitle: \u201cYou Must Hate Black People as Much as You Hate Yourself.\u201d She seems to be saying that bigotry starts with unexamined self-hatred."]

["business/global", "Europe's Small Airports Face Challenges - The New York Times PARIS \u2014 For the first time in 16 years as managing director of Linz Airport in northern Austria, Gerhard Kunesch teamed up recently with his local chamber of commerce for help in securing new business. Normally Mr. Kunesch deals one-to-one with potential partners, approaching airline executives with offers and pitches. But after years of declining passenger numbers in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, he decided he needed to try another tack. Apparently, it worked: Five flights a day now depart from Linz for Vienna, instead of three. \u201cWe are a very small airport,\u201d Mr. Kunesch said in an interview. \u201cWe realized that we had to build partnerships and form alliances.\u201d Now, the success of that approach is redefining Linz Airport\u2019s marketing strategy. Mr. Kunesch said he planned to hire a new employee in August to act as a liaison between the airport and the partnerships that he hopes to develop with tourism operators and local government offices. Together, these organizations can pool their resources and focus jointly on business development. Linz is not alone in trying new tactics. Europe\u2019s small airports, those serving five million passengers a year or fewer, are facing huge challenges. With European economies flat-lining in the aftermath of the financial crisis, small airports have struggled to grow, and many are still losing passengers."]
["business/global", "On average, their passenger traffic has grown just 1.6 percent a year since 2008, compared with an industry average of 7.3 percent; last year 45 percent of small airports actually lost traffic, according to a presentation given at a regional airports conference in Lyon in April. Now, they are responding. \u201cThe airports used to sit and wait for the airlines to come to them,\u201d said Olivier Jankovec, director general of Airports Council International Europe, a group that represents more than 450 airports in 44 European countries. \u201cBut this is no longer the case. You have to go out and lure the airlines to come to serve your destination.\u201d ACI Europe represents airports of all sizes, from the largest, like London Heathrow, to the smallest, like Linz. Together they handle 90 percent of commercial air traffic in Europe \u2014 over 1.5 billion passengers, 18 million tons of freight and more than 20 million aircraft movements each year. Out of this vast traffic, about 400 small airports together account for more than a third of the Continent\u2019s passenger traffic, ACI Europe says. Yet more than half of these airports are operating at a loss, the group says. Perhaps the biggest cause of economic instability for small airports is their volatile relationship with low-cost carriers. Small airports lack the capacity to serve more than a handful of airlines, so they often become highly dependent on those few for revenue. The carriers, however, are under no obligation to guarantee their business. That can leave airports like Glasgow Prestwick, in Scotland, in the greater Glasgow urban area, financially vulnerable. Since Wizz Air pulled out in March, the airport\u2019s sole source of commercial business has been Ryanair."]
["business/global", "Still, while their small size creates greater economic pressures for these airports, it also allows for more innovative approaches to recovery. Often, just a handful of people can decide to employ new strategies, like introducing a social media campaign, without having to gain the approval of an entire board or go through a lengthy review process. \u201cWorking at a certain scale allows the company to be more nimble,\u201d Robert O\u2019Meara, director of media and communication at ACI Europe, said in an e-mail. A small airport, he said, \u201ccan respond quicker to challenges and opportunities, and experiment a bit in the way it promotes itself.\u201d New marketing tactics often aim directly at the passenger rather than the airline. Many airports, like Krakow Airport, in Poland, work to foster customers\u2019 loyalty through reward programs offering prizes for frequent visitors, like free or discounted parking. Others, like Lyon-Saint Exup\u00e9ry Airport, have gotten even more creative. Five years ago, the airport developed \u201cLe Club Imagine,\u201d a working group that asks employees to suggest new services. Over 60 projects have been implemented to date, including a new Android app for travelers and an on-site farmers\u2019 market. But while their small size may facilitate creative marketing, it also exposes these airports to larger financial risks relative to their size, particularly when it comes to attracting low-cost carriers. A common incentive is to reduce landing fees or even eliminate them altogether, but some airports go to even greater lengths, financing the construction of new infrastructure facilities in the hope of attracting traffic."]
["business/global", "Sometimes, the investment pays off \u2014 a year after opening a \u20ac5.5 million, or $7.3 million, low-cost airline terminal in 2010, Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport in france had a 9 percent increase in passenger traffic. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t: After an investment of about $200 million, Castell\u00f3n airport in southern Spain has not seen a commercial flight since its 2011 opening, according to AirportWatch, an organization that opposes \u201cunsustainable aviation expansion.\u201d Despite the economic challenges and risks, advocates of these airports say they need to be judged not just on their own profitability but more broadly on the value they bring to their catchment areas. Not only do they create jobs onsite and in the surrounding areas, but they help to expose neighboring communities to global trade. \u201cRegional airports are a really essential infrastructure because they\u2019re really the ones that put your local community on the map,\u201d said Mr. Jankovec, of the airports council. \u201cThey\u2019re the engines of economic development.\u201d Still, other business analysts question that view. Andreas Wald, a professor of management and strategy at the European Business School in Paris, said that trains and roads could bring in as much business at a fraction of the cost. \u201cIf there\u2019s a new hotel or whatever \u2014 any kind of new tourism infrastructure \u2014 the same effect will show up,\u201d Mr. Wald said. The key question, he said, is whether an airport investment \u201cis sustainable \u2014 and something which is really necessary for these different regions.\u201d"]
["business/global", "Mr. Wald argues that location is the vital ingredient. The small airports worth sustaining are the ones that serve the most isolated cities and towns, he said. For example, Kristiansand Airport, in southern Norway, has experienced steady growth of about 6 percent a year as an international trade gateway for its region. In the more densely populated and central regions of Western Europe, in contrast, airports like Kassel Calden in Germany can feel redundant. The newly built regional airport opened in April, only 70 kilometers, or 43 miles, from the existing Paderborn Lippstadt Airport and has since had a tough time attracting users. Regardless of the challenges, managers of small airports still say that their size is one of their biggest assets. Charles Buchanan, chief executive of Manston Airport, in southeastern England, plays up that point. \u201cIt\u2019s 50 meters from the car park to the check-in desk. And another 50 meters from the check-in desk to the aircraft,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a radically different experience to the miles and miles you have to travel in major hubs,\u201d he added. \u201c It\u2019s flying how flying should be.\u201d"]
["sports", "U.S. Soccer Will Support Blatter Rival in FIFA Election - The New York Times ZURICH \u2014 At dawn on Wednesday, Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, woke with a start, his phone buzzing on the desk of his room at a luxury hotel here. A police raid was quietly going on in the halls around him, and some of Mr. Gulati\u2019s closest professional colleagues \u2014 a few of them his friends \u2014 were being arrested on various charges related to corruption. The calls and texts did not stop for hours. Mr. Gulati, who is also a member of FIFA\u2019s powerful executive committee, said his emotions were mixed as he read and talked about the news. \u201cShock and disappointment were first,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, very soon after, came anger.\u201d That anger, he added, only confirmed a decision he made months ago: On Friday, when one delegate from each of the 209 associations that are members of FIFA casts a vote for the next FIFA president, Mr. Gulati will instruct the United States delegate to vote against the longtime incumbent, Sepp Blatter, and vote instead for the only other candidate, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan. Mr. Gulati, in an interview here Thursday, said he knows that doing so might have repercussions for U.S. Soccer in the future, especially if Mr. Blatter, as expected, wins a fifth term as FIFA president. Anti-American sentiment is not unusual in international sports, and the involvement of the Justice Department in the arrests will not help the United States\u2019 image."]
["sports", "Under Mr. Blatter, FIFA has often operated with a culture of \u201cretribution,\u201d as Prince Ali once put it, which could make it more difficult for U.S. Soccer to find allies. But Mr. Gulati has decided that voting in favor of change at FIFA is the most important priority, even if it might hurt the United States in its bids to host a World Cup. It is not a decision he undertook lightly \u2014 he said he discussed it with a few U.S. Soccer board members before backing Prince Ali\u2019s bid \u2014 but it is one he said was critical. \u201cWould I like to see the United States host a World Cup in the future?\u201d Mr. Gulati said. \u201cThe answer is, of course, yes. But for me, and for U.S. soccer, better governance and more integrity at Concacaf and FIFA are far more important than hosting any international soccer tournament.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m sure there are some people who would disagree with that decision and would prioritize things differently. But this is how we feel, and we are doing what we think is right. If being on the right side of issues costs us from hosting a World Cup in the future, that would be unfortunate. But we are prepared to deal with that.\u201d The hosting rights for the 2026 World Cup \u2014 the 2018 tournament will be in Russia, and the 2022 event is scheduled for Qatar \u2014 will be awarded in 2017. It is difficult to predict how FIFA will look by then, but Mr. Gulati is hopeful that Prince Ali, instead of Mr. Blatter, will be leading something close to a wholesale change in the organization."]
["sports", "Mr. Gulati also said that the Canadian soccer federation would join him in backing Prince Ali, who has campaigned largely on a platform of reform. When it was noted that Prince Ali is considered a significant underdog to Mr. Blatter, who has held the FIFA presidency since 1998, Mr. Gulati shrugged. \u201cBeing on the wrong side of an election result \u2014 if that\u2019s what happens \u2014 is not necessarily being on the wrong side,\u201d he said. Wednesday\u2019s events only strengthened Mr. Gulati\u2019s determination, he said. As he watched Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s news conference \u2014 in which she and other government officials detailed the widespread corruption their investigation had uncovered \u2014 Mr. Gulati found himself shaking his head over and over.

["us", "Hurricane Katrina Slams Into Gulf Coast; Dozens Are Dead - The New York Times NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 29 - Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force at daybreak on Monday, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but inundating parts of the city and heaping damage on neighboring Mississippi, where it killed dozens, ripped away roofs and left coastal roads impassable. Officials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50 alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings. Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway. Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center. The storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record. In New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter."]
["us", "Some of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable. \"It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,\" Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news conference \"It's a terrible storm.\" President Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses. In Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas. The governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew. Hurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 -- the most dangerous storm -- to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans officials said the storm's slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat. The city is below sea level, and there had been predictions that the historic French Quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water."]
["us", "Still, no one was finding much comfort here, with 100 m.p.h. winds and water surges of up to 15 feet.

Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. \"I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don't even know what the worst is.\" Preliminary damage estimates from the hurricane -- which raked across southern Florida last week as a Category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and making its run at the Gulf Coast -- ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier -- with nearly $21 billion in insured losses. Beyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds, Hurricane Katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region. Both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached. Since Friday, oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has been cut by 3.1 million barrels. Closing the casinos cost Mississippi $400,000 to $500,000 a day in lost tax revenue alone, and Mr. Barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos."]
["us", "The storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown. On the southern shore of the lake, entire neighborhoods of one-story homes were flooded to the rooflines, with nearby off-ramps for Interstate 10 looking like boat ramps amid the waves. Along the lake were snapped telephone poles, trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads. In one cabin, a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi. They had lost power like everyone else in the area. Windows were blown off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending chards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out despite torrential rain, some ignited, the authorities said, by residents who lighted candles after the electricity went out. The storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region, and officials in New Orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks. Two nuclear plants near the path of Hurricane Katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage, and a third shut down on Saturday, in anticipation of the hurricane, according to Entergy Nuclear, which owns all three. The extent of damage to the plant that shut down, Waterford, 20 miles west of New Orleans, was still unknown late Monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look, said Diane Park, a spokeswoman."]

Ms. Blanco said Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany Parishes had been \"devastated by high winds and floodwaters.\" In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40,000 homes, too, were flooded. Parish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs. Officials estimated 80 percent of New Orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate. But in areas that had been expecting less damage, officials were worried -- and annoyed -- that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm. In Plaquemines and Terrebonne Parishes, south and west of the city, officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats. \"My biggest concern is the loss of life,\" said State Senator Walter J. Boasso. \"We have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics, and I don't know if we will get to them fast enough.\" In Mississippi, Mr. Barbour said many people suffered from what he called \"hurricane fatigue,\" deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared. \"We pray that those people are O.K.,\" he said. \"But we don't know.\" In Diamondhead, Miss., Don Haller and his 17-year-old son, Don Jr., were left clinging to the remains of their house when a 23-foot surge of water hit it, flexing the roof like a deck of cards."]
["us", "They had decided against evacuating, Mr. Haller said, judging the storm \"just a lot of rain.\" \"We rode the house,\" Mr. Haller said, emerging from the waters here, his son carrying their dachshund, Kuddles. Mr. Barbour said casinos along the coast near Biloxi and Gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet. But casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage, he said, because U.S. 90 had \"essentially been destroyed.\" Along the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open. The lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama were evacuated on Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile and Mobile Bay as the hurricane progressed. Downtown Mobile, which is right on the bay, was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the Mobile Museum. Water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters, and large, heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets. The main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding, causing concerns that they, too, would be flooded, at least in the main floors. And as power and phone lines went down, evacuees were getting restless."]

He drove with his wife, daughter and four friends to Mobile; with roads clogged with other residents fleeing, what is normally a three-hour drive took 12. By Monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home. \"If I was home, I would've went on a roof for two days just like everybody else,\" said Susan Weir, Mr. Weir's wife, said. \"I'd rather be in that situation than here, honestly. This is expensive and I've only got a credit card with a $2,000 limit.\" At the Ramada Hotel in downtown Mobile, Edith Frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned. \"He left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house,\" said Mrs. Frieson, who lives on Dauphin Island, a narrow barrier island south of Mobile. The island was already flooding on Sunday afternoon. Like most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm. The center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward Jackson, Miss. But state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one, causing a wide swath of damage, and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks."]
["us", "In Louisiana, Ms. Blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back. \"The roads are flooded, the power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down,\" she said. \"Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home,\" she continued. \"If you evacuated and you're in a shelter, if you're with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe.\" Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed. \"Be careful,\" Mr. Brown said, standing next to the governor at a news conference. \"Don't get in that water. Watch for downed power lines. If you're going to use a chainsaw, know how to use a chainsaw. If you're going to have a generator, know how to exercise and operate the generator. Be very, very careful. The storm is not over.\" Mr. Brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked. Even before the hurricane hit the New Orleans area, FEMA had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. It even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals."]

For many supporters of the street protests that toppled Mr. Yanukovych, the elections were envisioned as a final step in transforming the government from an opaque kleptocracy beholden to the president, his oligarch backers and the Kremlin, to a transparent, reform-minded, pro-Western administration with a Parliament accountable to the people. The elections are also crucial to the United States and its European allies, which have staked enormous political and financial capital on Ukraine\u2019s future. Events here, however, suggest that transformation may take a lot longer. Ukrainian politics have long been dominated by big business interests, mainly the industrial titans known as oligarchs, who finance the campaigns of parties and candidates in exchange for influence within the presidential administration and for control of some seats in Parliament, called the Verkhovna Rada.

Mr. Dovhyi tried to win a seat in Parliament from Kiev in 2012 but failed in part because the allegations against him were well known by city voters.

Some ancient descriptions did note color, as when the ancient Greeks recognized that their \u201cbarbaric\u201d northern neighbors, Scythians and Celts, had lighter skin than Greeks considered normal. Most ancient peoples defined population differences culturally, not physically, and often regarded lighter people as less civilized.

It has much to teach everyone, including whiteness experts, but it is accessible and breezy, its coverage broad and therefore necessarily superficial."]
["books/review", "The modern intellectual history of whiteness began among the 18th-century German scholars who invented racial \u201cscience.\u201d Johann Joachim Winckelmann made the ancient Greeks his models of beauty by imagining them white-skinned; he may even have suppressed his own (correct) suspicion that their statues, though copied by the Romans in white marble, had originally been painted. The Dutchman Petrus Camper calculated the proportions and angles of the ideal face and skull, and produced a scale that awarded a perfect rating to the head of a Greek god and ranked Europeans as the runners-up, earning 80 out of 100. The Englishman Charles White collected skulls that he arranged from lowest to highest degree of perfection. He did not think he was seeing the gradual improvement of the human species, but assumed rather the polygenesis theory: the different races arose from separate divine \u00adcreations and were designed with a range of quality. The modern concept of a Caucasian race, which students my age were taught in school, came from Johann Friedrich Blumenbach of G\u00f6ttingen, the most influential of this generation of race scholars. Switching from skulls to skin, he divided humans into five races by color \u2014 white, yellow, copper, tawny, and tawny-black to jet-black \u2014 but he ascribed these differences to climate. Still convinced that people of the Caucasus were the paragons of beauty, he placed residents of North Africa and India in the Caucasian category, sliding into a linguistic analysis based on the common derivation of Indo-European languages. That category, Painter notes, soon slipped free of any geographic or linguistic moorings and became a quasi-\u00adscientific term for a race known as \u201cwhite.\u201d"]
["books/review", "Some great American heroes, notably Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, absorbed Blumenbach\u2019s influence but relabeled the categories of white superiority. They adopted the Saxons as their ideal, imagining Americans as direct and unalloyed descendants of the English, later including the Germans. In general, Western labels for racial superiority moved thus: Caucasian \u2192 Saxon \u2192 Teutonic \u2192 Nordic \u2192 Aryan \u2192 white/Anglo. The spread of evolutionary theory required a series of theoretical shifts, to cope with changing understandings of what is heritable. When hereditary thought produced eugenics, the effort to breed superior human beings, it relied mostly on inaccurate genetics. Nevertheless, eugenic \u201cscience\u201d became authoritative from the late 19th century through the 1930s. Eugenics gave rise to laws in at least 30 states authorizing forced sterilization of the ostensibly feeble-minded and the hereditarily criminal. Painter cites an estimate of 65,000 sterilized against their will by 1968, after which a combined feminist and civil rights campaign succeeded in radically restricting forced sterilization. While blacks and American Indians were disproportionately victimized, intelligence testing added many immigrants and others of \u201cinferior stock,\u201d predominantly Appalachian whites, to the rolls of the surgically sterilized."]
["books/review", "In the long run, the project of measuring \u201cintelligence\u201d probably did more than eugenics to stigmatize and hold back the nonwhite. Researchers gave I.Q. tests to 1,750,000 recruits in World War I and found that the average mental age, for those 18 and over, was 13.08 years. That experiment in mass testing failed owing to the Army\u2019s insistence that even the lowest ranked usually became model soldiers. But I.Q. testing achieved success in driving the anti-immigration movement. The tests allowed calibrated rankings of Americans of different ancestries \u2014 the English at the top, Poles on the bottom. Returning to head measurements, other researchers computed with new categories the proportion of different \u201cblood\u201d in people of different races: Belgians were 60 percent Nordic (the superior European race) and 40 percent Alpine, while the Irish were 30 percent Nordic and 70 percent Mediterranean (the inferior European race). Sometimes politics produced immediate changes in these supposedly objective findings: World War I caused the downgrading of Germans from heavily Nordic to heavily Alpine. Painter points out, but without adequate discussion, that the adoration of whiteness became particularly problematic for women, as pale blue-eyed blondes became, like so many unattainable desires, a reminder of what was second-class about the rest of us. Among the painfully comic absurdities that racial science produced was the \u201cbeauty map\u201d constructed by Francis Galton around the turn of the 20th century: he classified people as good, medium or bad; he categorized those he saw by using pushpins and thus demonstrated that London ranked highest and Aberdeen lowest in average beauty."]
["books/review", "Rankings of intelligence and beauty supported escalating anti-Catholicism and \u00adanti-Semitism in early-20th-century America. Both prejudices racialized non-Protestant groups. But Painter \u00admisses some crucial regional differences. While Jews and Italians were nonwhite in the East, they had long been white in San Francisco, where the racial \u201cinferiors\u201d were the Chinese. Although the United States census categorized \u00adMexican-Americans as white through 1930, census enumerators in the Southwest, working from a different racial under\u00adstanding, ignored those instructions and marked them \u201cM\u201d for Mexican. In the same period, anarchist or socialist beliefs became a sign of racial inferiority, a premise strengthened by the presence of many immigrants and Jews among early-20th-century radicals. Whiteness thus became a method of stigmatizing dissenting ideas, a marker of ideological respectability; Painter should have investigated this phenomenon further. Also missing from the book is an analysis of the all-important question: Who benefits and how from the imprimatur of whiteness? Political elites and employers of low-wage labor, to choose just two groups, actively policed the boundaries of whiteness. But I cannot fault Nell Painter\u2019s choices \u2014 omissions to keep a book widely readable. Often, scholarly interpretation is transmitted through textbooks that oversimplify and even bore their readers with vague generalities. Far better for a large audience to learn about whiteness from a distinguished scholar in an insightful and lively exposition."]

["us", "2 Blasts at Boston Marathon Kill at Least 3 and Injure More Than 100 - The New York Times BOSTON \u2014 Two powerful bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday afternoon, killing three people, including an 8-year-old child, and injuring more than 100, as one of this city\u2019s most cherished rites of spring was transformed from a scene of cheers and sweaty triumph to one of screams and carnage. Almost three-quarters of the 23,000 runners who participated in the race had already crossed the finish line when a bomb that had apparently been placed in a garbage can exploded around 2:50 p.m. in a haze of smoke amid a crowd of spectators on Boylston Street, just off Copley Square in the heart of the city. Thirteen seconds later, another bomb exploded several hundred feet away. Pandemonium erupted as panicked runners and spectators scattered, and rescue workers rushed in to care for the dozens of maimed and injured, some of whom lost legs in the blast, witnesses said. The F.B.I. took the lead role in the investigation on Monday night, and Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Boston office, described the inquiry at a news conference as \u201ca criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation.\u201d The reverberations were felt far outside the city, with officials in New York and Washington stepping up security at important locations. Near the White House, the Secret Service cordoned off Pennsylvania Avenue out of what one official described as \u201can abundance of caution.\u201d"]
["us", "President Obama, speaking at the White House, vowed to bring those responsible for the blasts to justice. \u201cWe will get to the bottom of this,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will find who did this, and we will find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.\u201d Mr. Obama did not refer to the attacks as an act of terrorism, and he cautioned people from \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d based on incomplete information. But a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity afterward, said, \u201cAny event with multiple explosive devices \u2014 as this appears to be \u2014 is clearly an act of terror, and will be approached as an act of terror.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d the official added, \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know who carried out this attack, and a thorough investigation will have to determine whether it was planned and carried out by a terrorist group, foreign or domestic.\u201d Some runners were approaching the end of the 26.2-mile race when the two blasts, in rapid succession, sent them running away from the finish line. \u201cThe first one went off, I thought it was a big celebratory thing, and I just kept going,\u201d recalled Jarrett Sylvester, 26, a runner from East Boston, who said it had sounded like a cannon blast. \u201cAnd then the second one went off, and I saw debris fly in the air. And I realized it was a bomb at that point. And I just took off and ran in the complete opposite direction.\u201d"]
["us", "There were conflicting reports about how many devices there were. One law enforcement official said there had been four: the two that exploded at the marathon and two others that were disabled by the police. The official said that the devices appeared to have been made with black powder and ball bearings, but that investigators were unsure how the two that exploded had been set off. It was unclear Monday evening who might be responsible for the blast. Although investigators said that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen who was injured in the blast, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was in custody. Some law enforcement officials noted that the blasts came at the start of a week that has sometimes been seen as significant for radical American antigovernment groups: it was the April 15 deadline for filing taxes, and Patriots\u2019 Day in Massachusetts, the start of a week that has seen violence in the past. April 19 is the anniversary of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The explosive devices used in the attacks on Monday were similar in size to the device used in the 1996 attack at the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta but were not nearly as large as the one used in Oklahoma City. In the Atlanta attack, a pipe bomb was detonated near pedestrians, killing 2 and injuring more than 100 \u2014 similar numbers to Monday\u2019s attack."]
["us", "The attack in Oklahoma City was far larger because the perpetrator used a truck packed with thousands of pounds of explosives. The device killed more than 150 people. The attack on Monday occurred in areas that had been largely cleared of vehicles for the marathon. Without vehicles to pack explosives into, the perpetrators would have been forced to rely on much smaller devices. Officials stressed that they had no suspects in the attack. The Saudi man, who was interviewed at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, had been seen running from the scene of the first explosion, a person briefed on preliminary developments in the investigation said on Monday afternoon. A law enforcement official said later Monday that the man, was in the United States on a student visa and came under scrutiny because of his injuries, his proximity to the blasts and his nationality \u2014 but added that he was not known to federal authorities and that his role in the attack, if any, was unclear. The explosions brought life in Boston to a halt. Police officials effectively closed a large part of the Back Bay neighborhood, which surrounds the blast site; some transit stops were closed; planes were briefly grounded at Boston Logan International Airport and the Boston Symphony Orchestra canceled its Monday night concert. A Boston Celtics game scheduled for Tuesday was also canceled."]
["us", "Boston was bracing for a heightened law enforcement presence on Tuesday, with its transit riders subject to random checks of their backpacks and bags, and many streets in the center of the city likely to be closed to traffic as the investigation continues. Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday night that \u201cthe city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.\u201d Boston\u2019s police commissioner, Ed Davis, urged people to stay off the streets. \u201cWe\u2019re recommending to people that they stay home, that if they\u2019re in hotels in the area that they return to their rooms, and that they don\u2019t go any place and congregate in large crowds,\u201d he said at an afternoon news conference. It had begun as a perfect day for the Boston Marathon, one of running\u2019s most storied events, with blue skies and temperatures just shy of 50 degrees. The race typically draws half a million spectators. And long after the world-class runners had finished \u2014 the men\u2019s race was won by Lelisa Desisa Benti of Ethiopia, who finished it in 2 hours, 10 minutes and 22 seconds \u2014 the sidewalks of Back Bay were still thick with spectators cheering on friends and relatives as they loped, exhausted, toward the finish line. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, was running in the marathon with her father and was nearing the finish line when the explosions shook the street."]
["us", "\u201cThe police were trying to keep us back, but I told them that I was a physician and they let me through,\u201d she recalled in an interview. First she performed CPR on one woman. \u201cShe was on the ground, she wasn\u2019t breathing, her legs were pretty much gone,\u201d she said, adding that she feared that the woman had not survived. Then she tried to help a woman with an injury in her groin area, and a man who had lost his foot. Dr. Stavas said she had applied a tourniquet to the man\u2019s leg with someone\u2019s belt. \u201cHe was likely in shock,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018I\u2019m O.K., doctor, I\u2019m O.K.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThen ambulances started coming in by the dozen,\u201d she said. The blast was so powerful that it blew out shop windows and damaged a window on the third floor of the Central Library in Copley Square, which was closed to the public for Patriots\u2019 Day. A number of people were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Alasdair Conn, the hospital\u2019s chief of emergency services \u2014 and several had lost their legs. \u201cThis is like a bomb explosion we hear about in Baghdad or Israel or other tragic points in the world,\u201d Dr. Conn said. Several children were among the 10 patients who were brought to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, including a 2-year-old boy with a head injury who was admitted to the medical/surgical intensive care unit."]
["us", "The police faced another problem as they tried to secure the blast scene: many spectators dropped their backpacks and bags as they scattered to safety, and investigators had to treat each abandoned bag as a potential bomb. There were bomb scares at area hotels. At one point in the afternoon, Boston police officials said that they feared that a fire at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum could have been related to the marathon bombs, but they later said it seemed to be unrelated. The Boston police said that they were getting numerous reports of suspicious packages. Asked if they had found all the explosive devices, Mr. Davis, the police commissioner, urged citizens to remain alert and said he was \u201cnot prepared to say we\u2019re at ease at this time.\u201d"]
["world/asia", "Drone Attack in Pakistan Kills a Haqqani Leader - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 A C.I.A. drone strike on Thursday killed a high-level commander in the Haqqani network, the militant group that has been the largest killer of American troops in Afghanistan, American officials said. The officials said they had confirmed the death of Janbaz Zadran, who has often been described as the third-ranking leader of the Haqqani network, near Miram Shah in North Waziristan, part of Pakistan\u2019s tribal area. \u201cHis death in Miram Shah makes him the most senior Haqqani leader in Pakistan to be taken off the battlefield,\u201d said an American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the nominally secret drone program. Two missiles hit a house and a vehicle, killing Mr. Zadran and three other people, according to Pakistani officials and local news reports. A second drone strike in South Waziristan killed three people, the officials said. Mr. Zadran, also known as Jamil, was an important link between Haqqani fighters in Afghanistan, who are allied with the Taliban, and the network\u2019s hub in Miram Shah, where it has established a sort of ministate that includes tax collectors, courts and schools to train Islamic fighters. He was the chief organizer of the supply chain across the border for weapons and other goods, according to experts on the network."]
["world/asia", "Mr. Zadran served as a top aide to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the network\u2019s operational commander and the son of the group\u2019s patriarch, Jalaluddin Haqqani. In the 1980s, the elder Mr. Haqqani was part of a coalition of Islamist militias, backed by the C.I.A., that fought the Soviet Army in Afghanistan; in recent years, however, his group has become a major target for the agency\u2019s campaign of strikes using missiles fired from drones. A study last year by the New America Foundation, a Washington research group, said that Mr. Zadran was in charge of Haqqani network finances as well as weapons acquisition. While not an experienced military leader, he came from the Haqqanis\u2019 home village of Srani in Paktia Province in Afghanistan and was among their most trusted deputies, the study said. Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert and one of the authors of the New America paper, said that while the drone strikes in Pakistan had been quite effective against Al Qaeda, whose leaders are mainly non-Pakistanis, they may be less devastating for a group like the Haqqani network. \u201cThe Haqqanis have deep local roots, so they just have a deeper bench,\u201d Mr. Fishman said. The Haqqani network has been at the heart of recent tension between the United States and Pakistan. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, described the network last month as a \u201cveritable arm\u201d of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, a remark that other American officials later toned down."]

Another became a kitchen designer in Manhattan for an Italian company and is setting up his own general contracting firm. A third started driving a taxi to help pay for college. They are among more than 291,000 immigrants who have been granted temporary reprieves from deportation under a program President Obama announced last June. The program, which is open to young people who were brought to the United States as children and are here illegally, allows them to obtain a Social Security number, apply for driver\u2019s licenses and work. As Congress considers an immigration package, with debate in the Senate beginning this week, the program\u2019s impact suggests how the lives of the nation\u2019s 11 million immigrants in the country illegally might be transformed by a broader overhaul. In interviews, those who have received the reprieve, known as deferred action, said it had changed things in numerous ways, from the practical to the emotional, the mundane to the profound. Many talked about being able to walk out their front door for the first time without fear that a wrong turn could lead to deportation proceedings. \u201cI\u2019m a human here in this country now; I didn\u2019t feel like I was before,\u201d said Luis Rey Ramirez, 26, a Mexican graphic designer who grew up in the Bronx and was granted the deferral in April. \u201cI feel like I can just navigate this country easier in a legal way, in a way that I can contribute.\u201d"]
["nyregion", "Yet the young immigrants\u2019 elation is tempered by concerns over the program\u2019s future. Should immigration legislation fail and the next president cancel the policy, the recipients might lose their privileges and once again face the possibility of deportation. In the meantime, the program does not grant them permanent residency, and the reprieve from deportation is temporary, subject to renewal after two years. It may also be revoked should a recipient commit a crime or otherwise violate the terms of the program. A federal official said \u201conly a handful\u201d of immigrants had had their deferred action terminated. Last week, in a vote along party lines, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives adopted an amendment to a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would shut down the program. Some opponents of the program have gone to court. In a case in Dallas, a federal district judge said in a ruling in April that he was doubtful about the program\u2019s legality, suggesting that the president had overstepped his authority and that only Congress could approve such a temporary reprieve from deportation. The case was brought by 10 immigration agents, who are being represented by Kris W. Kobach, a Republican who is the Kansas secretary of state and a prominent voice in the movement against an immigration overhaul. The judge, Reed O\u2019Connor, postponed issuing an injunction and asked both sides to submit more information."]
["nyregion", "Still, whatever the fate of the program, it has already demonstrated the political power of the immigration issue. Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to approve deferred action has been widely credited with helping to rally the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election. While mindful of the threats to the program, many of those who have already been approved said they were pressing ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like an inspiration to get things done faster, to really go ahead and take advantage of the status, because in reality, we don\u2019t know if it will be renewed,\u201d said Jasniya Sanchez, 26, a Mexican immigrant. Ms. Sanchez was hired as academic coordinator for Qualitas of Life Foundation, which offers financial advice to Latino immigrant families in New York. She had volunteered there for years. One of the first things Ms. Sanchez did after receiving the reprieve last November was to apply for her Social Security number and a New York State ID. Several weeks ago, with her new ID in hand, she went on a work trip to Dallas and Chicago, boarding planes for the first time since she arrived in the United States in 1999. For many, government IDs \u2014 particularly driver\u2019s licenses \u2014 have come to symbolize their new status. Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, managing director at United We Dream, the nation\u2019s largest national network of young immigrants, said its members frequently posted photographs of themselves on Facebook, posing with their new licenses. \u201cTo mainstream America, it may not seem like a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to people in our community, it\u2019s a huge deal.\u201d"]
["nyregion", "For many recipients, the lives they lived before receiving the reprieve were not always underground. They attended schools and universities, many held jobs and some have been outspoken activists for immigration reform and other causes. But they did this under severe constraints: though illegal immigrants can legally attend public school and are allowed to attend many colleges and universities, they are barred from many scholarship and tuition-assistance programs and cannot be legally employed. Making ends meet was tough. So, upon receiving the reprieve, recipients have quickly shifted from the shadow economy to legal employment. Erika Flores, 24, who has lived in New York City since she immigrated from Mexico when she was 4, said that until the announcement of the deferred-action policy, she braced for a sudden dead end in her life.

Lloyds \u2014 one of Britain\u2019s four largest lenders \u2014 said on Wednesday that it had returned to private ownership after the British government sold its final stake. The sale is a major milestone for Lloyds and comes five months after the lender made a big bet on the British economy, agreeing to buy Bank of America\u2019s British credit card business for about $2.4 billion. The British government owned 43 percent of Lloyds after it injected 20.3 billion pounds, or $26.2 billion at current exchange rates, into the lender. Including \u00a3400 million in dividends, taxpayers recouped \u00a321.2 billion, the bank said. \u201cThe government has sold its last shares in Lloyds Banking Group, receiving more money than was originally invested,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Lloyds chief executive, said in a news release. \u201cSix years ago, we inherited a business that was in a very fragile financial condition. Thanks to the hard work of everyone at Lloyds, we\u2019ve turned the group around. But the job is not done.\u201d The British government  confirmed on Wednesday that it was no longer a shareholder in the bank. Lloyds shares were up about 2.5 percent in early afternoon trading in London on Wednesday. The bank was forced to take its bailout from the government in 2008 after a poorly timed acquisition of the mortgage lender HBOS, the operator of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, as the financial crisis hit."]
["business/dealbook", "The bank found itself saddled at the time with billions of pounds in bad loans, many from the HBOS acquisition, as the economic environment weakened. When Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio joined Lloyds from Banco Santander in 2011, it had returned to profitability, but was still performing below expectations. Under his leadership, Lloyds has aggressively cut costs, eliminated thousands of jobs, shrunk its ambitions outside Britain and sold off a variety of businesses. Like many of its peers, it has also bolstered its capital to shore up its balance sheet. In 2014, it spun out TSB Banking Group, a move required by European regulators as a condition of the bailout. In 2015, Lloyds began paying a dividend to investors for the first time since the crisis. While the bank\u2019s financial health has improved, Lloyds has still faced several hurdles related to its past conduct. It was one of the biggest providers of so-called payment protection insurance, a contentious product that has cost the banking industry billions of pounds in customer redress. The bank has set aside more than \u00a317 billion to compensate people who were improperly sold the insurance, and it was fined \u00a3117 million in June 2015 for its handling of customer complaints related to the product. Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio has called payment protection insurance the lender\u2019s biggest \u201clegacy issue.\u201d But  a deadline of August 2019 for making new complaints may allow Lloyds and the rest of the British banking industry to finally move past that scandal."]
["business/dealbook", "Lloyds has also faced pressure in recent months over a bribery scandal stemming from a division of HBOS in Reading, England, that focused on helping troubled small businesses. Six people, including two former HBOS employees, have been jailed in the matter. Prosecutors said that bribes, including designer watches, luxury travel and sex parties, were paid in exchange for referrals of troubled HBOS small business clients to a consultancy firm, with many of those companies ultimately going bankrupt. After the sentencing of six people earlier this year, Lloyds said it would conduct an independent review and compensate business owners where appropriate. The bank has set aside \u00a3100 million to cover the compensation. Another question that is lingering for Lloyds is the ultimate impact of Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the European Union. Lloyds officials have said that they do no expect a major impact on the bank\u2019s business, but concerns remain over the potential effects of any economic slowdown after Britain leaves the 28-nation bloc. That said, the British economy has been more resilient since the referendum in June than many had expected. Selling the British government\u2019s stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland has been a priority for Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, as it was for his predecessor, George Osborne. But it has been easier for Lloyds than for R.B.S., in which the government owns a 72 percent stake."]

It\u2019s an intriguing matchup that should include stars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Antoine Griezmann. But most of all, it\u2019s a local derby, and it is happening in the later rounds of the Champions League for the fourth year in a row. Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid will meet in a Champions League semifinal next month after the draw on Friday morning. The winner will claim city bragging rights and a date with the winner of the other semifinal, between France\u2019s A.S. Monaco and the Italian champion Juventus. Real has got the best of Atl\u00e9tico recently in the Champions League, beating it in the 2014 and 2016 finals as well as in the clubs\u2019 quarterfinal meeting in 2015. But Atl\u00e9tico can hold onto its league title in 2014, when it beat out both Real Madrid and Barcelona against all odds. This season, Real is back on top, holding a 3-point lead over Barcelona with a game in hand entering this weekend\u2019s Cl\u00e1sico against Barcelona. Atl\u00e9tico, which has one of the world\u2019s most coveted players in the French striker Griezmann, is out of contention in third place.

Jose Mourinho has recently been in the New World. With homage to Paul Simon, they\u2019ve all gone to look for America. The destination for these journeys is the land of opportunity, the land of milk and honey, the new frontier of soccer bucks. While Americans trek overseas during their summer vacations, many of the world\u2019s most famous soccer personalities reverse that path for summer exhibitions and an increasingly meaningful liaison with M.L.S. Wednesday\u2019s All-Star Game brought Manchester United, the perennial contender, to the noisy little stadium in the Jersey wasteland. A good deal of legitimacy to this summer festival, this continental Woodstock, comes from the continuing validity of M.L.S., now in its 16th season. Fans can make their own judgment about the level of play in M.L.S. Is it a second-tier league or a third, compared with what Americans can see on Univision and Fox and ESPN? That hardly matters. M.L.S. has grown its league prudently, adding teams, expanding into Canada, creating rivalries and presenting teams eager to be bushwhacked by the visitors every July. So what?"]
["sports/soccer", "The fact is that M.L.S. has been a test tube for young American talent and also a haven for aging world talent. It has given soccer fans a place to go, from early spring to midautumn, where they can chant and cheer and see great and goofy things. The league has been a beacon for entrepreneurs like Beckham and gritty old folk heroes like Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco of Mexico, who gave fans in Chicago their money\u2019s worth for a while. Others do not seem to get it. Henry, the French star who played at Arsenal and Barcelona before sampling the discreet charms of postindustrial New Jersey, is leading the league in goals while turning himself into Thierry Ennui. He is asking why all this expectation that he lead and nurture and give interviews? Perhaps because of all the money they pay you, monsieur. The opposite of this is Kasey Keller, who had a great career in England and in Germany and with the United States national team, and is now facing retirement in Seattle. Keller cared enough to be at the All-Star Game that he was willing to fly after Seattle lost, 1-0, on a first-half penalty kick to San Francisco F.C. in a Concacaf Champions League match in Panama City Tuesday. He was expected to be the third, emergency, keeper on Wednesday but entered the game in the 83rd minute as a gesture to his retirement at the end of the season."]

Keller is helping to build something, as did Doug Logan, the first commissioner, and as does Don Garber, who has presided over this steady growth.

This golden young man from Jalisco is a beacon for lead passes with El Tri, as the Mexican national team is known. Manchester United signed him, and he scored 13 goals in 27 Premier League games last season, a stunning debut in a vital position like striker. He plays with an earnest smile and makes public appearances the same way. In a news conference Monday, he was alert and pleasant, and bilingual. Of course, Chicharito\u2019s spectacular growth only infuriates fans in the United States who want to know why their soccer federation has not discovered a dozen Chicharitos within its borders.

["sports/baseball", "Mets Breathe Easier as Niese Gets His First Win Since a D.L. Stint - The New York Times PHILADELPHIA \u2014  A string of indistinct injuries has recently hit the Mets\u2019 pitching staff, giving the team and fans a sense of nervousness every time a pitcher shows the slightest pain. On July 4, Jon Niese was struck in the back by a line drive after throwing only 12 pitches. He was removed from the game and two days later was placed on the disabled list with a left shoulder strain. On Sunday, the Mets unexpectedly announced that Jacob deGrom would visit doctors in New York on Monday after he felt soreness in his shoulder in the days after his last start. Hours after the announcement, closer Jenrry Mejia revealed he had been pitching with a hernia for the past three weeks. So far, none of the injuries appear to have devastated the roster, as the Mets try to protect the valuable arms that will be their nexus for this season and beyond. On Monday, Niese pitched his best game since late June in a 5-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. And though deGrom was placed on the 15-day disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis after a magnetic resonance imaging test, John Ricco, the assistant general manager, said he was optimistic that deGrom would not need more time to recover."]
["sports/baseball", "The stint on the D.L. may actually come at an opportune time for the Mets. As a rookie pitcher on an innings limit, deGrom was due for a break so the team could stretch him out over the remainder of the season.

Since returning from the disabled list on July 21, Niese had been 0-4 with a 5.76 earned run average. He picked up his sixth victory of the season but walked three and hit a batter. Before being placed on the disabled list on July 6, Niese was 5-4 with a 2.96 E.R.A. and had allowed only 28 walks in 17 starts. \u201cBase on balls have hurt him, and they did again today, but I thought he pitched a good game today and got us through seven, which we needed,\u201d Collins said. With the Mets trailing, 2-1, Niese was backed by four runs in the seventh inning, three on a homer by Anthony Recker."]
["sports/baseball", "David Buchanan, 25, who was a nonroster invitee to Phillies spring training, limited the Mets to one run through his first six innings. Originally an unsigned sixth-round pick by the Mets in the 2009 draft, Buchanan was replaced after walking Juan Lagares and allowing a run-scoring double to Matt den Dekker in the seventh. Niese retired the first two batters in the seventh inning before Domonic Brown lined a double to right field. Ben Revere followed with a single to center field, but Lagares cut Brown down at the plate with a precise throw to Recker for the third out and his fourth outfield assist this season. Niese finished the day striking out six batters on 107 pitches, his highest count since May 5. \u201cI was running on fumes there; I was pretty tired,\u201d Niese said. \u201cJuan made that unbelievable play, and I got through it.\u201d Because Mejia pitched in three of the past four games, Jeurys Familia was called upon to collect a four-out save. Chase Utley hit a two-out pinch hit ground-rule double to score Cody Asche, who had walked. Originally, Utley\u2019s hit was ruled a home run, but the play was challenged, and reviews showed a fan reaching over the right-field railing with a hat to impede the ball\u2019s flight. Familia later induced a flyout for his second save in three days. Collins said Mejia would be ready for Tuesday\u2019s game.

["us/politics", "What to Watch For in Washington: Confirmation Hearings and Trump Meeting the Press - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 A blizzard of confirmation hearings. President Obama\u2019s farewell speech. President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s first news conference since July. And, yes, something called a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d in Congress. In the throes of a chaotic political moment by any measure, the coming week stands out as especially \u2014 and, perhaps, strategically \u2014 overstuffed. Here is a taste of what might come, with Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration less than two weeks away: Rarely could anyone in Congress stand accused of moving too quickly. But the slate of confirmation hearings on several of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees will test the reflexes and editorial judgment of even the most experienced C-Span crews. The hearings are scheduled to begin Tuesday, when Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, and Gen. John F. Kelly, the pick for Homeland Security secretary, are set to testify. Also on Tuesday: President Obama\u2019s evening speech, billed as a farewell address from Chicago. It is a final chance to defend his legacy before Mr. Trump takes office. Then it gets complicated. Republicans are expected to hold up to five hearings on Wednesday, including appearances from contentious selections like Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, and Betsy DeVos, his pick for education secretary. Later in the week, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the billionaire investor selected to be commerce secretary, is among those expected to appear before congressional panels."]
["us/politics", "The pace of the hearing schedule and the unorthodox biographies of many in Mr. Trump\u2019s prospective cabinet \u2014 with their far-flung business holdings and nongovernment backgrounds \u2014 have already produced headaches. As of late last week, several appointees had not completed the background checks and ethics disclosure forms typically required before the Senate considers cabinet-level nominees. It is not yet clear if or how these issues might affect the hearing schedule. On Friday, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter M. Shaub Jr., said in a letter that the announced schedule had placed \u201cundue pressure\u201d on the office to rush its reviews of nominees. He added that there was no precedent in the office\u2019s four decades for the Senate holding hearings before such reviews were complete. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, has accused the Trump transition team of colluding with Senate Republicans to \u201cjam through\u201d nominees. Republicans say they simply want to allow the incoming president to install his team as quickly as possible. In an interview on Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, played down the concerns as \u201clittle procedural complaints,\u201d which he attributed to Democrats\u2019 frustration at having lost the election. \u201cWe need to sort of grow up here,\u201d he said. Complaints about the process may not resonate with the broader public, though they will surely continue. In either case, Democrats view the hearings as an opportunity: How will the nominees parry questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s most explosive campaign pledges, like barring Muslim immigrants and promoting torture?"]
["us/politics", "\u201cWhere will they come down?\u201d Mr. Schumer asked in an interview. Democrats have signaled that some nominees \u2014 like Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the choice for health and human services secretary and a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 will face more hostile questioning than others. But after a stunning election victory that saw Mr. Trump seize the mantle of populism, becoming a hero to working-class white voters and promising to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d the Democrats hope to establish a different theme: Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees would become by far the wealthiest cabinet in modern history. Some, like Ms. DeVos and Andrew F. Puzder, the pick for labor secretary, are notable Republican donors, far removed from the lives of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters. Mr. Trump is, as a general rule, disinclined to cede the spotlight. On Wednesday, as his nominees labor through confirmation hearings, the president-elect is expected to hold his first formal news conference since July, in New York. (A note of caution: Mr. Trump has a record of scheduling and then postponing promised events.) To critics, the timing is unsubtle. Mr. Trump, they say, is hoping to deflect attention from any unsavory revelations that might emerge from the hearings. Even his admirers concede that Mr. Trump, a consummate showman, has a gift for tactical distraction. Still, reporters will welcome the chance to question Mr. Trump on no shortage of topics \u2014 from his skeptical response to the intelligence community\u2019s consensus on Russian interference in the presidential election to persistent concerns about his business entanglements and conflicts of interest."]
["us/politics", "Twenty-four-hour news networks rarely have 24 hours\u2019 worth of news to cover. Wednesday might be the exception. Though no date has been set, the Senate is planning to gather midweek \u2014 with Wednesday as the likeliest day \u2014 for a marathon session known as a vote-a-rama, which comes as Republicans are charging ahead with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is moving toward passing a budget resolution that would help clear the way for the law to be gutted. The approval of the budget measure is not, as its name might imply, about passing a budget. Rather, it is one of a series of steps that Republicans plan to take to unravel the health care law in a way that will not expose them to the prospect of a Democratic filibuster. In the interim, Republicans will have to endure the vote-a-rama, where dozens of amendments can be considered in rapid succession. The downside for Republicans is that Democrats can propose amendments that might force them into politically uncomfortable votes. And after already slogging through a day of nomination hearings, the senators will take little comfort in this scheduling reality: If the vote-a-rama begins on a Wednesday, it might well end in the wee hours of Thursday."]

["magazine", "Maajid Nawaz\u2019s Radical Ambition - The New York Times I met Maajid Nawaz on a drizzly afternoon in March, tucked in a corner of the restaurant at the central London members\u2019 club he uses as a satellite office. He was dabbing the chicken from his Caesar salad into a mound of yellow English mustard, which he stopped doing for long enough to load a video on his iPhone and slide it across the table. It showed the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Heidi Beirich, speaking at Duke University about him. \u201cLet me just give you an example of Maajid Nawaz \u2014 our problem with him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe believes that all mosques should be surveilled. In other words, his opinion is that all Muslims are potential terrorists.\u201d Nawaz, a Muslim himself, bristled with frustration at the claim. In fact, he explained, he is on record making the case against collective surveillance. A former Islamist, for the past nine years Nawaz has made a name for himself as an indefatigable anti-extremist activist. These days he blends seamlessly into the sort of cosmopolitan circles that extremists decry; at his club, dressed in an olive bomber jacket over fitted workout sweats, he could have been a senior marketing exec or a music-video director. At 39, Nawaz is handsome and vaguely famous looking in person, prematurely silver-haired, with a widow\u2019s peak and Mephistophelean soul patch that punctuates a politician\u2019s easy smile. Whenever I saw him, he dapped me with one of those handclasp-half-hugs that, to anyone of a certain age, serves as shorthand for an adolescence steeped in the manners of hip-hop."]
["magazine", "For Nawaz\u2019s detractors, of whom there are many, it\u2019s this very chameleon quality, this at-homeness in disparate roles and spaces, that has earned him a reputation as something of a charlatan, a preening opportunist cashing in on his own sensational travails by means of society\u2019s abundant anti-Muslim bias. This uncharitable narrative has shadowed him from the outset, yet his point of view has only grown more relevant after an exceptionally violent 2016 that saw coordinated suicide bombings in Brussels and Istanbul; a mass shooting in a nightclub in Orlando; the ambush and execution of a police officer and his partner near Paris; a Bastille Day slaughter in Nice; ax and suicide bomb attacks in Bavaria; the throat slitting of a Catholic priest in a church in Normandy; pressure-cooker bombs in Manhattan and New Jersey; and a massacre at a Christmas market in Berlin. And on March 22 this year in London, a man mowed down pedestrians with his car near Parliament before stabbing a police constable to death."]
["magazine", "With each grisly new assault \u2014 and the specter of Syria and the Islamic State looming beyond it \u2014 the voices of hatred and reaction in the United States and throughout Britain and Europe found not only sympathetic ears but also willing hands to pull levers in the voting booths. Throughout the upheaval and backlash, Nawaz has remained a constant presence in the media: on \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d trying to draw a distinction between religion and political dogma; in his book, \u201cIslam and the Future of Tolerance\u201d (co-written with the prominent \u201cnew atheist\u201d Sam Harris), insisting that Islamism does have something to do with Islam and that ISIS in fact possesses a plausible if terribly ungenerous interpretation of the Quran. But whatever role Nawaz enjoys as a public intellectual is inextricable from his personal celebrity as a former fundamentalist. His work is his story, and his story is his celebrity. In order to make his case against radicalism, he finds himself in the not entirely enviable position of nonstop self-promotion. On this front, he\u2019s as busy as ever. He is finishing a documentary based on his book with Harris, but foremost on Nawaz\u2019s mind these days is the 2017 opening of the first new chapter of his anti-extremist organization, the Quilliam Foundation, in the United States. \u201cLots of Muslims in America are basically liberals, but if you don\u2019t have a visibly anti-extremist presence, then the Trumps of this world win\u201d through fear-mongering and misrepresentation, he says. \u201cOur presence is needed in America to reassure the mainstream, whereas our presence is needed in Europe to stop radicalization.\u201d"]
["magazine", "Despite such deliberate affirmations and qualifications, there is nonetheless confusion as to where Nawaz\u2019s sympathies actually lie. According to Vice News, he has earned a \u201cterrorism\u201d designation on Thomson Reuters World-Check, a risk-assessment database. (Thomson Reuters would not confirm this.) But, last October, the Southern Poverty Law Center took the incredible step of including him on a \u201cField Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists,\u201d which they published with three other research organizations. The guide listed 15 public figures, and Nawaz was the only Muslim among them. (This is why Beirich brought him up at Duke.) He was visibly furious whenever the topic came up and told me he plans to crowdfund a legal response. Though he and his allies, and even some of his opponents, have complained to the S.P.L.C. \u2014 there is a change.org petition to remove him and the Somali-born atheist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which has garnered almost 12,000 signatures \u2014 the group has not wavered on its position, the costs of which have already been real for Quilliam. Nawaz claims that the listing has compromised some funding for the organization. \u201cI consider myself a liberal and wanted to work with liberals,\u201d he said, shaking his head. In reality, his views on Islamic extremism are more complex than these labels allow, which is, arguably, one of the more compelling reasons to listen to him on the subject."]
["magazine", "Early in Nawaz\u2019s 2012 memoir, \u201cRadical: My Journey Out of Islamist Extremism,\u201d there\u2019s an eyebrow-raising scene. The narrator, an irreligious, N.W.A.-loving child, has resorted to strapping a knife under his shirt for fear of the gangs of skinheads that stalk his Essex suburb, Southend. He is 15, and on this afternoon, he is with his older brother, Kaashif (identified by a pseudonym in the book), and a friend who has converted to Islam. Neighborhood racists have chased the boys with baseball bats and now have them cornered and outnumbered. The skinheads\u2019 leader steps forward and asks to talk. Kaashif gestures to the side of the road, where he and the skinhead fall into a tense and private discussion. When the two return, the skinheads begin to retreat. Incredulous, Maajid demands to know what his brother has told them. Kaashif says he told the skinhead, \u201cWe\u2019re Muslims, and we don\u2019t fear death\u201d \u2014 and, furthermore, that he was carrying a bomb in his backpack. The anecdote, which surfaces repeatedly in \u201cRadical\u201d and ultimately swells to the dimensions of a creation myth, is quintessential Nawaz. On one hand, it\u2019s a distillation of his larger rhetorical project, capturing the confused and painful textures of contemporary Muslim experience that can lead to the embrace of Islamism: an initial lack of familiarity with religion; local grievance spun into a narrative of global victimization; a tribal relation to other Muslims beyond racial and ethnic categorization; the illusion of empowerment through threat of violence. On the other hand, it has become emblematic of the cantankerous, highly personal discourse that clings to the man himself: For a number of reasons \u2014 more on which later \u2014 many of his critics have come to claim that the anecdote is pure fabrication."]
["magazine", "What\u2019s indisputable is that soon after that day in Southend, first following Kaashif\u2019s example but then with a fervency that was entirely his own, Nawaz threw himself into his new identity, falling under the sway of Nasim Ghani, a charismatic young recruiter and future leader of the British branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a multinational Islamic revolutionary organization founded in 1953 in Jerusalem. H.T., as Nawaz refers to it, advocates the imposition of Shariah law through \u201cbloodless\u201d coups in majority-Muslim countries first and ultimately in the West as well. In other words, these were Islamists but not jihadists, and the distinction isn\u2019t frivolous. Still, the line is a porous one: Two H.T. leaders, Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri Mohammad, would go on to lead a splinter group of a far more deadly variety. In September 2001, after stints of organizing and recruiting for H.T. in London and Pakistan, Nawaz took his first wife and their infant son to Alexandria, Egypt, where he posed as an Arabic-language student while secretly proselytizing for the group. Though H.T. is legal in Britain, it is banned in many majority-Muslim countries, including Egypt. In 2002, at 24, Nawaz was forcibly removed from his home, blindfolded and thrown in the back of a van, one more Islamist caught up in the wide and extralegal international crackdown on extremism in the wake of 9/11. He spent his next four years in Egyptian prisons, where he claims to have witnessed torture and where, in his solitude, he was able to memorize half of the Quran."]
["magazine", "A pivotal moment in Nawaz\u2019s moral education came when news of the 7/7 attacks in London reached the inmates at Tora, Egypt\u2019s prison notorious for holding political dissidents. Four attackers bombed a bus and three subway trains, claiming 52 lives. Nawaz writes that he suddenly \u201cfelt revulsion\u201d at the human cost of his ideas. A man Nawaz calls Omar, a Dagestani bomb maker, had celebrated the slaughter. Nawaz is a hero in his own telling of the ensuing exchange: He claims to have debated Omar for the entirety of the day about the legitimacy of killing British civilians, until the latter eventually conceded defeat. Nawaz writes, \u201cI felt that I had saved many future lives.\u201d In 2004, Amnesty International adopted Nawaz as a prisoner of conscience and secured his return to London two years later. His was not an overnight epiphany, but within two more years, he had graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, renounced Islamism and H.T. and publicly reinvented himself as an advocate for liberal democracy: a media-savvy expert on preventing radicalization. His enemies, a long list made up of family members, ex-friends and former H.T. associates, have publicly questioned his conversion narrative. Ian Nisbet, a white convert to Islam who was jailed with Nawaz in Egypt, told a reporter from Alternet that Nawaz remained a fanatical Islamist after he was freed. Indeed, back in England, Nawaz appeared on the BBC\u2019s \u201cHardtalk\u201d program and declared that his experience in Egypt left him convinced \u201cthat there is a need to establish this caliphate as soon as possible.\u201d In his defense, Nawaz claims that making a clean break with a former life is both difficult and genuinely confusing. He rather colorfully compares it to a breakup with a lover. (Nawaz and his first wife split up around the time of his departure from H.T.) He has also insisted that his public positions were in part strategic: He didn\u2019t want to tip his hand to H.T. until he had his exit plans in place."]
["magazine", "Whatever the case, that same year, alongside a college friend named Ed Husain, who had already made a name for himself with his own reverse-conversion memoir, \u201cThe Islamist,\u201d Nawaz co-founded the Quilliam Foundation, which they named for William Quilliam, a British convert who opened one of Britain\u2019s first mosques in the late 1880s. Quilliam\u2019s first headquarters occupied the ground floor of a brick-and-terra-cotta rowhouse overlooking the verdure of Russell Square, practically the same view T.S. Eliot would have had when he worked at Faber & Faber, and just a block from two of the sites of the 7/7 attacks. As his critics constantly stress, Nawaz\u2019s timing was convenient; the British government was then looking to finance anti-extremist organizations and provided Quilliam with early funding. Nawaz, then, is somewhat like British Petroleum when it is tasked with cleaning up a catastrophic oil spill: His main qualification to do this kind of decontamination work is precisely his experience as a contaminator. As recently as the mid-1990s, Islamist ideology was unpopular in British Muslim communities. \u201cWe would have to convince people of something that is strange to them,\u201d he told me of those days. \u201cWe had to really hone our argumentative skills and our ability to convince and influence people as that vanguard of the Islamist movement in the West.\u201d He insists his background as an Islamist is what allows him and others at Quilliam today not only to pinpoint Islamism\u2019s weaknesses but also to employ the very same tenacious ability to communicate ideas and influence people for the purpose now of advocating liberal values. \u201cThey\u2019re transferable skills\u201d is how he once put it to me. What Nawaz seems to understand better than any of the other critics of Islam he\u2019s so often lumped with is that Islamism is cool \u2014 and it is cool in some of the same ways that punk rock and gangsta rap and macho rebellion in general, whether symbolic or real, are perennially seductive. As a result, countering it will have to mean finding ways to, as he puts it, \u201cmake it cool to be a liberal Muslim.\u201d"]
["magazine", "And that may be harder than it seems. While the vast majority of British Muslims today are certainly not flocking to join groups like H.T. \u2014 and many who have never been attracted to the ideology justifiably find it irritating to be lectured by a man who was \u2014 a sobering number nonetheless have expressed views that would be very much at home in even more extreme precincts. An online poll done in Britain following the 7/7 bombings, for example, showed that more than a fifth of British Muslims felt some sympathy for the bombers\u2019 feelings and motives; more than half said they could understand the bombers\u2019 behavior; and nearly a third agreed that \u201cWestern society is decadent and immoral and that Muslims should seek to bring it to an end\u201d by nonviolent means. One incredible Gallup report from 2009 found that 0 percent of British Muslims viewed homosexual acts as morally acceptable. Though it is not at all clear what pushes any given individual to cross the line into violence, attitudes like these are what Nawaz and Quilliam have controversially described as the \u201cmood music\u201d to terrorist acts. It is this last contention that seems to be the crux of the S.P.L.C. complaint against Nawaz, along with the disclosure that, in 2010, Quilliam provided a list of nonviolent \u201cIslamist\u201d organizations to a British counterterrorism official. But Nawaz justifies the move by arguing that the distinction between violent and nonviolent Islamism is far less rigid than many liberals would like to think. \u201cNow when these guys are joining ISIS, the arguments have been made,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is just putting that last piece in the jigsaw: \u2018I\u2019m going to go and fight for this cause.\u2019 But the ideology\u2019s already been established. The surveys and the polls tell you that.\u201d"]
["magazine", "Before Quilliam moved late last year to an undisclosed location for security reasons, I visited Nawaz on several occasions. The organization hummed with the energy and sense of mission of a tech start-up. On one side were doors leading into a large and crowded room where 20-odd analysts, academics and imams were doing the intellectual grunt work that the foundation demands. On the other was the modest office Nawaz used for himself. Though he is the face of the organization, he is hardly the only employee with an exotic r\u00e9sum\u00e9. On my first visit, my eyes fixed on a small prayer rug draped neatly over the arm of a desk chair. \u201cOh, that\u2019s for him!\u201d Nawaz quickly clarified, referring to his officemate, Noman Benotman, the current president of the organization and a former jihadist who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan, tried to violently depose Muammar Gaddafi in the 1990s and later worked with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri in Sudan. Back across the hall there was also Dr. Usama Hasan, the head of Islamic studies at the organization. The son of a conservative and influential Salafi sheikh, Hasan used a break from his studies at Cambridge to engage in jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan (on a scale of one-to-ISIS, he told me, \u201cour group maybe got up to about five\u201d). And yet, in 2011, after waging holy war in the east and after 25 years of service at his father\u2019s London mosque, that kind of effort didn\u2019t count for very much when he came under attack by hard-liners. He was forced to stop delivering Friday prayers when 50 Muslim protesters stormed his lecture and openly called for his execution. His offense had been to venture that Islam could be compatible with modern theories of evolution and that Muslim women should be allowed to uncover their hair in public."]
["magazine", "Aside from the life experience of some of its members and the issuance of the occasional counter-fatwa, Quilliam is a standard left-of-center think tank: a body of experts conducting research and providing advice and ideas on specific political or social problems in support of liberal democracy. The group works to shape public opinion from the top down, making frequent media appearances, publishing reports that aim for the highest levels of government (such as a critical 2009 investigation into the ways British prisons incubate extremism) and periodically advising government ministers and heads of state on matters of terrorism. But they also engage ordinary Muslims and non-Muslims alike through outreach work, organizing debate and training programs in Europe and the Middle East. All of this ought to make Quilliam a natural ally of progressives and of institutions like the Southern Poverty Law Center, whose mission, after all, is to advocate for the vulnerable. Yet that has not been the case. Nawaz\u2019s layered arguments and concessions \u2014 his insistence, for example, that Islam does have something to do with Islamism \u2014 provoke a visceral suspicion among those who are concerned with fighting Islamophobia above all. A term that you will hear with frequency from Nawaz is \u201cthe regressive left,\u201d as in purportedly progressive institutions like the S.P.L.C. that, often starting from a legitimate concern that Muslims en masse not be persecuted for the actions of a few, nonetheless embody a perplexingly backward mind-set when it comes to Islam. \u201cIt\u2019s an Orientalist fetish,\u201d Nawaz says, \u201ca deeply socially conservative Muslim who is medieval in their outlook is a \u2018real\u2019 Muslim, and anyone who\u2019s challenging that status quo is a sellout.\u201d The left has, in Nawaz\u2019s view, forfeited what\u2019s best about the liberal project, entirely conceding the right to speak in moral absolutes and about universal values. \u201cThe problem is you can\u2019t draw a line with that reasoning: Why is what ISIS is doing bad, then?\u201d"]
["magazine", "A core idea Quilliam espouses is that space must be claimed for secular identities within Islam; the measure of Muslim authenticity would then be a matter of individual imagination and will, not a test to pass or fail. In other words, he would like to see many more Muslims thinking, speaking and acting like him. Which is a big part of the reason it\u2019s impossible to think of Quilliam independent of the outsize figure cut by its co-founder, and why so much debate about the validity of the organization\u2019s ideas comes down to a question of being for or against Nawaz. Attack pieces about Nawaz have practically become their own literary genre. In the summer of 2015, The Guardian ran a deeply critical story about him, which questioned the integrity of Nawaz\u2019s work with the Cameron administration and took him to task for, among other misdeeds, \u201csipping a skinny flat white\u201d coffee in front of the reporter. This was followed, in January 2016, by a hard takedown at The New Republic, whose writer, Nathan Lean, had earlier referred on Twitter to Nawaz as Sam Harris\u2019s \u201clap dog.\u201d Roughly a week after that piece came a longer, even more personal attack at Alternet, which stood out in its attempt to debunk, scene by scene, the events in \u201cRadical.\u201d The authors revisited the subject of the bomb in the backpack and quoted Nawaz\u2019s older brother as well as an anonymous cousin, who called the story \u201cimaginary.\u201d (Many of the sources in the Alternet article seem concerned that Kaashif\u2019s ruse in the anecdote might be taken literally.) When I asked him about it, Nawaz was dismissive. \u201cYou go to a deeply wounded brother that loved me all of his life, and I turn out to be not who he aspires for me to be,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a journalist, you can exploit that.\u201d He shrugged soberly."]
["magazine", "It is undeniable that one advantage, and shortcoming, of memoir as a form lies in its ability to dominate the reader through an empirical imbalance that can never be resolved in its entirety. Arguments, when unsound, can be negated, but who can negate another person\u2019s lived experience? It is a rhetorical tactic that is, in fact, most at home on the left, where personal stories of grievance and oppression are typically set in opposition to the status quo in the wider society. Perhaps, then, this is why so much attention has been paid to Nawaz\u2019s biography. If his life story can be shown to be contrived, the deeper message, however compelling, can be pre-emptively dismissed: Not only is the messenger\u2019s life not a genuine Muslim life, when seen from this angle, it may even prove to be an anti-Muslim life. I saw Nawaz in New York in September, while he was in town fund-raising for Quilliam\u2019s American chapter. We had made plans to meet at a Soho hotel for a drink, but he was running late. When I asked after him, the concierge either didn\u2019t know his real name or pretended not to. Nawaz and Benotman have been targeted by Al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates, and he travels under an alias. When he finally arrived, we went down to the bar, and he was in wonderful spirits. He\u2019s been criticized in the British press for drinking and receiving a lap dance at a strip club, but in situations like this, it\u2019s strange to think of Nawaz as having been anything like a humorless extremist. Yet the bind he has made for himself is a real one: He has to prove that liberal, moderate Islam can be \u201ccool,\u201d while not coming off as too hip to convince the left of his Muslim authenticity. He runs the very real risk of satisfying no one."]

In addition to the regular Quilliam bodyguards, there were plainclothes counterterrorism officers monitoring the site. Inside the venue, a shirtless, tattooed Kuwaiti performance artist did preparatory stretches with his assistant and a crystal ball. He would eventually be tied up in a corset and left on the floor for guests to contemplate. The crowd sipped wine and soft drinks and milled about the sparsely hung, mildly provocative artwork, which was in fact beside the point. The point, of course, was that they were even daring to do this in the first place."]
["magazine", "I fell into conversation with Nawaz\u2019s mother and little sister and lost track of time as the space filled up all around us. There were whites, blacks, Persians, Arabs; people looked devout and nondevout, gay, straight, young and old. Standing next to me was a man with the voluminous beard of a cleric, turned out in an ankle-length djellaba, ironed as crisply as a bedsheet at the Ritz, a pair of Nike Air Force 1s and a flat-brimmed New Era cap printed with a four-letter expletive. He looked like a cross between the leader of Hezbollah and the Bay Area rapper Lil B. The room darkened and quieted, and Nawaz, brimming with life, stepped into the middle of the crowd, whose diversity he lauded, and thanked them all for coming. Like the B-boy he once aspired to be, he thrills to the sound of his own voice flowing through the microphone. \u201cThe first thing they do is try to silence us, and the first to suffer are the creators!\u201d he told the room to enthusiastic applause. \u201cBut while you throw gays off the rooftops, we who are Muslims want to respond like this!\u201d As I watched Nawaz bask in the applause of his most earnest admirers and glanced back at the walls adorned with such unbearably unhip art, the enormity of his task pressed itself upon me. After all, Islamism, like good art, is innately subversive; it captures diffuse feelings of alienation in a way that is difficult to fabricate. And therein lies the biggest challenge confronting Quilliam in Europe and, as it seeks to expand, in America: Though Nawaz himself is a star, there is something both noble and perilously square about this kind of eat-your-peas forced secularism."]

Without having planned to, I found myself at the hotel bar in New York opening up to Nawaz about a recent train ride my wife and I made in France. I watched an agitated young Arab man and his wife, in full abaya, shut themselves inside the bathroom along with all of their luggage. When they opened the door, the hair on my neck stood up, and I braced myself for a fusillade that never came. Even as I chastised myself for overreacting, I was convinced that the man continued to behave strangely. My shame increased with each moment nothing happened. Nawaz listened intently to my story, but his eyes showed he\u2019d long since arrived at his answer. \u201cYou\u2019re caught in a classically Catch-22 situation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two competing forces, which are entirely legitimate. One is not wanting to racially profile, and the other is not wanting to be the neighbor of the San Bernardino shooter who didn\u2019t want to profile and, as a result, people lose their lives.

Opponents in the United States \u2014 President Trump chief among them \u2014 argue that it has allowed Mexico to benefit at the expense of its neighbor to the north. As proof, the Trump administration has pointed to the trade deficit, with Americans buying more goods and services from Mexico and Canada than vice versa. Many economists argue, however, that these bilateral trade deficits, when viewed in isolation, are not a good measure of a nation\u2019s economic health. The administration has also blamed Nafta for job losses in the United States, a persistent theme during Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign.

The Trump administration wants to increase that figure, a move that is supported by the biggest automobile union in the United States. Carmakers, however, are wary, saying that such a move could raise their costs. \u2022 Arbitration Under Nafta, companies in North America can use a system of independent arbitration to force a country to do away with measures that violate the trade deal. The system has been used mostly by Canadian and Mexican companies against the United States, and the White House wants to overhaul it. \u2022 Modernization One area in which the countries seem to agree is the need to modernize Nafta, which predates the ubiquitousness of the internet. While the sides\u2019 positions differ, updates could address e-commerce and newer workplace and environmental rules. The first round of negotiations was not congenial.

By the time the children arrive at camp around 8 a.m., she has been up for three or four hours. And her day is just getting started.

Cuba was also without six other players and Coach Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez Triana, who did not arrive because of what an official called \u201clogistical problems.\u201d Mexico\u2019s 6-0 victory, which could have been even more decisive, was a cause for celebration. The crowd, announced at 54,126, groaned after the near misses, such as when Carlos Vela twice rattled the goal posts, and cheered each goal as if it were a World Cup winner, waving flags and tossing cups of beer in the air. The final minutes elapsed with toilet paper rolls and smoke bombs raining onto the field. The tournament is critical for Mexico, which saved its best players for the Gold Cup rather than the more prestigious Copa Am\u00e9rica, which concluded with Chile\u2019s win on July 4. Though Mexico\u2019s roster features international stars, such as Vela, who has returned to the national team after a three-year hiatus, and the 2012 Olympics hero Oribe Peralta, who had a hat trick against Cuba, it will have to do without two of its best: forward Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and defender H\u00e9ctor Moreno, who were injured before the tournament."]

It didn\u2019t come wrapped in shiny paper, or decorated with a bow. But a note said it was from Bob Stapleton, the new chairman of U.S.A. Cycling, and now every single clean American cyclist has reason to celebrate. That gift was the news that Steve Johnson, the president and chief executive of U.S.A. Cycling, will leave his job after the world road cycling championships next fall, concluding nearly a decade as the leader of cycling in the United States. It means that, finally, the man who has been entrenched in the top level of the sport since joining U.S.A. Cycling in 1999 will hop on his bike and ride off into the sunset. I say finally \u2014 and hooray \u2014 because it is high time for Johnson to exit the national federation, stage left. Really, he missed his cue a few years ago. A big hook should have dragged him out of his corner office in 2012, when Lance Armstrong was found to be the kingpin of systematic doping on his United States Postal Service teams, and when nearly every top American rider of the past generation admitted to doping to help Armstrong win. Armstrong and those riders \u2014 men like George Hincapie, Christian Vande Velde and David Zabriskie \u2014 all rose through the ranks while Johnson was at U.S.A. Cycling."]
["sports/cycling", "Instead, Johnson, who told me Tuesday that he was retiring at 64 because he was \u201cold and crotchety,\u201d remained in charge. Which was kind of like a principal keeping his job when his top students cheated on tests for more than a decade, and everybody else \u2014 teachers, other students, parents \u2014 knew about it and walked the hallways passing one another answer keys in broad daylight. Maybe that principal didn\u2019t know about the cheating. But if he was any good at his profession, he should have known. Sure, U.S.A. Cycling is much stronger financially than when Johnson took over, and Johnson boasted to me about that. But sports should be about more than just the bottom line. Integrity has to be equally important, if the clean athletes are to believe they are getting a fair shot at winning. Leaders like Johnson are all too common in Olympic sports. Look at Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, soccer\u2019s worldwide governing body. He has been president for 16 years now, and even his first election was clouded by accusations of bribery. His tenure has been marred by embezzlement, match fixing and (more) bribery. Under his watch, nearly half of FIFA\u2019s executive committee members have been tarnished by ethics violations. So what did Blatter get for being in charge during that dark time? The possibility of a fifth term!"]

It\u2019s good that Johnson is on his way out, but bad that he is staying for nearly another year, to aid in the transition to a new president, considering his inaction during the past several years regarding doping in the sport. In 2010, he was among those who had received emails from Floyd Landis that detailed the doping on the Postal Service team. But instead of speaking out loudly about clean sport, Johnson spoke only in whispers, if at all. \u201cI am surprised at all of this,\u201d he told me when I got him on the phone in late 2010 and asked him about the possibility that Armstrong and so many other American riders might have doped. If Johnson truly had been an opponent of doping, he would have protected the riders who were testifying against Armstrong in his doping case. Yet two people with ties to U.S.A. Cycling, who weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the issue, say the names of witnesses were leaked to the news media out of the federation\u2019s headquarters. The worst part of Johnson\u2019s tenure might be that, according to Zabriskie, he knew about doping on the team long before the Armstrong scandal broke."]
["sports/cycling", "Zabriskie told me two years ago that he had admitted to Johnson in 2004, then again in 2006, that he had been given performance-enhancing drugs while riding on the Postal Service team. And he said that Johnson, who had befriended him when Zabriskie was just a teenager, never did a thing about it. Johnson said Tuesday that Zabriskie never told him that he had doped. Zabriskie\u2019s accusations didn\u2019t sit well with Stapleton, who became chairman of U.S.A. Cycling last summer and has been a longtime proponent of eradicating doping from the sport. He investigated the claims against Johnson but couldn\u2019t find any hard evidence to use against him, said the two people with ties to U.S.A. Cycling. Stapleton, the former owner of the HTC-Highroad team, declined on Tuesday to discuss with me the details of Johnson\u2019s parting, choosing instead to focus on where U.S.A. Cycling can go, not where it has been. He said the search for a new president and C.E.O. was underway. Because U.S.A. Cycling has been painfully silent on important issues for so long, it was easy to like what he had to say. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to fundamentals, back to the sport as a healthy lifestyle and the highest ideals of sport, like hard work, discipline and fair play \u2014 those American ideals and sense of values about sport,\u201d Stapleton said. \u201cI want our athletes, our fans, everybody, to believe in what we\u2019re doing and believe that we\u2019re a standup organization and believe that we\u2019re going to do things the right way.\u201d"]

Mr. Kurniawan sold fraudulent wines mixed in his home kitchen complete with fake labels to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people and leading wine enthusiasts. Mr. Kurniawan was able to make them believe that his bottles were both real and rare because of his reputation for an encyclopedic cellar and a finely tuned palate. \u201cRudy Kurniawan planned and executed an intricate counterfeit wine scheme,\u201d said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. \u201cNow, Kurniawan will trade his life of luxury for time behind bars.\u201d In addition to prison time, Mr. Kurniawan was ordered to forfeit $20 million and to pay more than $28 million in restitution to his victims.

["business", "Another Airbag Maker Is Under Scrutiny After Fatal Rupture - The New York Times Airbags made by a Tennessee supplier came under heightened scrutiny on Thursday after a rupture in one of its bags was linked to the death of a driver in Canada last month. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the American regulator, said it had opened a formal investigation of bags made by the company, ARC Automotive. The fatal rupture raised the prospect of adding millions of cars to an already extensive recall of exploding airbags made by another manufacturer, Takata. American regulators are investigating hybrid airbag inflaters made by ARC that use both a gas and an explosive compound called ammonium nitrate. The agency had opened a preliminary inquiry into at least eight million airbag inflaters made by ARC for use in Chrysler, General Motors, Kia and Hyundai cars through 2004, but the formal investigation will go beyond that population of inflaters. The agency was still determining the number of airbags affected, it said. Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the agency, said the ARC airbag inflaters had not been recalled, but said a safety recall was \u201cone possible outcome\u201d of the investigation. Takata\u2019s airbags have been linked to at least 14 deaths and more than 100 injuries, mostly in the United States. Fourteen automakers have recalled some 64 million Takata airbag inflaters in the United States, and millions more worldwide."]
["business", "The death in Canada was the first known fatality linked to a rupture in an airbag from a supplier other than Takata. But the safety agency said on Thursday that the ARC and Takata airbag inflaters had \u201csignificant design differences\u201d and that the fatal ARC rupture probably had a different cause. According to the Canadian auto safety regulator, Transport Canada, the driver of a 2009 Hyundai Elantra died when the driver\u2019s side airbag inflater exploded after a low-speed collision in Newfoundland on July 8. \u201cThe incident was a low-speed collision, which was expected to be survivable,\u201d Daniel Savoie, a spokesman for Transport Canada, wrote in an email. The cases in the United States that prompted a preliminary investigation last year involved ARC airbags in a Town and Country minivan in 2009 and in a Kia Optima sedan in 2014. In the 2009 incident, Lois Dutton of Ashtabula County, Ohio, was severely injured when her airbag ruptured in a collision with a snowmobile. Ms. Dutton said in a 2014 interview that she \u201csaw a cloud of white smoke and a flash of white\u201d as the airbag ruptured upon impact. ARC uses a small amount of ammonium nitrate encased in the airbag inflater. Takata, which also uses ammonium nitrate in its inflaters, has acknowledged that the compound can break down over time, especially when exposed to high humidity. But ARC also uses an inert gas mixture that is stored in the airbag\u2019s inflater at high pressure, the safety agency said. It said humidity was probably not a factor in ARC\u2019s case."]

Headed by Philip K.

Chief, Visiting Somalia, Pleads for Aid to Avert Famine - The New York Times MOGADISHU, Somalia \u2014 The secretary general of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, arrived in Somalia on Tuesday and appealed for $825 million in aid to address drought and cholera in the East Africa nation on the brink of famine. Mr. Guterres said the money was needed to help 5.5 million people, about half of Somalia\u2019s population, survive the next six months. A former prime minister of Portugal who was picked in October to lead the United Nations, Mr. Guterres announced his visit on Twitter. Last week, he declared that famine was underway in part of South Sudan, and warned that people in areas of Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen were also at risk of dying from hunger. At the airport in Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital, Mr. Guterres met with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a former prime minister who was elected last month. Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire said that droughts and cholera had killed more than 200 people in southern and central Somalia. The country has already had two consecutive years of drought, and meteorologists expect crops to fail again this year. Famine was last declared in Somalia in July 2011, after an estimated 260,000 people died, most during a two-month period. In a joint news conference, Mr. Mohamed and Mr. Guterres pleaded for assistance. \u201cThe reason Secretary General Guterres came here today is to show support and solidarity with the Somali people at this time of humanitarian crisis,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said."]

The United Nations leader also visited the town of Baidoa, where a deadly cholera strain has struck. Ahmed Abdi Hassan, the Somali consul general in Aden, Yemen, who was part of a delegation that welcomed Mr. Guterres, called the visit historic, likening it to one last year by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who opened an embassy in Mogadishu and called for deeper ties between the nations.

During the final few months of last year, neither disappointed. Both companies singled out the booming sales of their devices in the quarterly financial results that they reported on Thursday. Apple boasted of its highest revenue ever for a new lineup of iPhones, which included the high-priced iPhone X. Amazon raved about the demand for gadgets like the Echo, which runs its intelligent voice assistant, Alexa. \u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said. \"We don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201d Amazon, a company once known for routinely posting losses, more than doubled its profit thanks to strong growth in its cloud computing division and a newer business for the company \u2014 advertising. It also benefited from a large gain resulting from changes to the United States tax code. For the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, net income rose to $1.86 billion, the highest profit in its history and more than double the $749 million from a year earlier. A big part of the increase, $789 million, came from the tax benefit. Revenue jumped 38 percent to $60.45 billion from a year earlier."]

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report. While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter. Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier. By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion. Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices. Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware."]
["technology", "For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter. While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000. \u201cCustomer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X,\u201d Timothy D.

Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones. The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones. Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion.

Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps. Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units. Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts. But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season. Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.

Potter, 43, and the other man, Graham Hunt, 29, leapt near dusk off Taft Point, a promontory about 3,000 feet above the floor of Yosemite Valley, not far from the iconic granite masses of El Capitan and Half Dome. Flying in wingsuits, they tried to clear a notch in the granite cliffs but instead smashed into the rocks in quick succession. Neither of the men pulled a parachute.

But Potter fought and flouted the rules for many years.

Why not chase after it? Maybe it brings you to some other tangent. Chasing after the unattainable is the fun part.\u201d Potter, who grew up mostly in New Hampshire, bloomed on the Yosemite climbing scene nearly 20 years ago. In 2001, he climbed the nose route of El Capitan in a record 3 hours 24 minutes. He was the first to free-climb (no ropes except to catch falls) both El Capitan and Half Dome in 24 hours.

["business/dealbook", "With Phil Mickelson on Witness List, Gambler\u2019s Insider Trading Trial Begins - The New York Times A high-rolling Las Vegas sports gambler, William T. Walters, is on trial in Lower Manhattan on insider trading charges. But for many in the sports world, a more pressing question is whether the golfer Phil Mickelson will testify. Mr. Mickelson, known as Lefty because of his left-handed stroke, is one of the people who federal authorities say were on the receiving end of a stock tip that prosecutors contend Mr. Walters got illegally from a director at Dean Foods. Mr. Mickelson is not charged with any wrongdoing, but he was named as a relief defendant in a suit filed by securities regulators. He agreed to turn over the $1 million in profits he made on the trade. Mr. Mickelson\u2019s name came up on Wednesday in the opening statement by federal prosecutors and was listed in a questionnaire given to prospective jurors in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. On Monday, the judge presiding over the case, P. Kevin Castel, dismissed one person from the jury pool who he said had a \u201clook of rapture\u201d at the mention of Mr. Mickelson during the jury selection process. As for Mr. Walters, federal prosecutors contend he realized profits and avoided losses of more than $40 million from inside information he received on Dean Foods. The authorities said that from 2008 through 2014, Mr. Walters had an uncanny ability to make well-placed and timely trades, before significant corporate events, in shares of what was then the country\u2019s leading milk processor."]

This is the fifth time that Mr. Walters, known as Billy, has tangled with the law enforcement authorities.

["business", "A Day\u2019s Strike Seeks to Raise Fast-Food Pay - The New York Times From New York to several Midwestern cities, thousands of fast-food workers have been holding one-day strikes during peak mealtimes, quickly drawing national attention to their demands for much higher wages. What began in Manhattan eight months ago first spread to Chicago and Washington and this week has hit St. Louis, Kansas City, Detroit and Flint, Mich. On Wednesday alone, workers picketed McDonald\u2019s, Taco Bell, Popeye\u2019s and Long John Silver\u2019s restaurants in those cities with an ambitious agenda: pay of $15 an hour, twice what many now earn. These strikes, which are planned for Milwaukee on Thursday, carry the flavor of Occupy Wall Street protests and are far different from traditional unionization efforts that generally focus on a single workplace. The national campaign, underwritten with millions of dollars from the Service Employees International Union, aims to mobilize workers \u2014 all at once \u2014 in numerous cities at hundreds of restaurants from two dozen chains. None of the nation\u2019s 200,000-plus fast-food restaurants are unionized. The strategists know they want to achieve a $15 wage, but they seem to be ad-libbing on ways to get there. Perhaps they will seek to unionize workers at dozens of restaurants, although some labor leaders scoff at that idea because the turnover rate among fast-food employees is about 75 percent a year. Or the strategists and strikers might press city councils to enact a special \u201cliving wage\u201d for fast-food restaurants. Or perhaps by continually disrupting the fast-food marketplace from counter to counter across the country, they can get McDonald\u2019s, KFC and others to raise wages to end the ruckus. The protests\u2019 organizers acknowledge that yet another goal is to push Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and pressure state legislatures to raise the state minimums."]

Dozens of workers, joined by members of various unions and community groups, picketed in front of McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell, shouting chants like, \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, $7.40 has got to go\u201d \u2014 the amount per hour many of them are paid. \u201cFifteen dollars an hour would be great \u2013 we\u2019d be able to pay our living costs,\u201d said Christopher Drumgold, 32, a father of two who earns $7.40 an hour after a year working at a McDonald\u2019s on Seven Mile Road in Detroit. \u201cOn what I\u2019m earning right now you have to choose between paying your rent and eating the next day.\u201d"]

(The median pay for fast-food workers nationwide is $9.05 an hour.) Industry officials say a $15 wage might drive many restaurants out of business and cause restaurant owners to hire fewer workers and replace some with automation \u2014 perhaps by using more computerized gadgets where customers punch in the orders themselves. Scott DeFife, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said the one-day walkouts were not really strikes, but rather public-relations-minded protests that have caused very few restaurants to close. \u201cIt is an effort to demonize the entire industry in order to make some organizing and political points,\u201d he said, adding that only a small percentage of restaurant jobs pay the minimum wage. He said most of those positions were held by workers younger than 25. Organizers of the protests \u2014 called Fast Food Forward in New York and Fight for 15 in Chicago \u2014 say that it seems to be catching fire. Some fast-food workers in St. Louis, inspired by the strikes in New York and Chicago, held their own one-day walkout. \u201cThings are going phenomenally. Workers all over the country are taking action in an industry where there had literally been no action or traction a year ago,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, which played a crucial role organizing the first fast-food strike in New York last November."]

One Taco Bell worker, Sharise Stitt, 27, joined the strike, saying the $8.09 she earns after five years there was insufficient to support her family. She was evicted from her Detroit apartment and moved her family to her sister\u2019s house in Taylor, Mich. That means a 45-minute commute each way and a gas bill of $50 every four days.

Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said he doubted the fast-food strikes would result in unionization. While unions might be excited by the current burst of enthusiasm, he said unions had learned to be cautious, adding, \u201cYou pour in a lot of resources, saying, \u2018Yes it does work,\u2019 and a year later it disintegrates.\u201d"]

["business/media", "Tronc Feud Escalates as Billionaire Investor Demands Access to Records - The New York Times Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire doctor in Los Angeles and a major shareholder in the newspaper publisher Tronc, has sent a letter to Tronc\u2019s board accusing the company of \u201cpoor corporate governance\u201d and asking for access to its books and records. The move escalates an increasingly public feud between Dr. Soon-Shiong, Tronc\u2019s vice chairman, and Michael W. Ferro Jr., its nonexecutive chairman, who have vied to increase their stakes in the company in apparent attempts to outmaneuver each other for control. Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s investment firm, Nant Capital, invested $70.5 million last May to acquire roughly 13 percent of Tronc, then called Tribune Publishing, at $15 a share. The move was made as part of the company\u2019s effort to fend off a takeover by Gannett. Gannett ultimately dropped its pursuit of Tronc \u2014 which owns The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune, among other newspapers \u2014 in November. But this month, Tronc removed Dr. Soon-Shiong from the slate of directors whom shareholders can vote to elect at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April. And last week, Tronc said it had agreed to buy back the 3.75 million shares held by the investment firm Oaktree Capital, a longtime shareholder in the company. As part of the filing announcing the agreement, Tronc said it was raising the cap on the stake that Mr. Ferro could acquire to 30 percent, from 25 percent."]

The letter also says that Nant Capital \u201cis troubled by the company\u2019s corporate governance, or lack thereof.\u201d Nant believes that \u201cpoor corporate governance\u201d is among the reasons that Tronc\u2019s stock is trading \u201cat a meaningful discount\u201d to the price Nant paid for its shares, the letter adds.

The letter, which was sent on Monday, raises a number of concerns, including that Tronc had moved forward the date of its annual meeting by more than 30 days, a decision the letter contends was \u201cdesigned to limit shareholders\u2019 ability to nominate directors.\u201d The letter also says that Tronc\u2019s board notified Dr. Soon-Shiong that it had not renominated him \u201conly after the nomination window had closed.\u201d That would have prevented Dr. Soon-Shiong from putting forward an alternate slate of directors. In a statement, Tronc acknowledged it had received Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s letter and denounced its claims. \u201cWe have reviewed it, have found it to be filled with misstatements and baseless innuendo, and intend to respond to Nant Capital as promptly as possible,\u201d the statement said."]

["us", "Drilling Is Making Oklahoma as Quake Prone as California - The New York Times Californians have lived with the risk of a damaging earthquake for centuries. Now Oklahomans, and some Kansans, face the same threat, federal seismologists said on Monday. In an assessment released by the United States Geological Survey, experts said the chance of a destructive temblor in the next year is as great in parts of north-central Oklahoma and southern Kansas \u2014 where oil-and-gas operations have set off man-made quakes for about five years \u2014 as it is in the shakiest parts of quake-prone California. The warning came in the agency\u2019s map of earthquake risks, a document that for the first time included the prospects for human-caused quakes. \u201cBy including human-induced events, our assessment of earthquake hazards has significantly increased in parts of the U.S.,\u201d Mark Petersen, the chief of the agency\u2019s Natural Seismic Hazard Mapping Project, said in a news release. Four other states where waste disposal has led to human-induced quakes \u2014 Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas \u2014 face considerably smaller risks of damaging tremors, the agency said. About seven million people live in the areas at risk of a human-induced earthquake, most of them in Oklahoma and Texas. Over the last 15 years, those states have experienced an explosion in oil and gas production, which releases huge amounts of toxic wastewater. That wastewater is disposed of by re-injecting it into the ground, into rock formations thousands of feet below the surface, increasing the pressure on existing subterranean faults, and causing them to slip and produce tremors."]
["us", "Along with the economic boom from oil and gas exploration, Oklahoma has experienced a rising number of earthquakes. In an average year, Oklahoma has historically had fewer than two quakes of magnitude 3 or greater \u2014 roughly the level at which a tremor can be felt. Kansas has had even fewer such shocks. But last year, Oklahoma recorded 907 quakes at magnitude 3 and above, and Kansas registered 54. Oklahoma now ranks behind only Alaska in earthquake frequency, followed by California. Three of the quakes this year, measured at magnitudes of 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1, were among the largest in Oklahoma\u2019s history. Including Oklahoma and southern Kansas on the map reinforces what the Geological Survey\u2019s scientists have said for some time: The huge number of small, human-caused quakes in the two states may have set the stage for a larger, more destructive one. The area of greatest risk, the agency stated, is a swath of rural land along the Oklahoma-Kansas border that has been repeatedly rocked by tremors. Because the area is thinly populated, damage has so far has been limited. The assessment said that in that area, there is a 5 to 12 percent chance of a level six earthquake on the Mercalli index of intensity, which rates the potential for damage. Level six indicates a strong earthquake that is widely felt, but that does not cause much damage. Level seven can cause moderate damage in ordinary buildings and considerable damage in lesser ones."]
["us", "But the area of risk also extends through the central part of the state toward Oklahoma City, where the rate of quakes has recently dropped. Experts estimated the one-year risk there at between 5 and 10 percent. Twenty other sites in the eastern and central United States have also experienced human-induced quakes, the agency said, but the threat of larger quakes in these areas is small, the agency said. The Geological Survey emphasized that earthquake prediction was an uncertain science, and that some studies suggested that the maximum magnitude of human-induced quakes was less than that of natural ones. Much of the region\u2019s boom in oil and gas production comes from wells that employ hydraulic fracturing of shale deep in the earth, a process commonly called fracking. But the scientists said those wells likely are responsible for only a tiny share of quakes; fracking-related earthquakes typically are too small to be felt. In both Oklahoma and Kansas, some of the tremors over the last five years have rivaled the largest in their histories. This year, Oklahoma has recorded more than 160 quakes with a magnitude of 3 or more. But the pace appears to have slowed after the state\u2019s oil and gas regulator, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, effectively imposed steep reductions in underground waste disposal in February and March. Earthquake scientists have nevertheless warned that the risk of a larger quake does not necessarily drop in lock step with a decline in smaller ones. The forces that have been loosed underground, they say, can take years to sort themselves out."]
["us", "The Geological Survey report also said the chances of a damaging natural earthquake had risen in some parts of the United States. Scientists noted an increase in the number of small tremors along the New Madrid fault, near Memphis, which in the early 1800s was the site of one of the nation\u2019s largest earthquakes. The increase in tremors there has slightly raised the prospects of a larger quake, the scientists said."]

WASHINGTON \u2014 Sometimes, the internal dynamics of White House debates on military action are cloaked in mystery, emerging years afterward in the memoirs of participants. Other times, the details surface quickly, if someone leaks a version of events. And in some cases, the pictures tell the tale. Such is the case with the Obama administration\u2019s anguished deliberations over how to respond to the Syrian civil war, the deadly chemical weapons attack outside Damascus last month and the president\u2019s own wrestling with whether to seek Congressional approval for a military strike. Photographers have captured many dramatic moments of the last week, when President Obama abruptly halted his march to military action, announced he would seek the blessing of Congress for a strike, and then dispatched the members of his war council to Capitol Hill to make his case to skeptical lawmakers. In the images of tense meetings in the Oval Office and the Situation Room, or under the lights in House and Senate hearing rooms, the faces and body language of the president\u2019s men (they are mostly men) are often a guide to their conflicting opinions on the best way forward."]

But in this case, the images are corroborated by the accounts of several of the participants. The White House, by posting the work of its official photographer, Pete Souza, on Flickr hours after events rather than years later in a memoir or coffee-table book, is providing what amounts to a real-time visual account of a historic debate. During two days of hearings on Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry was the undisputed big dog, eclipsing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who flanked Mr. Kerry at the witness table like a pair of bookends. Whether jabbing the air to emphasize a piece of intelligence or brusquely cutting off a Republican congressman who questioned his judgment given his past antiwar views, Mr. Kerry was every inch the former prosecutor making the case against President Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Hagel, who has been more reluctant than Mr. Kerry to act militarily in Syria, answered questions when asked, but seemed occasionally unsure of his facts, such as when he said in answer to a question from a House member that Russia supplied Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. The Pentagon later walked that back, saying that Mr. Hagel had been referring to Russia\u2019s role as a longtime supplier of conventional weapons."]
["world/middleeast", "Mr. Hagel\u2019s shaky performance was reminiscent of his Senate confirmation hearings, when his uncertain answers prompted questions about his potential effectiveness as a spokesman for Mr. Obama\u2019s military policy. As for General Dempsey, who has made clear his skepticism about military action in lengthy letters to Congress, he appeared to want to disappear behind his medals and ribbons. Looking down, offering monosyllabic answers, and dispensing with an opening statement, the general left little doubt that he was simply carrying out orders. General Dempsey, it turns out, was not the only senior official harboring reservations. Mr. Obama, his aides say, was ambivalent about carrying out a military strike with a shaky legal case and without the imprimatur of the United Nations Security Council. Those doubts intensified later in the week when the British Parliament voted against military action. On Friday, Aug. 30, a day after that vote, Mr. Kerry stepped to the lectern at the State Department to deliver his most thunderous case yet for acting against Mr. Assad. Hours later, the president, flanked by leaders from the Baltic republics, offered a more muted case for action. That evening, Mr. Obama asked his chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, to take a stroll with him on the South Lawn of the White House. He broke the news to Mr. McDonough that he was thinking of asking Congress to sign off on a strike against Syria."]

To Mr. Obama\u2019s left, was Rob Nabors, his deputy chief of staff and former legislative liaison, whose job is to shepherd Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda through Congress. To his right was Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser who has long advocated a robust response to Syria. Standing behind the sofa, watching over the debate, was Mr. McDonough.

["dining", "With Couscous, Einat Admony\u2019s Patience Pays Off - The New York Times Coaxing dry, coarse semolina into soft, fluffy couscous is a marathon, not a sprint. This explains why so many cooks use the instant variety; making fresh couscous from scratch requires a patience for repetition \u2014 hand-rolling, sifting, steaming \u2014 and attention to the minute changes in the flour\u2019s temperament. As in any race, the start is crucial. Too much water, introduced too quickly, and the grains will stick together, turning to mush instead of tender clusters. Some cooks spritz the flour as they would a rare and delicate orchid, but the chef Einat Admony, who owns several restaurants in New York, doesn\u2019t bother with all that. \u201cI like to have the feel of it in my hands,\u201d she said in the kitchen of her NoLIta restaurant, Balaboosta. Ms. Admony poured a cup of water over her fist and let it run into a large bowl of flour. She spread her fingers apart and expertly combed through the damp semolina, rubbing the flour in her hands to encourage gritty clumps, spinning her palms around the sides of the bowl and winding her way to the center. In September, Ms. Admony plans to open Kish-Kash, a West Village restaurant that will specialize in fresh couscous. There will be a communal table, and counter service at lunchtime. The couscous will be served with a variety of dishes inspired by the foods of Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. \u201cI want it to feel like Shabbat at my house,\u201d said Ms. Admony, 45, who grew up just outside Tel Aviv with her Iranian mother and Yemeni father."]

It comes in a pile, pale and airy, with pickles and condiments, next to Tripoli-style fish shimmering with preserved lemon and harissa, or tender mafroum. Ms. Admony makes mafroum, a North African specialty, by stuffing potatoes with beef and herbs, frying the packages and braising them in a rich tomato sauce, tingling with cinnamon. \u201cMafroum is very old-school,\u201d she said, \u201cand couscous with mafroum is my favorite food in the world. It\u2019s my craving.\u201d Unlike both Israeli couscous, a small pasta that Ms. Admony does not consider to be couscous at all, and Moroccan couscous, which is traditionally steamed over a meaty broth, Ms. Admony\u2019s couscous is steamed with plain water. \u201cWhen it\u2019s perfect, it\u2019s so delicious you can even eat it plain,\u201d she said. When Ms. Admony was 8, she helped with kitchen tasks at home: picking small stones from an aluminum tray of nigella seeds, or white pith from pomegranate seeds. And she learned the basics of making fresh couscous from a Moroccan neighbor in her three-story apartment building. Even in homes where couscous is hand-rolled, the dish is still considered a rare treat, Ms. Admony said, and because of the labor-intensive process, it is hardly ever made from scratch in restaurants."]
["dining", "In the tiny kitchen at Balaboosta, Ms. Admony took up more handfuls of wet semolina. She slid her palms together as if she were washing them under running water, letting the flour fall back into the bowl in clumps. Working in batches, she pushed these clumps through a wide-meshed sieve. (Any large, doughy pieces left behind would be fried for a family meal.) What she packed into the steamer did look like couscous, but it was not there yet. The grains were still small and they needed to swell with more moisture. She steamed her first round for a half-hour, before tipping the hot semolina back into a large bowl so the starch could cool and rest. Then she mixed in more water, passed the mass through the sieve and steamed it a second time. Couscous-making techniques vary from home to home, and while some cooks may pass the semolina through the strainer only once, others repeat the process three times for an airy, even grain.

["us", "Quake Leaves Cracks in Washington Monument, Closing It for Now - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 While the angst over whether this country\u2019s political system is broken seems likely to go on for the foreseeable future, it gave way to some degree Wednesday to more immediate concerns about how badly the Washington Monument had been cracked. The monument was damaged Tuesday by a magnitude-5.8 earthquake that rattled nerves across much of the East Coast, particularly the parts that directly experienced the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Although the quake\u2019s epicenter was less than 100 miles away, the Washington metropolitan area suffered mostly minor damage to homes, schools, office buildings and other businesses, and most of the region\u2019s infrastructure was unscathed. The National Cathedral appeared to be the hardest hit, with fallen capstones, broken statues and cracks in several flying buttresses. However, fractures in the walls of the Washington Monument, a towering icon of American strength and influence, had the potential to become the only vestige of the earthquake to capture more than fleeting national attention. While schools were closed, most of Washington returned to normal on Wednesday. But the monument, which at more than 555 feet is the world\u2019s tallest stone structure, was closed to visitors so that engineers could hover in helicopters and examine its interior walls to determine the extent of the cracks in its peak."]
["us", "\u201cWe\u2019re not sure how long it will take,\u201d said Bill Line, a spokesman for the National Parks Service, when asked when the monument might reopen. \u201cThe engineers are going up there today. They may need to go tomorrow. And they may need to go again the day after that. But until we figure out how badly the structure has been damaged, no one else will be going up other than them.\u201d In any event, fewer people have been going to the top. The number of annual visitors has declined from a high in the 1980s of some 1.3 million to fewer than 650,000 last year. Several longtime Washington residents milling around the obelisk Wednesday admitted they had never visited the site but decided to walk by on their way to other monuments, hoping they would be able to see the damage. Among them was Perlean Williams, who celebrated her 65th birthday by visiting the city\u2019s newest monument, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at this thing my whole life,\u201d she said, waving a dismissive hand at the monument, which honors America\u2019s first president and was finished in 1884. Echoing the views of many African-Americans who have long hoped the capital would pay similar tribute to their struggles, she added, \u201cNo offense to George Washington, but the Martin Luther King Memorial really means something to me.\u201d"]
["us", "That is not to say no one comes to pay their respects to the father of the country. Although a post-9/11 security system has reduced the number of visitors, Mr. Line said the National Park Service gives away an average of 1,700 tickets a day to people who want to ride the elevator to the top for the sweeping views. That is what brought Krishna Murthy Gopalan all the way from southern India. \u201cI saw New York from the Empire State Building,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I wanted to see Washington the same way.\u201d For many, however, it was enough to see that the monument was still standing. Colleen Tully of Boston said the brief panic caused by the earthquake brought back memories of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \u201cSure we\u2019re disappointed the monument is closed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it would be really upsetting if it had fallen over.\u201d Carrie Cohen echoed that thought. \u201cPeople may say the monument is broken like our political system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the fact is, it\u2019s still standing and so are we. \u201cConsidering all the catastrophes around the world,\u201d she added, \u201cit would be silly to get upset about a few cracks in a monument.\u201d"]
["sports/olympics", "A Victory Lap in Hong Kong for China\u2019s Gold Medalists - The New York Times HONG KONG \u2014 Moving swiftly to capitalize on the success of Chinese athletes at the Olympics, government officials in Beijing will send most of China\u2019s gold medalists to Hong Kong next week, ahead of legislative elections here on Sept. 7. The athletes\u2019 visit, announced Wednesday by the Hong Kong government, comes as democracy advocates here are struggling to hold on to their 26 seats in the 60-member Legislature. A resurgent Chinese national pride has helped pro-Beijing candidates this summer. If pro-democracy politicians fall below 21 seats, then the Chinese government\u2019s allies will be in position to reshape election laws and other legislation in ways that would further cement Beijing\u2019s control. Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, specifies that any amendments must obtain the support of two-thirds of the legislature\u2019s members, or 40 of the 60 members now. By obtaining 21 of 60 seats, the Democrats provide any changes to the Basic Law. \u201cWhether they come or not, the whole Olympics has raised Hong Kong people\u2019s sense of being part of China and their sense of pride in being Chinese,\u201d said Choy So-yuk, a leader and candidate of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. After 156 years as a British colony, Hong Kong became a semi-autonomous Chinese territory in 1997."]
["sports/olympics", "Advocates of democracy consistently win a majority of votes cast by the general public in legislative elections. But a byzantine electoral system, introduced by the British to limit pressures for local rule and preserved since 1997 by China, has ensured that a legislative majority remains in the hands of a coalition of the pro-Beijing commercial elite and pro-Beijing labor and community activists. Yeung Sum, a former chairman of the Democratic Party and longtime critic of Beijing who is seeking re-election, said that he worried that gold medalists might campaign with pro-Beijing candidates. Thomas Chow, the director of the Hong Kong Leisure and Cultural Services Department, said the city\u2019s decision to invite the Chinese athletes had nothing to do with the elections. \u201cEven if there were no election this year, we would still invite the gold medalists,\u201d he said. The athletes will arrive on Aug. 29, five days after the closing ceremony in Beijing, and stay for three days. They are to attend a welcome ceremony at Hong Kong Stadium and demonstrate their sports in several areas that are likely to be political battlegrounds. Democracy activists did well in the 2004 elections, which were held just one year after hundreds of thousands of residents had protested the planned introduction of stringent internal security legislation favored by Beijing. The legislation was withdrawn, but many politicians expect a new version to be introduced in coming years to replace colonial laws still on the books."]
["sports/olympics", "Predicting next month\u2019s elections is extremely difficult, said Michael DeGolyer, the director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, a coalition of academics studying changes under Chinese rule. The pro-democracy camp has fragmented into a series of rival parties all battling for the same voters, including seven pro-democracy tickets on Hong Kong Island alone. But the pro-Beijing camp has also divided, with the Federation of Trade Unions distancing itself from the Democratic Alliance and fielding rival candidates. Poverty and income inequality have unexpectedly emerged as the top issues in campaign forums. High food and energy prices have pushed up inflation to 6.1 percent in the 12 months through June, hurting the poor in particular. Cyd Ho, a pro-democracy candidate, said the Olympic athletes\u2019 visit would probably hearten voters already inclined to support pro-Beijing parties. But she questioned whether voters worried about economic issues would take note. \u201cThe middle-of-the-road swing voters,\u201d she said, \u201cwill not be swayed by gold medals.\u201d"]
["world/middleeast", "Top Saddam Hussein Aide Reported Killed in Northern Iraq - The New York Times BAGHDAD \u2014  An Iraqi provincial governor said Friday that militiamen had killed Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking official from Saddam Hussein\u2019s government who was still on the loose, in clashes in a mountainous region of northern Iraq. News of Mr. Douri\u2019s death has been announced several times by different authorities over the years, and officials cautioned that confirmation would not come until DNA testing had been conducted. The announcement was made by the governor of Salahuddin Province. Its capital is Tikrit, Mr. Hussein\u2019s hometown, which was recently liberated from the Islamic State. A representative for one of the militias involved in the fighting on Friday, Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq, said a body that fighters believed was Mr. Douri\u2019s was on its way to Baghdad on Friday evening for DNA testing. The elusive Mr. Douri, who in recent years has led a Sunni insurgent group that last year aligned with the Islamic State as it took over Mosul, was once declared dead, in 2005, by his own Baath Party. Mr. Douri\u2019s insurgent group is made up of former intelligence officers and elite soldiers from the old Baathist government, and is called the Men of the Army of the Naqshbandia Order, often called J.R.T.N., the group\u2019s initials in Arabic. The group\u2019s role was said to be important in helping the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seize territory last year. But Men of the Army is believed to have been marginalized as the Islamic State consolidated power through its sheer brutality."]
["world/middleeast", "Mr. Douri would have been in his early 70s, and was an interior minister under Mr. Hussein. He was the king of clubs in the deck of cards that was issued to American soldiers in 2003 and carried the faces of the top leaders being sought by American-led military forces."]
["world/africa", "Power in Tunisia Changes Hands 2 Times in 24 Hours - The New York Times TUNIS \u2014 Tanks, police officers and gangs of newly deputized young men wielding guns held the deserted streets of Tunis Saturday night after a day of sporadic rioting and gunfire. Power changed hands for the second time in 24 hours, and the swift turnabout raised new questions about what kind of government might emerge from the chaos engulfing Tunisia. The interim government named Friday had hoped that the toppling of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who fled the country, would satisfy protesters, but continued unrest Saturday made clear that they were determined to chase his allies from power as well. Bursts of gunfire rang out through the capital all day Saturday, and a patient discharged from a major hospital here reported that the emergency room was packed with people suffering gunshot wounds. After a hail of machine-gun fire in the late afternoon in downtown Tunis, snipers were visible on the rooftop of the Interior Ministry, aiming down at the Boulevard Bourguiba. Human rights groups said that they had confirmed dozens of deaths at the hands of security forces even before the biggest street battle began Friday, and on Saturday residents huddled in their homes for fear of the police."]
["world/africa", "The tumbling political succession started Friday when Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi announced on state television that the president was gone and that he was taking over. Then, on Saturday morning, Mr. Ghannouchi, an ally of Mr. Ben Ali, abruptly announced that he was surrendering the reins of government to the speaker of Parliament, complying with succession rules spelled out in the Tunisian Constitution. Now the speaker, Fouad Mebazaa, is expected to hold elections to form a new government within 60 days. The shake-up underscored the power vacuum left here after the end of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s 23 years of authoritarian rule \u2014 a transition of dizzying speed that Tunisians view with both hope and fear. With Tunisia\u2019s relatively large middle class, high level of education and secular culture, some here argue that their country is poised to become the first true Arab democracy. And commentators around the Middle East pondered the potential regional implications of the success of Tunisia\u2019s protests; Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s fall marked the first time that street demonstrations had overcome an Arab autocrat. \u201cWill Tunisia be the first domino to fall?\u201d asked a headline on the Web site of the news channel Al Jazeera. But others at home and abroad worried that Tunisia could slide into chaos, laying the groundwork for a new strongman to emerge. Mr. Ben Ali was viewed in the West as a reliable ally in the fight against the Islamic extremism flourishing in other parts of North Africa, and in Washington, national security experts said extremist groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb could capitalize on the disorder to find a new foothold."]
["world/africa", "For now, though, the political field remains conspicuously empty. Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s pervasive network of secret police had succeeded in effectively eliminating or co-opting any truly viable opposition or political institution. The former president also long ago wiped away the Islamist groups that form the main grass-roots opposition in most Arab countries. \u201cThere are very few players to keep track of,\u201d said Michael Koplow, an expert on Tunisia who has written about the uprising for Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cIf there were new free elections, it is unclear whether there is anyone qualified to run who the people would accept. It is wide open.\u201d There is also no apparent leader or spokesman for the four-week-old protest against joblessness and government corruption that forced Mr. Ben Ali from power. The protests erupted spontaneously after the Dec. 17 suicide by self-immolation of a college-educated street vendor in the Western city of Sidi Bouzid frustrated by the lack of opportunity (the police had confiscated his wares because he did not have a permit). They spread through online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. And they accelerated as demonstrators shared homemade digital videos of each confrontation with the police. \u201cThere are no leaders, that is the good thing,\u201d one protester declared Friday as thousands crowded around the Interior Ministry just before the police imposed martial law and Mr. Ben Ali left the country."]
["world/africa", "Protesters immediately turned against the unconstitutional ascension of Mr. Ghannouchi, arguing that he was a crony of Mr. Ben Ali who came from the same hometown of Sousse. It remains unclear if critics will be satisfied with the switch in power to Mr. Mebazaa, who has presided over a Parliament dominated exclusively by Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s ruling party and like almost every other Tunisian elected official, owes his career to the former president. There were reports in Arabic news outlets this weekend that it was the Tunisian military that finally triggered the unwinding of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s government. As the demonstrations escalated on Thursday afternoon, the country\u2019s top military official, Gen. Rachid Ammar, is said to have refused to shoot protesters. That afternoon, the military began pulling its tanks and personnel out of downtown Tunis, leaving the police and other security forces loyal to the ruling party to take their place as President Ben Ali delivered his final speech pleading, in effect, for another chance. The tanks returned after Mr. Ben Ali left the country. On Saturday afternoon, there were some signs that General Ammar himself may now have an eye on politics. On Facebook, a staging ground of the street revolt, almost 1,700 people had clicked that they \u201clike\u201d a Web page named \u201cGeneral Rachid Ammar President\u201d and emblazoned with his official photographs. Still, the Tunisian military is relatively small compared with the armies of most countries in the region and is far less pervasive here than internal security forces, and so far neither General Ammar nor any other military figure has publicly stepped forward to try to lead the country."]
["world/africa", "Meanwhile, Tunisians abroad and exiled opposition leaders reveled in the chance for a change. Several thousand Tunisians demonstrated in Paris on Saturday at the Place de la R\u00e9publique calling for real democracy and celebrating Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s downfall. Exiled opposition leaders, many of whom have lived abroad for decades in France or Britain, prepared to return in the hope of rekindling their movements. Perhaps foremost among them was Rachid al-Ghannouchi, a progressive Islamic leader who founded the Hizb al-Nahdah, or Renaissance Party. He was imprisoned twice in the 1980s and granted asylum in Britain in 1993. \u201cThe dictatorship has fallen,\u201d Mr. Ghannouchi told Reuters. \u201cThere is nothing to stop me returning to my country after 22 years of exile.\u201d In Egypt, critics of President Hosni Mubarak rushed to embrace the Tunisian example, noting that their country shared the combination of an autocratic ruler, rampant corruption and a large population of frustrated youth. Egyptians traded phone messages like \u201cMubarak, oh, Mubarak, your plane is waiting for you!\u201d and posted images of the Tunisian flag to their Facebook pages. A major opposition group, led by Mohamed El Baradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency,  merged the Egyptian and Tunisian flags into one on its Web site. One group of young Egyptians set up a Facebook page calling on their fellow citizens to make January 25 \u201cThe day of revolution against torture, poverty, corruption and unemployment.\u201d \u201cIf you care about Egypt, if you want your rights, join us and participate and enough silence,\u201d the page said."]
["world/africa", "Still, many commentators around the Arab world wondered if it might be too soon to celebrate, given the continuing violence in Tunisia and the lack of an obvious leader. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the Tunisia of yesterday has opened up, or is about to plunge into a deep sea of the unknown and be added to the series of Arab disasters that don\u2019t end,\u201d Tarek al-Hamid wrote in Asharq al-Awsat, a paper with a Saudi owner. \u201cNo one will cry over Ben Ali, but the prayer is for Tunisia not to fall into a quagmire of crises with a bleak future.\u201d Saudi Arabia said Saturday that it had welcomed Mr. Ben Ali and his family. France, the former colonial power in Tunisia, made it clear that it did not want to risk inflaming its large Tunisian immigrant population by accepting the former president. And on Saturday, the French government said that members of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s family who had taken refuge at a hotel at Disneyland Paris were not welcome either. \u201cBen Ali\u2019s family members on French soil have no reason to stay,\u201d a government spokesman said. \u201cThey are going to leave it.\u201d French media said the family members were later seen leaving the hotel. Meanwhile, reports of unrest continued Saturday in Tunisia, with the Arab news media reporting that hundreds of prisoners were freed after a jailhouse riot in a resort town and that more than 40 were killed in a fire at another prison set by an inmate hoping to escape amid the country\u2019s chaos."]

The post again passed on to a member of the founding Walton family. Greg Penner, 45, will replace Rob Walton, who has been chairman for 23 years and is a son of Walmart\u2019s founder, Sam Walton. Mr. Penner has held several positions at Walmart, including senior vice president for finance and strategy for Walmart.com and chief financial officer in Japan.

Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen and Company, the financial services company, said in a research note that Mr. Penner could probably use his background in e-commerce and finance to balance growth, investment and capital returns. \u201cHe brings a younger energy to Walmart, while continuing family tradition,\u201d Mr. Chen said. Walmart\u2019s board has been criticized for a lack of independence of its board from the company\u2019s management, at a time Walmart faces questions over a bribery scandal in Mexico, executive compensation and slowing growth at its stores in the United States and overseas.

Shareholder resolutions submitted this year call for the board to be led by a chairman who is independent of family or business ties to Walmart and to allow shareholders to make board nominations. Another resolution calls for more transparency on management compensation plans and programs. \u201cTens of thousands of associates receive so little each year that they are eligible for food stamps. That\u2019s a double standard and that has to stop,\u201d said Mary Watkins, a Walmart employee, shareholder and member of the labor union affiliate group, Our Walmart, who presented the resolution on executive compensation at the shareholders\u2019 meeting.

For 60 minutes Thursday, Mr. Kashkari, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Treasury official, portrayed Mr. Brown\u2019s governorship as a failure and California as a state in distress. Again and again, brandishing statistics, he described a state with a crippling business environment, staggering poverty and some of the worst public schools and prisons in the nation. \u201cHis 40 years in government have left him out of touch with California middle-class families,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said of Mr. Brown, jabbing his fingers in the air. \u201cToday our schools are ranked 45th out of the 50 states. We are No. 1 in poverty.\u201d Mr. Brown responded with an aggressive account of a successful term in office. He said California\u2019s economy had greatly improved, partisan bickering in Sacramento had ended and the state had moved out of a severe deficit and was beginning to pay down its long-term debt. \u201cHe likes to make the construct that we\u2019re not making progress,\u201d Mr. Brown said of his opponent. \u201cWell, we are making progress.

At 76, Mr. Brown is seeking his second consecutive term as governor; the state\u2019s term limits bar him from serving a third. (He was also governor during the late 1970s.) If Mr. Kashkari needed another reminder of the challenge he faces, a Field Poll released Thursday morning showed Mr. Brown leading him by 16 points, 50 to 34. Perhaps even more troublesome for Mr. Kashkari, the poll found that nearly 60 percent of respondents did not know enough about him to offer a favorable or unfavorable opinion."]

When Mr. Brown said he would sign a bill just passed by the Legislature that would impose a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags, Mr. Kashkari said he would veto it if he were governor and cited it as an example of Sacramento wasting time while the state was in trouble. Again and again, Mr. Kashkari criticized the ambitious high-speed rail project from San Francisco to Los Angeles that Mr. Brown has pushed even as it has lost popularity with voters and some lawmakers, and even as Republicans in Washington have said they would refuse to fund it. Mr. Kashkari said he would cancel the project if elected and cast it as Mr. Brown\u2019s personal crusade. \u201cMake no mistake about it: He is raising your gas prices, you at home, he\u2019s raising your gas prices to create the vanity project, what I call the crazy train,\u201d he said."]

["sports/basketball", "Special Night for Collins, and a Win for the Nets - The New York Times DENVER \u2014 Jason Collins trotted onto the court with 8 minutes 2 seconds left in the fourth quarter Thursday night, the way he had done many times during his 13-year N.B.A. career. However, this instance was different. Among the fans at Pepsi Center who applauded Collins, a 7-foot Nets center, were the parents of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student who was murdered in 1998. Collins wears No. 98 in Shepard\u2019s honor. Collins, the league\u2019s first openly gay player, planned to meet privately with Judy and Dennis Shepard after the Nets\u2019 112-89 victory over the Denver Nuggets. Collins, 35, said before the game that it would be an honor to meet the Shepards and that he was looking forward to a \u201cvery special meeting.\u201d Collins played the game\u2019s final 8:02 and finished with 3 points for the Nets (27-29), who recovered from a 124-80 loss at Portland on Wednesday. He made his only field-goal attempt, a jumper with 1:39 left, and committed four fouls. The Nets stormed out to a 29-8 lead after the first quarter and never looked back. Point guard Deron Williams played the entire quarter and scored 5 points, helping the Nets set the tone. \u201cWe just knew what we had to do,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe team that showed up yesterday wasn\u2019t us and wasn\u2019t what we wanted to be. We had to come out with a better effort tonight, and we were able to do that.\u201d"]
["sports/basketball", "While the Nets\u2019 offense flourished in the first, Denver struggled, going 3 for 18 from the field and setting an N.B.A. season low for first-quarter points. The Nets ended a six-game losing streak against the Nuggets in Denver that dated to Jan. 27, 2007, when Jason Kidd was the Nets\u2019 point guard. Kidd, now the team\u2019s first-year coach, said he was impressed by his players\u2019 ability to press the tempo even though it was their second game in two nights. The Nets outscored the Nuggets by 19-3 in fast-break points and received at least 8 minutes and 3 points from all 13 players. \u201cWe were fresh after back-to-backs,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cNormally we are not fresh, so we don\u2019t have that many fast-break points.\u201d Kidd added that the Nets shared the ball well. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one guy taking it and shooting it,\u201d he said. \u201cGuys were creating movement, and there was a lot of trust offensively.\u201d The Nets led by 59-36 at halftime after shooting 51.2 percent from the field, compared with 32.5 percent by Denver. \u201cI have never seen anything like the whole first half,\u201d Nuggets Coach Brian Shaw said. \u201cIn all of the years that I\u2019ve played, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d Paul Pierce scored 11 of his game-high 18 points in the third quarter as the Nets kept up their first-half performance.

Collins, who was a student at Stanford at the time of Matthew Shepard\u2019s death, said 1998 was a significant year to him and many others. \u201cOf course it is a tragedy what happened, and I just hope it inspires others to move forward,\u201d Collins said. Shaw, who played against Collins in the 2002 finals, when Shaw was with the Los Angeles Lakers and Collins was in his first stint with the Nets, said Collins had always been well liked by his teammates. More important, Shaw said, he is happy for Collins, who signed a 10-day contract with the Nets on Sunday. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that he is able to be himself and not have to hide who he really is,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for him and for the league.\u201d Collins\u2019s teammate Marquis Teague said: \u201cIt\u2019s great.

Almost 600 pages into this, the fifth volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s monumental \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d the 28-year-old would-be novelist finally secures a book deal. He has been writing for a decade with immense seriousness and little success. At one point he reprints a few overwrought paragraphs, which he once hoped would form the beginning of a novel. \u201cThis is what I had,\u201d he writes. \u201cTwo years\u2019 work. I knew every sentence by heart.\u201d From an author renowned for his immense fluency and productivity, this account of his early travails is startling. As we know from many thousands of subsequently published pages, Knausgaard\u2019s dam will break, and in this volume we see the very moment it happens, catalyzed by a conversation overheard in a cafe. \u201cExcited, I made notes. .\u2008.\u2008. In my room, a few hours later, I began to write. .\u2008.\u2008. I continued through the night.\u201d Soon enough, Knausgaard has a draft, and an editor in Oslo agrees to publish it. Enthusiastically reviewed, he finds himself about to appear on national TV. The host con\u00adfesses that he hasn\u2019t had time to read it. \u201cOn the cover it says the book\u2019s about male shame. Could you say a few words about that, do you think?\u201d Knausgaard demurs. \u201c\u200a\u2018I didn\u2019t write the blurb,\u2019 I said. \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was about shame until I saw it.\u2019\u200a\u201d"]
["books/review", "Shame, of course, will turn out to be Knausgaard\u2019s great theme. \u201cMy Struggle\u201d is punctuated by any number of embarrassing or uncomfortable revelations, from the author\u2019s sexual interest in a 13-year-old girl to his troubles with premature ejaculation. This volume takes him from the age of 19 until the dissolution of his first marriage 14 years later, a period of binge drinking, social awkwardness, band practice and writer\u2019s block, in which the only real constant is his literary ambition. \u201cIf I was at the bottom,\u201d he writes, \u201cI had to rise. If I accepted that I belonged down there, in the terrible abyss of immaturity and ineptitude, I had failed.\u201d He ends the TV interview \u201ca little indignant, all I had done was write a novel, you would have thought I had killed someone, judging by his questions.\u201d Knausgaard\u2019s defensive reaction to the interview feels significant. His compulsive self-revelations seem designed to provoke \u2014 and perhaps also foreclose or short-\u00adcircuit \u2014 negative moral evaluation. Shame and publication are strangely knotted together throughout the books of \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d shame that pre-exists publication but that seeks in it some kind of release or repetition. Book 1 begins with the death of the author\u2019s father, a violent alcoholic who ruthlessly mocked his sons and sometimes beat them. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the pain I was afraid of, it was him, his voice, his face, his body, the fury it emitted,\u201d Knausgaard later writes. The sudden absence of a man whose physical presence caused such terror has occasioned the release of this torrent of words, but also haunts it. Daddy has been replaced by the reading public: distant, scornful, sitting in judgment."]
["books/review", "The ego that permits the bad son to write with such seriousness and at such length about his own formation is a sharp weapon when turned inward. The young Knausgaard\u2019s experiences of public abjection are the flip side of a vanity that will not allow him to accept the standards lesser people apply to themselves. He must be the most isolated, the most rejected, the biggest failure. \u201cI had felt I was .\u2008.\u2008. someone who carried thoughts no one else had and which no one must ever know. .\u2008.\u2008. No one could take loneliness away from me.\u201d As a precocious 19-year-old at a writing school in Bergen, he takes criticism badly, reduced to juvenile provocation by the negative appraisals of the other students. When drunk, he is out of control, capable of violence. His self-hatred becomes literal self-laceration. Prompted by a girlfriend\u2019s friendliness to his brother, he stumbles to a bar toilet and repeatedly scores his cheeks with broken glass. For many other self-cutters, it\u2019s important to hide the traces. Not Knausgaard. Out on the street, his Carrie-like appearance provokes shock and fear. Waking the next morning, he sees what he\u2019s done to his face: \u201cI had ruined it. I looked like a monster.\u201d"]
["books/review", "Monstrosity, the possibility that he is definitively \u2014 and visibly \u2014 aberrant or unnatural, haunts Knausgaard in all of these volumes. He almost badgers the reader into telling him not just that he is a bad person, but that he ought to have kept quiet about it. There is something libidinal about this insistence, a species of pride that makes him into a sort of inverted Coriolanus, the stoic warrior who refuses to show his war wounds to the crowd. \u201cMy Struggle\u201d is an ecstatic display of woundedness, a platform on which the author can bleed in public. Early attempts to understand \u201cMy Struggle\u201d tended to see it as an unmediated stream, either an artless outpouring or an attempt at radical transparency. For the reader, Knausgaard\u2019s transgressive self-exposure is a guilty pleasure that shares something with the culture of social media and reality TV, and to this extent both these readings have some merit. But Book 5 seems both more controlled and traditional in form than much of what\u2019s gone before, following the conventions of the bildungsroman to tell the story of an unhappy young man who becomes a writer. Frequently bleak, it is also knowing and often extremely funny. His account of reading Celan\u2019s \u201cDeath Fugue,\u201d in its entirety, to a girl who\u2019s come over to apologize for sleeping with his brother induces a sympathetic embarrassment that is almost exquisite in its intensity. This is writing that is neither artless nor na\u00efvely transparent."]
["books/review", "With only one more book to appear in English, it has become clear that \u201cMy Struggle\u201d is a highly literary work, in the sense that its author makes choices, shapes his material and leaves out many things in telling his story. Knausgaard\u2019s own account of the origin of \u201cMy Struggle\u201d \u00adconcerned a rejection of the fictionality of fiction, a state of crisis in which he needed to abandon the mimetic straitjacket of the novel to achieve authenticity as a writer. As he wrote in Book 2, \u201cjust the thought of a fabricated character in a fabricated plot made me feel nauseous.\u201d This disgust for the traditional procedures of fiction, in which \u201cvoice\u201d is always a pure performance, safely distant from the writing self (never make the mistake of thinking that I, Dostoyevsky, am Raskolnikov, or that I, Nabokov, am Humbert Humbert), is a challenge to Anglophone literary convention, but is far more common in, say, France, where the tradition of autofiction has been an established object of critical inquiry since at least the 1970s. For those of us who have found \u201cMy Struggle\u201d addictive, and want to claim it as a serious work, its shameful nakedness feels important, a kind of writing that asserts the raw value of the \u201cthoughts no one else has and which no one must ever know.\u201d As Knausgaard puts it here, \u201cWhat emerged from this was myself, this was what was me.\u201d"]

Electric pressure cookers is one of the fastest growing kitchen appliance sectors on the market, with sales doubling and tripling over the last four years, according to Robert Wang, the C.E.O. of Instant Pot Company."]
["dining", "When the Instant Pot debuted in 2009, it was one of the first brands to hit North America; electric pressure cookers were already gaining popularity in China. In 2010, approximately 300,000 electric pressure cookers were sold in the United States and Canada, said Dr. Wang. By 2015, that number rose to over three million. (He declined to give exact sales figures, as did representatives from Breville and Cuisinart.) The majority of Instant Pots are sold on Amazon. More than 215,000 units were sold on Amazon Prime Day 2016, in July, when Prime members get discounts on select items, outperforming any other product on the site. Two different models of the Instant Pot currently sit in the top 10 list of Amazon best sellers in the Kitchen and Dining category. So why do electric pressure cookers inspire such a devoted following? I bought one to find out. A confession: I already own a stovetop pressure cooker, the conventional kind that you would heat over a burner and then regulate yourself. It is currently supporting a colony of dust bunnies in the back of my highest cabinet, behind the panini press. I never got over my fear of exploding split-pea soup to use it with any regularity. [ALSO READ: How to Use an Instant Pot] What makes this newest generation of electric pressure cookers different is that it is designed with a slew of self-regulating safety features, including sensors to monitor the unit\u2019s temperature and amount of pressure. All you do is plug it in and tap a button, and it does everything else. It\u2019s as user-friendly as a slow cooker \u2014 except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster."]
["dining", "The promise of a fast, fresh homemade meal is a pressure cooker\u2019s greatest appeal, said Lorna Sass, author of four pioneering cookbooks on pressure cooking, including \u201cPressure Perfect.\u201d [ALSO READ: To Transform Your Weeknight Cooking, Turn On The Instant Pot] \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better, pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food,\u201d Ms. Sass said. After cooking a pork shoulder in the electric pressure cooker, I could easily see why the appliance has struck a chord, with the Paleo community in particular: It cooks large hunks of meat superbly and speedily. After a mere 90 minutes, the meat was spoon tender and deeply flavored, even before I covered the soft shreds with spicy barbecue sauce. The same recipe made in my slow cooker took seven hours, and the meat wasn\u2019t quite as uniformly juicy. It was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer. I continued to play, spending six weeks experimenting with the Instant Pot and a second electric pressure cooker, the Breville Fast Slow Pro. These are the two models recommended by my colleagues at The Sweethome, a product review site owned by The New York Times Company that put six electric pressure cookers through their paces. In terms of performance, I found the two to be more or less the same. Lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes, short ribs fell off the bone in 30, and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes."]
["dining", "Perhaps most convenient, the collagen-rich beef bone broth that took two days to cook down in my slow cooker was ready in an afternoon, without making the whole house smell like soup (which is nice for the first couple of hours but then gets really old). But the electric pressure cooker does have its shortcomings. The most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken. The recipes I tested came out with slack and soggy skin, and either stringy and dry white meat or undercooked dark meat. I did have more success with sake-steamed skinless chicken breasts, which were evenly cooked and perfumed with the delicate rice wine and fresh ginger. A nice dish, though how often does one really want to eat steamed skinless chicken breasts? I didn\u2019t like it much for vegetables either, most of which don\u2019t benefit from the intense pressure of high-heat steam (beets and artichokes being the important exceptions here). Broccoli, kale, zucchini, fennel, brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing. They also took longer to cook than if I had used a skillet on the stove. The manual tells you an ingredient only needs, say, five minutes to cook, but that doesn\u2019t take into account the 10 to 15 minutes required for the machine to build pressure, in addition to the time needed to release the pressure, which brings the total to around 20 minutes. I can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet, some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes. In general, this is a good rule of thumb: If something takes 20 minutes or less to cook conventionally on the stove, use the stove."]
["dining", "Another pressure cooker downside: They just don\u2019t do crisp or crunchy. Although most cookers allow you to brown meats and vegetables on the saut\u00e9 function before cooking, any crunchy bits will wilt under the pressurized steam once you lock on the lid. Though I might use the pressure cooker for potatoes if I were going to mash them, I would never be able to achieve anything like the crisp-edged roasted potatoes I can get in the oven. And in the future, I\u2019ll stick to roasting my whole chickens, so I can crunch on the shards of browned, salty skin. The key to pressure cooker happiness is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal, and which traditionally take hours to get there. For example, I\u2019ll never go back to a Dutch oven for chili, which I made in the electric pressure cooker in an hour starting from dried beans. Same goes for my favorite red lentil soup. Although I didn\u2019t save any time when I tested it, I adored the convenience of not having to watch a pot on the stove. I could turn the pressure cooker on, then go for a run. When I got home, my soup was ready \u2014 a good thing since I was starving. And it\u2019s amazing for chickpeas, which take an hour all told instead of the usual three to four hours for unsoaked beans. \u201cPeople want to use their pressure cookers for everything, but they\u2019re better for some things than others,\u201d Ms. Sass said. \u201cStick to soups, stews, beans and risotto. It makes fabulous risotto.\u201d"]
["dining", "I\u2019d have to agree; Ms. Sass\u2019s recipe for porcini mushroom risotto with peas is excellent, adaptable and about as easy as dinner gets (once you source the dried porcinis and arborio rice, that is). I also like the machine for polenta, which eliminates the stirring (and the splatters of molten blobs). But perhaps the biggest pressure cooker joy I found was for something as simple as hard-cooked eggs. They didn\u2019t cook faster, but even fresh eggs from the farmers\u2019 market peeled effortlessly, without ending up pockmarked and riddled with craters the way they do when I boil them in a pot. This is because the pressure helps inflate the air pocket between the cooked white and the shell, which makes separating the two go more smoothly. I also tried out some of the other functions, including the slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker settings. The unit worked as well as my separate, stand-alone slow cooker, though I can see a future in which I pressure-cook more, and slow-cook less; the results are similar, but one is a whole lot faster. For cooking rice, I preferred both the brown and white rice I made in my separate rice cooker. The pressure cooker was faster, but the rice a bit heavier and chewier. And for yogurt, which I\u2019d gotten into the habit of making every other week on the stove, I have to admit that the machine worked like a dream. So after all that cooking, did I fall in love with the electric pressure cooker?"]

["theater", "Review: \u2018Tuck Everlasting\u2019 Swaps Out the Circle of Life for an Eternally Unspooling Ribbon - The New York Times ATLANTA \u2014 A ballet was once a staple of the American musical in the 1940s, when the form first grew to maturity. But dancers swirling through dream sequences haven\u2019t been seen much for the past few decades or more, as more vernacular movement \u2014 or little dance at all \u2014 has become standard. So it\u2019s a wonder, and a pleasure, that the stirring climax of the new family musical \u201cTuck Everlasting,\u201d making its premiere at the Alliance Theater here, consists of a gorgeous, sweeping ballet that dramatizes the life of its heroine, as she grows from young girl to young woman to motherhood and beyond. More surprising still is the man who created the steps: Casey Nicholaw, the choreographer and director known for his boisterously comic work on musicals like \u201cAladdin\u201d and the cheerfully foul-mouthed blockbuster \u201cThe Book of Mormon.\u201d Refreshingly \u2014 and necessarily \u2014 Mr. Nicholaw brings a softer touch to this period fable about a restless young girl who befriends a family with a mysterious secret. The musical is based on the popular 1975 children\u2019s book of the same title by Natalie Babbitt, which became a Disney film in 2002. There are marked differences between musical and film. (Disney\u2019s theatrical arm is not involved in this production.) The musical, with a book by another somewhat surprising participant, Claudia Shear (\u201cDirty Blonde\u201c), and a score by the team of Chris Miller (music) and Nathan Tysen (lyrics), together best known for \u201cThe Burnt Part Boys,\u201d tracks the book more closely."]
["theater", "While in the movie, the heroine was 15, ripe for a romantic infatuation, in the musical, as in the book, Winnie Foster (Sarah Charles Lewis) is around 11, too young for such flutterings to disturb her when she meets the younger boy of the Tuck family, Jesse (the genial Andrew Keenan-Bolger), who\u2019s 17. Or 104, depending on which way you count. Unavoidable spoiler ahead: Jesse and his family, his mother, Mae (Carolee Carmello at the performance I saw, but now Beth Leavel); father, Angus (Michael Park); and 21-year-old brother, Miles (Robert Lenzi) are all trapped at the age when they first drank from a mysterious spring at the foot of a tree in the New Hampshire woods. In the many decades since they first happened upon this rustic fountain of youth, they have not aged, and they cannot die. (Walt Spangler\u2019s handsome sets are dominated by this tree, which might have been designed by Frank Gehry, with its thick, undulating strips of bark.) We meet the Tucks in a prologue that may confuse anyone not familiar with the story. Each member of the family sings of wanting to \u201cstop time and live like this forever,\u201d but they are manifestly (or not so manifestly) singing from different time periods. The young Mae and Angus are still in the first rapture of their love \u2014 long before children came along. But Miles and Jesse are present, too, more or less the age at which their lives stood still. It\u2019s a slightly bewildering introduction."]
["theater", "The story proper takes place in the late 19th century. Winnie, played with a firm voice and natural spunk by Ms. Lewis, chafes at her constricted life with her overprotective widowed mother (Liza Jaine), which is only mildly softened by the wry, slightly cracked backtalk of her grandmother (a dry Shannon Eubanks). When a carnival proprietor, called only the Man in the Yellow Suit and played with boisterously seedy energy by Terrence Mann, invites Winnie to come see the fair, she throws a tantrum at her mother\u2019s refusal and heads out into the woods, with fateful consequences. Following the lead of a small toad (a cutesy detail wisely excised from the movie), she happens upon Jesse drinking from that pool. For fear that Winnie will reveal their secret and bring them unwanted attention, the Tucks essentially kidnap the girl. After some more foot-stomping, Winnie finds herself warming to the tight-knit clan, and in fascinated thrall to the tale of their strange fate.

Mr. Miller\u2019s rousing music, like his work on \u201cThe Burnt Part Boys,\u201d draws strongly on the sounds of country and folk, with an emphasis on fiddles and piano.

Many of the songs run along similar grooves, relying on laid-back melodies that gradually expand into soaring climaxes.

Chief Says Phone Logs Halted Terror Threats - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014  The director of the National Security Agency told Congress on Wednesday that \u201cdozens\u201d of terrorism threats had been halted by the agency\u2019s huge database of the logs of nearly every domestic phone call made by Americans, while a senator briefed on the program disclosed that the telephone records are destroyed after five years. The director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who heads both the N.S.A. and United States Cyber Command, which runs the military\u2019s offensive and defensive use of cyberweapons, told skeptical members of the Senate Appropriations Committee that his agency was doing exactly what Congress authorized after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. General Alexander said he welcomed debate over the legal justification for the program because \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing to protect American citizens here is the right thing.\u201d He said the agency \u201ctakes great pride in protecting this nation and our civil liberties and privacy\u201d under the oversight of Congress and the courts. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to hide it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect America. So we need your help in doing that. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s just N.S.A. or the administration doing it on its own. This is what our nation expects our government to do for us.\u201d But in his spirited exchanges with committee members, notably Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, General Alexander said he was seeking to declassify many details about the program now that they have been leaked by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who came forward to say he was the source of documents about the phone log program and other classified matters."]
["us", "Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was the first to disclose that the records are eventually destroyed. She said that she planned to hold a classified hearing on Thursday on the program. But at the Wednesday hearing, where testimony about the government\u2019s planned $13 billion spending on cybersecurity was largely swept aside for a discussion of the surveillance program, Ms. Feinstein also revealed that investigators had used the database for purposes beyond countering terrorism, suggesting it might have also been employed in slowing Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Analysts can look at the domestic calling data only if there is a reason to suspect it is \u201cactually related to Al Qaeda or to Iran,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe vast majority of the records in the database are never accessed and are deleted after a period of five years. To look at or use the content of a call, a court warrant must be obtained.\u201d In a robust defense of the phone program, General Alexander said that it had been critical in helping to prevent \u201cdozens of terrorist attacks\u201d both in the United States and abroad and that the intelligence community was considering declassifying examples to better explain the program. He did not clarify whether the records used in such investigations would have been available through individual subpoenas without the database.

He said the entire intelligence community was looking at the security of its networks \u2014 something other government officials vowed to do after the WikiLeaks disclosures three years ago. Under the Prism program, the N.S.A. collects information from American Internet companies like Google without individual court orders if the request is targeted at noncitizens abroad. That program derives from a 2008 surveillance law that was openly debated in Congress. As part of the review from the fallout of leaks about Prism and the phone program, intelligence agencies will seek to determine whether terrorist suspects have increased their use of code words or couriers, have stopped using networks like Facebook or Skype, or have \u201cgone silent\u201d and can no longer be found, current and former senior American officials said separately from the hearing. The review, which will most likely last for months to determine the long-term impact of the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, will also include a \u201ccost benefit analysis\u201d of the programs. \u201cNow that it\u2019s out there, it will be looked at in a different way,\u201d one of the current officials said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s raising questions about whether they have been compromised and whether to continue with them at the same pace.

Philip Mudd, a former F.B.I. deputy director for national security, said that there could be some short-term impact on the programs but that terrorists would find it very hard to function without using electronic communications. \u201cGood luck trying to communicate in this world without leaving a digital exhaust \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, called for the prosecution of journalists who published the classified information in the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Mr. King told Fox News he was specifically talking about Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for The Guardian, whom he accused of threatening to release the names of covert C.I.A. agents. On Twitter, Mr. Greenwald said it was a \u201clie\u201d that he had made such a threat, and shot back with a reference to Mr. King\u2019s past support for the Irish Republican Army: \u201cOnly in America can a renowned and devoted terrorism supporter like Peter King be the arbiter of national security and treason,\u201d he wrote."]

["realestate/commercial", "In Minneapolis, a Blueprint for a Bustling Downtown - The New York Times MINNEAPOLIS \u2014  The building of a nearly $1 billion Minnesota Vikings stadium has become the impetus for resuscitating a barren stretch of this city\u2019s downtown that Gov. Mark Dayton called \u201ca concrete oasis.\u201d Officials broke ground this month on the city\u2019s largest real estate project in two decades, a $400 million mixed-use development going up next to the new stadium. The five-block project, called Downtown East, includes plans for two 18-story office towers for Wells Fargo, a six-level parking ramp, about 24,000 square feet of retail space, 193 apartments and a four-acre urban park near the stadium\u2019s northwest corner. The blueprint for a bustling downtown stands in stark contrast to the status quo: crumbling asphalt parking lots, tired buildings and limited housing. It prompted Ron Tarrel, a neurologist from Chicago, to move this month from his fifth-floor apartment overlooking the Vikings\u2019 demolished Metrodome to a more pristine downtown pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t mind getting away from the beer trolleys and the revving of the Harleys when I\u2019m falling asleep,\u201d he said. Emily Dussault, an actor and city resident, welcomes the redevelopment. \u201cWhen people visit, they anticipate a really exciting and fun place, and we\u2019re like, \u2018No, let\u2019s go somewhere else,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. Ms. Dussault said she steered out-of-town friends to the more artsy neighborhoods of Uptown and Northeast.

Once you get behind the eight ball with a downtown in decay, it\u2019s very, very difficult to turn that around.\u201d Mayor Betsy Hodges is promoting such a turnaround for Minneapolis. \u201cWe have an opportunity that few cities get, a big part of our downtown that\u2019s underdeveloped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 21st-century resurgence, as people reimagine downtown living. They rediscover the value of living in a city and what advantages that brings in terms of recreation, employment, opportunities to live without a car and be around other people.\u201d Mayor Hodges said Downtown East was part of a broader citywide goal to double the number of downtown residents, now 35,000. The redevelopment was made possible in February when the Star Tribune Media Company sold five city blocks \u2014 four to the Minneapolis-based developer Ryan Companies and one to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, the public body overseeing construction of the Vikings stadium. The newspaper\u2019s staff will relocate. Also being shuffled as part of the redevelopment are the 5,000 Wells Fargo employees who will move into the new towers.

Three Broadway heroines, one drawn from a novel, one from a biography, and one from a film, have very different back stories. But they share a common catalyst: Phillipa Soo. The actress this spring will accomplish an unusual trifecta: Three roles she helped originate will be on Broadway at the same time. Oh, and she is just 26 years old. How did that happen? At 21, just a few weeks after graduating from Juilliard in 2012, she auditioned for an experimental electropop opera, \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,\u201d then being developed for an 87-seat theater at Ars Nova, an Off Broadway nonprofit. She got the role. Among the few thousand people who saw the Ars Nova production were two theater directors, Thomas Kail and Pam MacKinnon. Neither knew Ms. Soo, but both were impressed, and the next year, each remembered her when they were putting together readings for shows they were developing. So in late 2013, while performing in another production of \u201cGreat Comet\u201d (then in a Midtown tent), Ms. Soo spent a week around a table, working through the second act of the musical Mr. Kail was developing \u2014 \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 followed by a week in a reading of the musical Ms. MacKinnon was working on \u2014 \u201cAm\u00e9lie.\u201d"]

(To make that all work, when \u201cGreat Comet\u201d opened on Broadway, Ms. Soo was in the audience, not onstage, her part now played by Den\u00e9e Benton.) Originating a role is different from performing in a revival. Lines, songs, scenes and characters are added and cut. Actors have an opportunity to shape what their characters say and do, but also must be game to adapt on a daily basis. \u201cI get to be part of the magic,\u201d Ms. Soo said. \u201cI get to see a writer\u2019s process, which is really special, especially having gone to Juilliard where a lot of the things we were doing were by playwrights who were deceased, so to have a live playwright in the room is such a treat. There\u2019s no map for you to follow and take your journey. You are Lewis and Clark. You are the mapmaker.\u201d Ms. Soo, known to friends as Pippa, had been acting since childhood in suburban Chicago.

Nearly 10,000 ethnic Albanians died as well as many Serbs. Thousands more, mostly ethnic Albanians, remain missing.

You\u2019d occasionally encounter it in quasi-classic cocktails like the Algonquin (rye, dry vermouth) and the Mary Pickford (gin, maraschino liqueur, grenadine).

And in the hotel\u2019s George Washington Bar, the Sweep the Leg contains the Japanese spirit shochu, clarified pineapple-Thai-basil juice and lime. \u201cI think pineapple has grown in popularity as a cocktail ingredient due to the naturally occurring balance of acidity and sweetness in the fruit,\u201d said Ben Rojo, bar manager at the George Washington."]

Gathers Experts to Evaluate Global Preparedness for Fiscal Crisis - The New York Times LIMA, Peru \u2014  As financial leaders gather here this week to assess the health of the world economy, one of the central topics for discussion will be how ready markets are for a crisis in a large developing economy such as China, Turkey or Brazil. At the center of this debate will be the question of whether the International Monetary Fund still has the ability to act effectively if \u2014 as some experts fear \u2014 emerging markets begin to crumble under the weight of heavy debt. For the better part of five years, the I.M.F., which is sponsoring the weeklong meetings of financiers, government officials and central bankers from around the world, has been bogged down where it does not usually engage in rescue work \u2014 developed Europe, in particular Greece. Now, with concerns mounting that the currency devaluation in China will create a sustained flow of money out of emerging markets, the fund must make sure that it is still in a position to fulfill its core function: identifying risks in emerging economies and bailing them out when they run short of cash. Driving these global concerns is the fear that the dollar-based debt in large emerging market economies has risen to unsustainable levels."]
["business/dealbook", "Last week, the fund became the latest global watchdog to warn of the dangers of an emerging market debt bubble, highlighting in a report published in advance of this week\u2019s meetings that corporate debt levels had soared to $18 trillion from $4 trillion 10 years ago. Citing this debt overhang, the fund has again lowered its outlook for emerging market growth in 2015 to 4 percent \u2014 about half the rate at which developing countries were growing earlier this decade. Construction companies in Turkey, real estate developers in China, retail chains in Brazil and steel companies in Malaysia \u2014 along with many other fast-growing emerging market companies \u2014 have gorged on cheap dollar-based debt in recent years. And the fear is that the financiers of this borrowing binge \u2014 global banks, sovereign wealth funds and bond investors based in the United States \u2014 will pull their money out en masse, causing currencies to collapse and companies to fail, forcing the I.M.F. to step in. Analysts say the fund has the resources to rescue a few countries if the need arises. But if the flow out of emerging markets is so extreme that more than just a handful of countries fail, the fund will be hard-pressed to rescue them all. This is not a central forecast, of course. And the likelihood that the Federal Reserve may hold off on raising interest rates should take some of the pressure off emerging markets. But with Congress continuing to refuse plans to increase the I.M.F.\u2019s resources, the feeling among many experts is that the fund is overstretched."]

Mr. Jen views the coming emerging market debt debacle as the last of three debt bubbles that have been driven by investors pushing for too much yield in a rock-bottom interest rate environment. First, there was the mortgage crisis in the United States, then the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and now emerging markets. And in each case, he points out, it was global investors unloading their risky assets \u2014 be it mortgage-backed securities in the United States, Greek government bonds or the debt paper of the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras \u2014 that set off the rout. The I.M.F. has been highlighting these risks in recent months. Over the summer, for example, it published a wide-ranging study that assessed the ability of large economies to handle a situation in which anxious foreign investors headed for the exits by selling their bonds or not renewing credit lines."]

The emerging market debt buildup has been more than a decade in the making \u2014 the consequence of many years of extra-loose monetary policies by global central banks that resulted in a worldwide glut of dollars.

In Brazil, the mall operator General Shopping \u2014 which has revenue largely in reals \u2014 skipped a payment on one of its dollar-denominated bonds last month. And in China, the dollar debts of a spate of real estate developers were downgraded by credit rating agencies because of currency mismatches.

Scores of education technology start-ups, their pockets full from a rush of venture capital, are marketing new digital learning tools directly to teachers \u2014 many are even offering them free to get a foothold in schools. That has enabled educators nationwide to experiment with a host of novel \u201cadaptive learning\u201d products, like math and foreign language apps that record and analyze students\u2019 online activities to personalize their lessons.

Already, some districts have experienced data breaches with software they purchased from vendors; in a few cases, student records have been publicly posted on the Internet. And online security researchers have discovered weaknesses in a couple of dozen popular digital learning services. Some legal scholars contend that the practice of signing up teachers directly \u2014 rather than their school districts \u2014 skirts federal privacy laws. Administrators like Mr. Young say they want teachers to have free access to the best learning apps. Yet guarding against the potential pitfalls \u2014 data breaches, identity theft, unauthorized student profiling \u2014 is a herculean endeavor."]
["technology", "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge for big districts,\u201d Mr. Young said, \u201cand an even bigger challenge for smaller districts.\u201d These concerns are likely to widen as education technology proliferates. Last year, the market for educational software aimed at prekindergarten through 12th-grade students amounted to nearly $8.4 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2010, according to the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. Yet, for now at least, each school district, of which there are more than 14,000 in the United States, is confronting these challenges and devising solutions on its own. In the Fairfax County, Va., school district, technology experts have conducted their own security reviews of several hundred digital learning products, and failed a few of the most popular ones. In Houston, one of the largest districts in the country, administrators are testing their own rating system for digital learning products and developing a set of district-approved apps for teachers. And in Raytown, Mo., Melissa Tebbenkamp, the school district\u2019s director of instructional technology, vets every app that teachers want to try before allowing it to be used with students. Among other things, she checks to make sure those services do not exploit students\u2019 email addresses to push products on them or share students\u2019 details with third parties. \u201cWe have a problem with sites targeting our teachers and not being responsible with our data,\u201d Ms. Tebbenkamp said.

By enticing teachers to adopt nascent technologies on their own, they say, companies can bypass established district procedures for reviewing the effectiveness and data security of educational software.

One federal law, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, requires school districts to maintain the confidentiality of student records and to keep control of those records even if administrators outsource certain school functions to vendors. Another federal law, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, allows schools to act in place of parents in allowing online providers to collect personal details from children.

["sports/othersports", "900 Feet Up With Nowhere to Go but Down - The New York Times MOAB, Utah \u2014 He had learned this extreme form of tightrope walking from a homeless man who wrote books on quantum physics. But that was years ago, while goofing around on a flexible piece of nylon webbing tied close to the ground between a tree and the bumper of a Chevy van. This was something else entirely for Dean Potter, one of the world\u2019s best climbers, barefoot in the dying sun last Friday, walking between ledges of a U-shaped rim above Hell Roaring Canyon, a 400-foot sheer sandstone wall on his right, a 900-foot drop to a dry riverbed on his left. No leash tethered him to the rope. Nothing attached him to earth but the grip of his size-14 feet and the confident belief that, if needed, his parachute would open quickly and cleanly and not slam him into the canyon wall. At 6 feet 5 inches and 180 pounds, wirily strong, Potter dressed in jeans and blue T-shirt emblazoned with a hawk. He wore a wide headband over unruly hair, gaining the appearance of a less gaunt and reckless Keith Richards as Alpine daredevil. As Potter stepped onto the 180-foot rope \u2014 a strand of iridescent blue against desiccated canyon shades of brick and tan and coppery green \u2014 he was believed to be the first person to combine the adventure sports of highlining and BASE-jumping."]
["sports/othersports", "He was also taking another stride toward his longing for avian flight, not as a birdman in a nylon wing suit or squirrel suit, which he had tried, but as a soloist who could jump off a cliff in a way that he did not yet understand, with a strength and concentration that he did not yet possess, and simply fly. Trance music pulsed from speakers on the canyon ledge with knowing lyrics: \u201cSometimes I think my dreams are wild.\u201d Highlining was a high-wire version of slacklining, an extreme cousin of tightrope walking in which no pole was used for balance and the rope was elastic, allowing for various tricks involving walking, sitting, lying down, flipping, even spinning hula hoops. BASE-jumping was an acronym used to describe parachuting from objects like buildings, towers, bridges and cliffs. At 35, Potter had long stirred wonder as a climber. Six years ago, in Yosemite National Park, he became the first person to free climb El Capitan and Half Dome together in less than 24 hours, meaning he used ropes only for protection in case he fell, climbing only with his hands and feet for a vertical mile. It was an effort requiring remarkable concentration and speed that would be unthinkable for an average weekend climber, who would need gear and most or all of a two-week vacation to make a similar ascent."]
["sports/othersports", "In 2001, Potter climbed the famous Nose route on El Capitan, a 3,000-foot vertical wall with a fierce overhang, in 3 hours 24 minutes. It was a feat stunning in its economy, considering that, in 1958, the renowned climber Warren J. Harding led the first team up the route in 45 days. Often, Potter has climbed thousands of feet carrying no ropes at all, nothing to aid his grip but shoes and a bag of chalk. \u201cSport is all about being in the zone, when time and space stop and everything goes away,\u201d said Beaver Theodosakis, the founder and president of prAna, the climbing apparel company that sponsors Potter. \u201cDean holds that zone for hours on end, when the mind can\u2019t wander, when you can\u2019t second-guess, when you have to be so confident and deliberate in your moves. Imagine in everyday life, if we could go to the office like that and not be distracted.\u201d If he was awe-inspiring, Potter was also a polarizing figure in the climbing world. In 2006, he climbed Delicate Arch, the revered 60-foot sandstone structure located near here that is featured on Utah license plates. Technically, it was not an illegal ascent, but Potter came under ferocious criticism, accused by others of slicing grooves in the structure (which he denies) and of betraying the soulfulness of climbing with self-promoting news media attention. \u201cDo what you want, but don\u2019t make it a spectacle,\u201d Cory Richards, a Moab photographer and climber, said."]
["sports/othersports", "In the uproar, Potter lost his sponsorship with Patagonia, the environmentally sensitive clothing and apparel company. Still, he said he had no regrets about climbing Delicate Arch. \u201cI know we totally respected that place,\u201d he said. He continues to climb with ambition. At the same time, rock climbing has become so mainstream that gyms invite children to scale indoor walls at birthday parties. In the way  surfers branched into skateboarding in the late 1950s, Potter was now pushing the envelope in the emerging sports of highlining and BASE-jumping. \u201cI think that partly has been a motivator for Dean, to keep pushing into the unknown and getting a little more fringe as things are getting more homogenized,\u201d Steph Davis, a top climber and Potter\u2019s wife, said. Potter, an Army brat who grew up in New Hampshire, began slacklining in 1993 under the tutelage of a Yosemite character named Chongo, famous among climbers for his itinerant lifestyle and his obsessive musings on theoretical physics. On his Web site, chongonation.com, Chongo warned that even for rock-climbing experts and extreme sport professionals, a misstep while highlining could result in serious Newtonian consequences of action and equal and opposite reaction. Last Thursday at Hell Roaring Canyon, Potter believed he was finally ready to walk the 180-foot rope while tethered to a leash around his waist. During a couple weeks of rehearsal, he had felt exposed on the rope, with a touch of vertigo. A parabola of sandstone curved off to his right, never more than 60 feet away. To his left, the gorge yawned a half-mile wide. Straight ahead, the rope was anchored to a narrow promontory that seemed to hover, drawing his vision a mile down the canyon."]
["sports/othersports", "\u201cWhen I get in the middle, an emptiness takes over,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI felt a little helpless.\u201d On his first few attempts at sunset, the temperature dipping into the 30s, Potter straddled the rope as he fell, barrel-rolling into a sitting position and scooting back to the ledge. And then with impeccable balance and concentration, his arms waving in smooth, swooping motions, he reached midway and beyond. The rope was more taut than a regular slackline. Still, it gave about two feet in the middle and moved a foot from side to side. Potter kept his equilibrium. The leash\u2019s metal ring dragged behind him, giving a reassuring scrape along the rope that was amplified by the canyon\u2019s acoustics. He secured the rope between his two biggest toes, focusing on a yellow flag hanging from the outcropping at the end of the line. He grew more confident and his breathing became shallow and loud and when he covered the distance Potter let out a whoop. It was at times like this, full of calm and terror, Potter said, that he felt most connected to himself and his surroundings. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a death consequence, when you are doing things that if you mess up you die, I like the way it causes my senses to peak,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI can see more clearly. You can think much faster. You hear at a different level. Your foot contact on the line is accentuated. Your sense of balance is heightened. I don\u2019t seem to feel that very often meditating.\u201d"]
["sports/othersports", "From the time he was a boy, Potter said, he had a recurring dream. He was in the air and people were giving him instructions in high-pitched squeaks, teaching him how to fly. At the end of his dream, he began to fall, dropping toward a dead tree, and then he awakened. As a climber, he came to believe that he might be seeing his own death. But as a highliner and BASE-jumper, he said, he had come to view his dream as an affirmation of flight instead of a portent of mortality. Potter\u2019s whole career has been moving toward a moment of detachment, said a friend, Brad Lynch, a filmmaker who has spent two years on a film about him called \u201cThe Aerialist.\u201d First, Potter climbed with ropes, then only with his fingers. Now he held on by the clutching of his feet. \u201cHow little can you be attached to the earth by?\u201d Lynch said. \u201cHow thin you can you make the veil?\u201d Last Friday morning at Hell Roaring Canyon, the sky was cloudless. The wind calmed as temperatures rose into the 50s. The leash was gone. Now Potter would rely on a parachute for safe passage to the ground. If he slipped off the highline, he would have four or five seconds to open the chute before he hit the broken rock below. It was imperative that he jump away from the sandstone wall so that he could float safely to a sandy wash on the canyon floor. The landing zone was marked with a circle on the river bed. A yellow flag signaled the wind direction."]
["sports/othersports", "As Potter stepped onto the line, he seemed not yet comfortable with the 12 pounds of extra weight from the parachute. When he fell and straddled the rope, it became more difficult to roll back into a sitting position. His movements, fluid without the chute, were jerky now, less certain. After a few tries, he said he needed a break then changed his mind. He walked 15 feet or so along the line, lost his steadiness, stuck his left leg out as a counterbalance, windmilled his left arm, then bounded on both feet off the rope, dropping into the canyon. He chute opened with a popping sound and he wafted toward the river bed, overshooting the landing zone in his bare feet, cutting his foot slightly on a rock. \u201cIt\u2019s still intimidating\u201d without a leash, Potter said after climbing back to the canyon rim. \u201cThere was no noise from that steel ring holding me onto the earth.\u201d Still, he clearly relished the liberation of his brief free fall from the line. \u201cI flew a little, oooh, yeah, pretty nice,\u201d Potter said. At sunset, he gave it another try, but his second parachute was a pound or two heavier. Potter seemed tired and wobbly, sticking his left leg out for balance, then his right. Again he hopped off the rope, gliding toward the river bed, landing this time like a leaf on water. In a week, he thought he would be able to walk the entire line. Already, he felt one step closer to flying."]

["us", "Considering Earthquake Threats in California and Oklahoma - The New York Times Oklahoma and neighboring states have been grappling with an increase in earthquakes tied to the boom in oil and gas production over the past 15 years. Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief for The New York Times, and Michael Wines, who has covered this subject,  discussed Monday\u2019s report that because of these man-made quakes, Oklahoma is as much at risk for a damaging quake as California. Here is an excerpt from their conversation: MICHAEL WINES: Kansans and Oklahomans like to say they are cool in the face of nature\u2019s wrath \u2014 twisters put quakes to shame, some have bragged to me \u2014 but the truth is that the last few years of shaking there has a lot of people rattled, so to speak. Now the United States Geological Survey comes out with a map that quantifies the chances of a damaging quake in the next year, and for parts of northern and central Oklahoma and southern Kansas, it\u2019s somewhere between one in about eight and one in 10 \u2014 about the same as your state. And just a few hours ago, there were two fairly big ones \u2014 magnitudes 3.6 and 4.2 \u2014 just north of Oklahoma City, which had been fairly quiet in recent months. Any advice for them?"]
["us", "ADAM NAGOURNEY: I\u2019ll try to resist the \u201cour catastrophic threat is worse than yours\u201d instinct but, well, I\u2019m afraid it probably is. The most discomforting things about earthquakes, I\u2019ve found, is that there is no warning; I\u2019ve never heard of anything called an earthquake siren. You\u2019ll find no end to people talking about earthquake weather, or how dogs will begin howling a few seconds before a big one strikes, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. The threat of earthquakes is just part of living in California. I suppose you could move someplace else, but there are things one can do to at least prepare for them. WINES: You\u2019re right about the threat: In Oklahoma, the Big One probably would be to the San Francisco quake what my two Aussies are to a snarling Doberman pinscher. One of the biggest quakes in state history, in 2011, totaled a dozen or so houses and damaged a lot more, but nobody died. The forecast that federal scientists issued on Monday is not as scary as it seems at first glance. Mostly, they are saying that the region is likely going to suffer more of the plaster-fracturing, driveway-cracking quakes that have been a costly nuisance for some time. But they don\u2019t rule out something more serious, and a lot of scientists I\u2019ve talked to say the potential for a shock more damaging than past ones is not insignificant. The Plains-state geology transmits shaking better than California dirt. And most important, maybe, Oklahoma buildings haven\u2019t been quake-proofed like yours."]
["us", "NAGOURNEY: I wish I could say that about buildings being quake-proofed here. One thing I\u2019ve noticed: Earthquake protection talk becomes front-burner in the first few weeks after a noticeable temblor, but it\u2019s not long before people just forget. But finally San Francisco, Los Angeles and Santa Monica, to name the main players, have all enacted measures requiring the retrofitting \u2014 that\u2019s the term of art, and if people living in Oklahoma or Kansas don\u2019t know it now, they will soon enough \u2014 of buildings. Here in California, that includes what are known as soft-story buildings, such as small apartment buildings held up by a few pillars to make room for a garage on the first floor that have proved to be very vulnerable to collapse, as we saw in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Also at risk are older concrete buildings; later ones were required to include steel reinforcing bars that provide added protection against collapse. The Los Angeles Times did an investigation a few years back that suggested that as many as 1,000 buildings might be in danger of tumbling in a big earthquake. Admirable journalism, to be sure, but not very comforting to those of us working on the ninth floor of an office building on Wilshire Boulevard. WINES: The most unnerving thing about Oklahoma, as we\u2019ve written, is that one fault sits more or less directly beneath one of the world\u2019s largest oil-storage facilities, a tank farm of gargantuan proportions. And it certainly hasn\u2019t been retrofitted. Beat that, California."]
["us", "NAGOURNEY: There are always fears about an earthquake at a nuclear facility, but I think what people are really afraid of \u2014 and what Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made earthquake preparation a central part of his legacy, has warned about \u2014 is a catastrophic earthquake that essentially shuts down his city by cutting off water and power for as much as six months. His worry, and the concern of other earthquake experts \u2014 there is a cottage industry of them here \u2014 is that could lead to people giving up on Los Angeles and moving to firmer ground. It could also lead to catastrophic fires that could go unchecked because fire authorities don\u2019t have water to put them out. The worst-case scenario, which people insist will happen someday, is pretty alarming. That said, you might want to ask, why do people keep living here, and how do they deal with it? WINES: I was in your state writing about water not long ago, and the big worry indeed was that a quake would wreck the aqueduct network that carries water from rainy Northern California to the south. The big worry in Oklahoma is about another liquid: oil. Scientists say you can\u2019t stop the quakes without cutting back drastically on the amount of wastewater pumped back into the ground, but the oil and gas industry can\u2019t pump up the good stuff without bringing a torrent of wastewater with it, and if there\u2019s no place to put it, pumping has to stop, or at least be dialed way back."]
["us", "The prospect that Oklahoma\u2019s cash cow might have to run dry to stop the tremors all but paralyzed state officials for years. You had the odd spectacle of hopping-mad citizens demanding action even as the governor ruminated that, well, maybe something else is making the state shake. Kansas, meanwhile, deemed quakes an imminent threat to the public and ordered steep cutbacks in waste disposal a year ago. NAGOURNEY: Well, for what it\u2019s worth, let me tell our Oklahoma and Kansas readers what it\u2019s like to live in a part of the land that is subject to the Big One. First, on the serious side, there is an ongoing effort to make sure everyone is prepared with an earthquake kit. I\u2019m guessing people who live in tornado country know the drill, but I have, in the back of my car, enough water to last a week, batteries, flashlights, a transistor radio (remember those?), a satellite phone, some cans of food, crackers, a blanket, a first aid kit. There are also annual shake-out drills, where people practice what they do during an earthquake. (Please, do not stand under any door frames or go running outside: That is so 1960s. \u201cDrop, cover and hold on\u201d is the mantra). WINES: That\u2019s exactly what federal officials are telling Oklahomans and Kansans to do: Prepare for a big quake, even if it might never come. And people may be doing that, but I haven\u2019t seen much anecdotal evidence of it yet. What about Californians? Do they see earthquakes as an imminent threat, or are they just the Golden State\u2019s version of the Plains states\u2019 tornadoes, a nasty but unavoidable routine in life?"]
["us", "NAGOURNEY: To me, as a reporter covering California, the most intriguing part of this is the psychological aspect, how people come to terms with living in a place where, if experts are to be believed \u2014 and I do believe them \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time till there is a huge earthquake. It says a lot about the human condition, I think (and also a lot about what a cool place California is to live). Of course, some people don\u2019t want to deal with it; there was a bit of an exodus after the 1994 earthquakes. Others are practical, making sure they are prepared and realizing that the odds are against them dying in an earthquake. That said, perhaps not surprisingly, the two most common defense reactions I\u2019ve found are denial and humor. Whenever there is a minor earthquake, the \u201cdid you feel that?\u201d tweets and blog headlines are everywhere. By the way, earthquakes are a regular topic at dinner party conversations \u2014 brought up alike by relative newbies like me and by people who have spent their life here. And consider this: The Los Angeles City Council has declared today Lucy Jones Day. Never heard of Lucy Jones? Well, around these parts, she is nothing short of a celebrity, known as the \u201cEarthquake Lady.\u201d For nearly a quarter-century, she has been the go-to person for everyone, including most recently Mr. Garcetti, looking for information on the latest earthquake.

Called \u201cLes Cahiers Dessin\u00e9s,\u201d or Drawing Notebooks, the exhibition, which comprises about 600 works and runs until Aug. 14,  sweeps through the multiple worlds of people, famous and obscure, who expressed themselves with whatever means they had on hand \u2014 pen, pencil, ink, paint, and even a mix of soot and saliva, in the case of the American artist James Castle,  born deaf and maybe autistic, who drew haunting scenes from his Idaho childhood. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pajak,  a publisher and the curator of the exhibit, said he believed that everyone knows how to draw, or at least they did as children before they turned to other forms of communication.

Although cartoonists from the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo (and its predecessor Hara-Kiri)  are represented, Mr. Pajak avoided the \u201copportunism\u201d of a last-minute addition of works by those murdered in the Jan. 7 terror attack that made the newspaper famous worldwide. Other cartoonists include Semp\u00e9, a French institution with his Thurber-like characters and empty urban landscapes; Sin\u00e9, with his raunchy women; the Swiss artist Noyau with his gentle mockery of museumgoers; and El Roto, famous for his daily cartoons in El Pa\u00eds, the Spanish newspaper. But it is in the darkness of the ground-floor gallery where visitors can explore the methods and the vision of such well-known artists as Hugo, Steinberg and Ms. Smith, as well as the Belgian painter Pierre Alechinsky,  who wrote with his right hand and drew semi-abstract figures with his left; the Polish-Jewish writer and artist Bruno Schulz,  murdered by the Nazis in 1942, whose tortured dreams provided him with scenes of idolatry and fetishism; and the French artist Roland Topor,  who let his imagination loose on the human body."]

There are examples of the fantastical hybrid creatures that inhabited the world of Unica Z\u00fcrn, who was born in Germany and moved to Paris in the 1950s and mingled with Surrealist artists between bouts at a psychiatric hospital before committing suicide in 1970.

The bill would also eliminate tax breaks for private employers who provide health coverage if their health care plans offer abortion services, and forbid women who use a flexible spending plan to use pretax dollars for abortions. Later in the week, House members are set to vote on legislation that would try to force the Obama administration to open up more coastal waters to offshore oil and gas production and expedite the permitting process. Senate Democrats intend to counter with proposals for eliminating tax breaks for major oil companies."]

When my first novel, \u201cThe People in the Trees,\u201d came out in 2013, I bought just one thing with my advance: a deep-blue enamel ring that I had lettered with the first line \u2014 Kaulana na pua a o Hawaii/Famous are the flowers of Hawaii \u2014 of one of the most resonant Hawaiian protest songs, \u201cFamous Are the Flowers,\u201d written in 1893 to voice support for the overthrown Queen Liliuokalani, the islands\u2019 last monarch. My book was an allegory of Pacific colonialism, and it seemed right that I should wear this reminder of Hawaii, what it had been and what it had lost, on my hand. When my second novel, \u201cA Little Life,\u201d was published last March, I didn\u2019t buy any jewelry. But people gave it to me anyway: a reader sent me a silver cuff. A group of my close friends got together and bought me a ring \u2014 a heavy gold bird with round, brilliant-cut diamonds for eyes and dangling a briolette-shaped ruby from its mouth like a drop of blood \u2014 from the renowned Jaipur-based jeweler Gem Palace. (This very creation had actually inspired a similar piece of jewelry that appears in the book\u2019s final chapter.)"]
["t-magazine/fashion", "But even so, I wanted a piece of custom jewelry, something to commemorate the novel\u2019s characters, who had become as vivid and complicated to me as my own friends: certainly it felt as if I had spent more time with them in the year and a half it had taken to write the book than I had spent with actual humans. And then my friend Claudia, a jewelry editor, told me about a label called Foundrae. Foundrae was begun and is designed by Beth Bugdaycay, the former CEO of Rebecca Taylor, and consists of women\u2019s ready-to-wear \u2014 silky, slouchy jumpsuits; micro-pleated, shell-pink chiffon skirts; knitwear stippled with holes and slashes \u2014 and a fine jewelry line. Co-designed with Leeora Catalan, the jewelry designs include triangle-shaped earcuffs and medallion-shaped charms, but the most distinctive pieces are enamelwork on 18k gold. Pleasingly hefty, they come in four colorways meant to represent a different quality or endowment one needs to find one\u2019s way through life: Strength (red), Karma (blue), Dream (black) and Protection (green). The label\u2019s own pieces are gorgeous \u2014 they have a graphic, talismanic quality that makes them appear at once assuringly ancient and attractively modern \u2014 but Bugdaycay and Catalan also do custom work, and really, jewelry is at its best when it\u2019s made for only you. When we wear a piece of custom jewelry, we are adding ourselves to a legacy as old as the Romans, the Greeks, the Persians \u2014 older. Very few traditions can be said to have remained unchanged over the history of time, but the act of announcing oneself to the world through jewelry is something that has endured through millennia and across cultures. We may no longer formally declare our tribal affiliations under flags or with particular hairstyles or colors, but we still do with what we choose to display on our fingers, our ears and around our necks and wrists."]
["t-magazine/fashion", "Bugdaycay and Catalan talk a lot about the ineffable qualities of their jewelry, and I was at first skeptical, even though they are both so radiant and kind that feeling any doubt seemed churlish, somehow. But then I went to visit them. Foundrae\u2019s New York City offices and showroom are on Lispenard Street, an obscure, narrow corridor south of Canal Street, just on the edge of TriBeCa, that happens to be the place my characters live: I had never before met anyone who knew of the street\u2019s existence, much less anyone who actually lived on it. It seemed like an omen. I went up to Bugdaycay\u2019s apartment \u2014 she lives above the store, just as a 19th-century shopkeeper would have \u2014 and she and Catalan let me fit different bangles around my wrists, let me try to cram their beautiful rings onto my fingers, let me tangle up their fine gold necklaces. They waited as I made my decisions, and then waited again as I remade them. And then, two or so months after that, a visit: a copy of my book, its pages glued together into a solid brick, wrapped in red ribbon and hand-delivered to my office by Catalan (Bugdaycay was out of town). \u201cOpen it,\u201d she said, smiling, and I did. There, in a square coffin Bugdaycay had carved out of the book\u2019s innards, were two pendants, one with the names of the two central characters, another with \u201cLispenard\u201d; and a ring, with all four of the main characters\u2019 names, the space between them punctuated with tiny diamonds. I put everything on at once, of course: the gold felt warm against my skin; I could feel the weight of the ring on my finger.

["us/politics", "7 Takeaways From the Release of the Secret Memo - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans released a disputed memo on Friday that accused the F.B.I. and Justice Department of abusing their surveillance powers to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. Compiled by Republican congressional aides, the memo has set off a political firestorm. Its claims are incendiary, suggesting a broad conspiracy against President Trump. But the memo fell short of providing evidence that would cast doubt on the origins of the Russia investigation and possibly undermine the inquiry. Here are seven takeaways: The United States\u2019 intelligence agencies were unequivocal in their assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. They were also adamant that the overarching goal of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was to sow discord and foment political upheaval in the United States. The fight over the memo has only helped intensify the partisan brawl set off by the election interference, and for many in Washington, the big winner appeared to be Russia. As Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, put it, \u201cThe latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests \u2013 no party\u2019s, no president\u2019s, only Putin\u2019s.\u201d For much of the past year, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have sought to portray Mr. Page, a former campaign aide, as nothing more than a gadfly who had no real role in the campaign. His meetings with Russian officials in July 2016 have been dismissed as the actions of a bit player."]
["us/politics", "But Republicans who wrote the memo, in making the warrant for surveillance of Mr. Page the crux of their case against the F.B.I., suggest that he was far more than a bit player and that is why they believe the bureau recklessly cut corners to get it. Or maybe Mr. Page was genuinely a blip on the campaign\u2019s radar, and the warrant granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reflects genuine concerns that he was acting as the agent of a foreign power, which is what the F.B.I. and the Justice Department have said. The memo, if nothing else, is an excellent primer on all of the anti-Trump boogeymen (and women!) who have filled out Republican talking points for months. It has some of the most prominent names, such as Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled a dossier of unverified claims that purported to detail how Russia aided the Trump campaign, and Andrew G. McCabe, the recently retired deputy F.B.I. director who has borne the brunt of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter fury. A sprinkling of lesser-known figures are included, as well, such as Bruce Ohr, who was a top Justice Department official before being sidelined, and his wife, Nellie Ohr, who monitored Russian news media for Fusion GPS, the firm that paid Mr. Steele."]
["us/politics", "Throughout the memo is a veritable who\u2019s who of F.B.I. and Justice Department officials who have been portrayed as corrupt partisans in Republican circles: Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who is overseeing the Russia investigation; Sally Q. Yates, who briefly served as acting attorney general before being fired by Mr. Trump; and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the F.B.I. officials whose anti-Trump texts are being examined by the bureau\u2019s inspector general. And, of course, there is Hillary Clinton, whose campaign paid for the dossier. The memo described Mr. Steele as having been \u201csuspended\u201d and \u201cterminated\u201d by the F.B.I. as a source for \u201can unauthorized disclosure to the media.\u201d It is curious language given what we know about Mr. Steele\u2019s relationship with the F.B.I.: He voluntarily approached the bureau, he never had any kind of formal arrangement with it and he was never paid. As far as Mr. Steele was concerned, the F.B.I. had no claim to the information he was sharing, and he was free to do with it as he pleased. The past few weeks have been the F.B.I.\u2019s and the Justice Department\u2019s time in the barrel, to paraphrase Roger J. Stone Jr., a Trump ally and self-described Republican dirty tricks master. But the ruckus on the House Intelligence Committee has not gone unnoticed in the intelligence community, including at the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency."]
["us/politics", "Intelligence officials are expressing concerns that House Republicans, having succeeded in releasing the memo, could continue to selectively release sensitive intelligence when it suits their political needs \u2014 and that next time, it might be C.I.A. or National Security Agency intelligence that is compromised. When the House and Senate Intelligence Committees were created in the 1970s after Watergate, they came with an implicit understanding: Americans spies would share secrets with a select group of lawmakers and senior congressional staff, and in exchange that information would not be used for political gain. The release of the memo threatens the delicate arrangement. Senior intelligence officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing Congress, have said in recent days said that they will, of course, comply with all of the laws that govern their relationship with Congress. But sticking to the letter of the law can easily be used to gum up the works and slow down the process. FISA warrants are among the most closely guarded secrets of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. Even disclosing the existence of a FISA warrant, all of which are classified, is a federal crime. You would not know that if you had been spending time around Congress in recent weeks. Numerous lawmakers and staff members have been openly discussing details of the FISA warrant used to surveil Mr. Page with reporters and other people who do not have security clearances. Will there be an investigation of the leaks? That would be up to the F.B.I."]
["sports/baseball", "Looking Ahead, Yankees Fall Behind for Their Second Straight Loss  - The New York Times The Yankees rode the Amtrak Acela train down to Baltimore on Sunday evening, but to say they were rolling into town, for perhaps their biggest series of the year, would not be quite accurate. With a dispiriting loss to the Cleveland Indians, 4-1, on Sunday, the Yankees dropped their second straight game and barely avoided the ignominy of being shut out in consecutive games for the first time in 15 years. Only Jacoby Ellsbury\u2019s two-out home run in the ninth inning spared them. And with a three-game American League East showdown against the Orioles commencing Monday, the Yankees ended a homestand that began impressively \u2014 three victories in four games against Detroit \u2014 looking flat and ill prepared for what awaits them at Camden Yards. Despite the Orioles\u2019 loss Sunday, 8-3 to the St. Louis Cardinals, they have been one of the more well-balanced clubs in baseball, seventh in the American League in runs scored and fifth in team earned run average going into Sunday\u2019s game. Baltimore has won 12 of its past 17, and 24 of its past 35, to build a six-game advantage on the Yankees. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose any more ground,\u201d said Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, who returned from a left pinkie injury Sunday and went 1 for 4. \u201cIt\u2019s getting a little late for that. This is definitely a series we need to win.\u201d"]
["sports/baseball", "Baltimore was six and a half games behind Toronto in the division on June 6 and managed to transform that deficit into a surplus almost as wide, giving the Yankees some reason to hope that they can turn the tables, too.

The surprise in the Yankees\u2019 two feeble efforts closing out the Cleveland series lay in how successful they had been recently. Backed by stout pitching, they faced down the Tigers, and their high-powered starting rotation, and then clobbered the Indians, 10-6, on Friday night. But between their five-run sixth inning Friday and Ellsbury\u2019s blast Sunday, they were held scoreless for 19 innings, a season high, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The last time the Yankees were shut out in consecutive games, according to the team, was May 12-13, 1999, when the Angels did it at the old Yankee Stadium. The Yankees avoided that unfavorable distinction this time, but they still could not disrupt the Indians\u2019 pitching staff."]
["sports/baseball", "On the heels of Corey Kluber\u2019s fine start Saturday, Carlos Carrasco held the Yankees scoreless through his five innings, allowing two singles. The Yankees went into Sunday\u2019s game ranked 10th in the A.L. in runs scored (467) and barely added to that total. Yes, there is lower offensive production leaguewide, but the Yankees are in the bottom half in most offensive categories. \u201cWe got caught up seeing teams score 900 runs in the past,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening anymore. With the things that have gone on in the game, the improved defense and the improved bullpens and pitching today, you\u2019re just not seeing as many runs.\u201d But the offense was not the Yankees\u2019 only issue Sunday. Hiroki Kuroda, their starting pitcher, allowed three runs and five hits, walked four and lasted only four and two-thirds innings. He also hit a batter with a pitch and threw a wild pitch, both of those errant throws contributing to runs. In his past four starts, Kuroda, 7-8 over all, is 1-2 with a 4.81 E.R.A., raising concerns that he is headed toward another late-season fade or that he might be pitching through soreness, something he did not deny when asked specifically. \u201cEverywhere you look around, it\u2019s hard to find a player that is 100 percent physically,\u201d Kuroda said through an interpreter. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to be able to respond with whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d"]

With his 97th, and final, pitch Sunday, Kuroda walked Yan Gomes to force home Cleveland\u2019s third run. On another day, three runs might not have constituted an insurmountable gap. But for these Yankees, even a one-run deficit has proved a challenge. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really been great all year,\u201d Teixeira said, adding, \u201cWe need to try to do our best and scratch out runs where we can and pick it up a little bit.\u201d"]

The newspaper did not say where in Hong Kong Mr. Snowden has been hiding since he checked out of a hotel early Monday afternoon. The Guardian newspaper of Britain, with which Mr. Snowden has shared a series of documents, reported Wednesday morning that he had moved to a safe house, but did not provide details. Mr. Snowden\u2019s decision to stay in Hong Kong came as a person with knowledge of the Hong Kong government\u2019s work on the case said local government lawyers, working with United States government lawyers, had identified several dozen offenses with which Mr. Snowden could be charged under Hong Kong and American laws."]
["world/asia", "The United States and Hong Kong operate under a 1996 bilateral extradition agreement, and any attempt by the United States to extradite Mr. Snowden would have to cite offenses that violate the laws in both countries, are punishable by jail terms of a year or more and meet the terms of that agreement. The person familiar with Hong Kong government efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate legal and diplomatic aspects of the case, said one of the offenses involves the release of official secrets, which is illegal in Hong Kong and the United States. That offense is covered by a catch-all clause in the extradition agreement, the person said, although some lawyers disagree. Mr. Snowden could delay extradition proceedings by requesting political asylum in Hong Kong. But he would almost certainly be taken into custody and jailed as soon as he filed for asylum, because he would no longer qualify as a visitor to Hong Kong, the person said. Leung Chun-ying, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said Tuesday on an official visit to New York that his government would not discuss Mr. Snowden\u2019s case. \u201cWe have existing laws and policies; otherwise we can\u2019t comment on individual cases,\u201d he said, according to an official transcript released here. An ideological divide has opened in Hong Kong\u2019s legal profession over how long Mr. Snowden can manage to avoid extradition to the United States. Some human rights lawyers say he could resist for years, partly by filing for asylum, although they predict that he would eventually lose his case and be sent back."]

The United States military\u2019s treatment of Pfc. Bradley Manning, accused of responsibility for the WikiLeaks release of classified documents, has been compared to torture by activists and legal scholars here. But Private Manning has been held in military prisons and tried under the military code; Mr. Snowden, as a civilian, is subject to the civilian criminal system in the United States, which has not received similar criticism. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t stand a good chance of avoiding extradition,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, a Human Rights Watch researcher here. \u201cWhen all is said and done, the Hong Kong government does cooperate with the United States on these cases. The only thing that could stop it is for China to step in.\u201d Legal and diplomatic experts said it was highly unlikely that China, which has no formal extradition apparatus with the United States, would intervene. Former judges and prosecutors tend to agree that the court system here has almost always granted extradition requests from the United States. These litigators note that extradition cases are heard in Hong Kong by judges \u2014 not juries, whose members might be more easily swayed by Mr. Snowden\u2019s appeals to public opinion."]
["world/asia", "\u201cIf Uncle Sam wants you, Uncle Sam will get you,\u201d said Kevin Egan, a former prosecutor who has since worked as a defense lawyer on extradition cases. While Mr. Snowden could say that he was the subject of political persecution in the United States, \u201cthe judiciary here is notoriously unsympathetic\u201d to such claims, Mr. Egan added. Mr. Snowden is almost certainly under surveillance by the Hong Kong authorities, said Steve Vickers, who oversaw police criminal intelligence here before Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997. He now runs his own risk consulting firm. The police had enough time to figure out where Mr. Snowden was after he revealed his role in the leaks late Sunday and before he left his hotel Monday, Mr. Vickers said. He arrived in Hong Kong from Hawaii, where he had worked at an N.S.A. center. A big question is what will become of the intelligence files Mr. Snowden brought here, and whether China\u2019s intelligence agencies would benefit if they got a chance to copy the data. The Guardian has said that while in Hong Kong, Mr. Snowden transferred hundreds of files to its reporters that will be the basis for further articles. Less clear is whether Mr. Snowden copied any other files before leaving Hawaii, and whether any of them have the potential to compromise American security interests."]
["world/asia", "Lawyers for people charged in other intelligence-related cases in the United States have sometimes threatened to divulge further information in court as a way to seek a dismissal or a reduction of charges. But Mr. Snowden has insisted that he chose to leak only those documents that illustrate his concerns about invasions of privacy in the United States. Mr. Snowden has told The Guardian that he had electronic access to American intelligence operations all over the world. Some American officials have questioned how that would be possible for someone based in an N.S.A. office in Hawaii. A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong police said arrests of people wanted by overseas jurisdictions could be conducted only by local police forces. But she declined to comment on whether foreign law enforcement personnel would be allowed to accompany local officers as observers. While Hong Kong retains a high degree of autonomy under Chinese rule, its police officers now must consider China\u2019s national security interests. David Zweig, a China expert at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said Beijing was probably reluctant to play a visible role in Hong Kong regarding Mr. Snowden. Whatever intelligence he may have is unlikely to be valuable enough to justify jeopardizing any good will created during President Obama\u2019s meeting last week with President Xi Jinping, he said. Yet, the Chinese security apparatus may benefit from Mr. Snowden even without obtaining any intelligence from him. Li Siling, a social media expert at the China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong, said that Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures were likely to play into the hands of those in Beijing who favor a strong security apparatus."]

A Wal-Mart worker on Long Island died after being trampled by customers who broke through the doors early Friday. And fights and injuries occurred around the country at some other stores operated by Wal-Mart, the nation\u2019s leading discount chain,  which is one of the few retailers thriving in the current economy. Despite those outbreaks, many other retailers appeared to have fewer customers than usual the day after Thanksgiving, which is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Merchants call it Black Friday  because in the past, it was when many retailers went into the black, or turned profitable, for the year. But longtime analysts, industry consultants and customers at malls and stores across the country said this year there were more shoppers than shopping bags. Even many die-hard Black Friday shoppers \u2014 the ones who camp out on sidewalks overnight to be first through the doors \u2014 said they were cutting back. It was mainly only discount chains, which had been expected to hold up a bit better than other types of stores, that were bustling long before sunrise. People showed up for a small number of limited-time \u201cdoorbuster\u201d deals, like 32-inch flat-screen televisions for $388 and laptops for $499.

["business", "Lobbying Efforts Intensify After F.C.C. Tries 3rd Time on Net Neutrality - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 In the nine weeks since the Federal Communications Commission said it would try, for a third time, to write new rules to secure an open Internet, at least 69 companies, interest groups and trade associations \u2014 over one a day \u2014 have met with or otherwise lobbied commission officials on what the rules should specify. That effort does not count the more than 10,000 comments that individuals have submitted to the F.C.C. Now the flood of lobbying efforts is likely to increase after the disclosure Wednesday evening that the F.C.C. would soon release preliminary rules allowing for the creation of special, faster lanes for online content to flow to consumers \u2014 for content providers willing to pay for it. The F.C.C. had previously warned against those types of deals, saying they could unfairly discriminate against companies that could not or were not willing to pay. But after a federal appeals court struck down, for a second time, the commission\u2019s earlier regulations, the F.C.C. is trying again. Reaction was swift to the proposed new rules, as consumer groups accused the commission of betraying its promise to maintain net neutrality, or equal treatment for both providers to and users of the Internet. That prompted an immediate rebuttal from the F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, who said late Wednesday that speculation that the commission was \u201cgutting the open Internet rule\u201d was \u201cflat out wrong.\u201d"]
["business", "The jockeying continued on Thursday. Verizon, which brought the court challenge that prompted the last set of open Internet rules to be struck down in January, issued a statement warning against \u201cunnecessary and harmful\u201d new rules. Consumer advocates reiterated their opposition. Mr. Wheeler stepped up his defense of the commission\u2019s plans. \u201cThe proposal would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the Internet will not be permitted,\u201d he wrote in a post on the F.C.C.'s blog. The sparring will be closely watched by every company that depends, even peripherally, on the Internet \u2014 which is to say, just about every company. Businesses that use Internet connections to provide consumer services \u2014 obvious ones like Google and Netflix but also home alarm system providers, medical equipment companies and even makers of washers and dryers \u2014 will thrive or fail based on how much it costs them to maintain easy online contact with households and businesses. As such, the lobbying ahead of the release of the proposed new rules on May 15 is certain to be intense. As recently as Tuesday, officials from the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, which represents cable and broadband companies and is led by Michael K. Powell, a former F.C.C. chairman, met with commission staff members to discuss the pending proposals. For Internet service providers, video distributors, movie studios and even medical companies, lobbying efforts will center on what it means for a broadband provider to favor some content over another in a \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d way \u2014 the standard that the F.C.C. says will determine whether a practice is acceptable."]
["business", "The F.C.C. says its proposal will show that it is trying to accomplish most, if not all, of the same goals that it pursued in its 2010 Open Internet Order, which the appeals court struck down. \u201cThe court of appeals made it clear that the F.C.C. could stop harmful conduct if it were found to not be \u2018commercially reasonable,' \u201d Mr. Wheeler wrote in his post. The commission \u201cwill propose rules that establish a high bar for what is \u2018commercially reasonable,\u2019 \u201d he said. In addition, he wrote, the commission \u201cbelieves it has the authority under Supreme Court precedent to identify behavior that is flatly illegal.\u201d For years, many advocates of a free Internet have said that information should never have to pay a toll to ride on the web. But as traffic and competition has increased, much of it from big video providers like Netflix, the Internet has been becoming more congested and regulators have struggled to catch up with new digital realities. If the F.C.C. fails in this attempt to devise rules that withstand judicial scrutiny, it might have no choice but to try to reclassify broadband for stricter utilitylike regulation, which would likely result in another trip to court. With no more than vague guidance, many interested companies were reluctant to comment. But Verizon said in a statement that it was \u201cpublicly committed to ensuring that customers can access the Internet content they want, when they want and how they want.\u201d However, it added, \u201cGiven the tremendous innovation and investment taking place in broadband Internet markets, the F.C.C. should be very cautious about adopting proscriptive rules that could be unnecessary and harmful.\u201d"]
["business", "That position was also put forth by two Republican lawmakers, Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee.

The marketplace has thrived and will continue to serve customers and invest billions annually to meet Americans\u2019 broadband needs without these rules. Chairman Wheeler\u2019s approach to regulation seeks to freeze current market practices, which will cast a chill on technological breakthroughs and cause American consumers to lose out.\u201d But plenty of groups supporting a strict interpretation of net neutrality criticized the F.C.C.'s plans. Michael J. Copps, a former F.C.C. commissioner who is working with the nonprofit advocacy group Common Cause to keep net-neutrality safeguards in place, said big telecommunications and entertainment companies had spent millions to lobby for rules that would allow them to tilt the scales in their favor.

["sports/basketball", "Jason Collins, First Openly Gay N.B.A. Player, Signs With Nets and Appears in Game - The New York Times LOS ANGELES \u2014 Jason Collins, a 35-year-old center, signed a 10-day contract with the Nets on Sunday afternoon and played against the Lakers hours later, appearing in an N.B.A. uniform for the first time since last spring, when he announced that he was gay. The signing represents a significant step toward transforming North American professional sports into a more welcoming environment for gay athletes. Until Sunday night, no N.B.A. game had taken place with an openly gay player on the floor. The N.F.L., Major League Baseball and the N.H.L. \u2014 the continent\u2019s other three traditional major sports leagues \u2014 have never had a publicly gay participant. The very act of Collins\u2019s suiting up and stepping onto the court \u2014 he entered the game to warm applause in the second quarter \u2014 represented a milestone in the effort to change a sports culture that some feel has lagged far behind society at large in acceptance of gay people. Collins played 11 minutes in the Nets\u2019 108-102 victory, finishing with no points, two rebounds, a steal and five fouls. Collins said he had little time to process it all. He awoke Sunday morning to text messages from his agent and Nets Coach Jason Kidd alerting him to the move, and hours later he was signing his contract. A few hours after that, he was taking his physical and preparing to play his first game since April 17."]
["sports/basketball", "\u201cRight now, I\u2019m focused on trying to learn the plays, the game plan assignment,\u201d Collins, sitting at a lectern, said less than an hour before the game Sunday night. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to really think about history right now.\u201d The sense of history was inevitable, though. It seemed noteworthy that the first openly gay player in one of America\u2019s major sports leagues would play for a Brooklyn team. In 1947, Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers became the first black player in modern baseball. It felt significant, too, that the Nets\u2019 owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, is from Russia, where President Vladimir V. Putin has come under intense scrutiny for a law that bans gay \u201cpropaganda.\u201d \u201cToday Jason Collins tore open the last remaining closet in America,\u201d said Brian Ellner, a founding member of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit that raises awareness about homophobia in sports. \u201cThis is a piece of history, an important point on the continuum toward justice and a moment to celebrate.\u201d Many felt that such a moment was overdue. Last April, after spending the 2012-13 regular season with the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards, Collins announced in a Sports Illustrated article that he was gay. He was met with widespread support and earned a measure of celebrity \u2014 but not a new contract to play basketball. He was not invited to any team\u2019s training camp and spent the last several months working out at his home in Los Angeles, readying himself in case a team called."]
["sports/basketball", "Collins\u2019s arrival with the Nets began to take shape two weeks ago, when he worked out for them in Los Angeles over the All-Star break. The Nets, who need help with interior defense and rebounding, were also interested in Glen Davis, who was bought out of his contract last week by the Orlando Magic. With Davis appearing to be near an agreement with the Los Angeles Clippers, though, the Nets shifted their focus on Sunday to Collins. Collins, like any N.B.A. player, can sign two consecutive 10-day contracts before the Nets must sign him for the rest of the season or release him. \u201cThe decision to sign Jason was a basketball decision,\u201d General Manager Billy King said in a statement. Collins has never been a standout player as a pro \u2014 he has averaged 3.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 0.5 blocks in his career \u2014 but he has consistently earned plaudits for his professionalism and smarts on the court. As a Net, the 7-foot, 255-pound Collins will be valued for his ability to provide a disciplined application of the coaches\u2019 defensive scheme, to read opponents\u2019 movements and to communicate to teammates what he sees. Collins will be a familiar face to many in and around the organization. He spent his first six and a half seasons with the Nets, who reached the N.B.A. finals twice in that span. It was during that time, too, that he became good friends with Kidd, who is in his first season as the Nets\u2019 coach."]
["sports/basketball", "Collins, who has played for five other N.B.A. teams, played alongside Joe Johnson when the two were with the Atlanta Hawks, and spent part of last season with the Celtics, playing with Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.

My game has been pretty consistent, you know. I\u2018m a defensive player first, and that\u2019s what I pride myself on.\u201d Collins is re-entering an American sports landscape that has changed for gay athletes since he last played. Robbie Rogers, 26, came out publicly last February while simultaneously announcing that he would retire from professional soccer. But Rogers changed course in May, joining the Los Angeles Galaxy and going on to play 11 games last season. And this month, Michael Sam, 24, announced that he was gay shortly after completing a four-year college football career at Missouri. Football analysts expect Sam, a highly regarded defensive lineman, to be selected in May at the N.F.L. draft. Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, commended Collins. \u201cI know everyone in the N.B.A. family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment,\u201d he said in a statement. There was a poignancy to the night, even as Collins tried to play down its significance. He wore a No. 46 jersey because it was the only shirt the Nets had available, but he said he planned to wear No. 98 in his next game, as he did last year. Collins has previously said that 98 is a reference to the year Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, was murdered."]

In time, though, the Warriors\u2019 lead swelled to 12 points, then 21, then 27, rising like a departing jet without a moment of turbulence. The Knicks\u2019 body language seemed to worsen with each Golden State 3-pointer (and there were 14 of them). The Knicks snarled when Tyson Chandler was ejected in the fourth quarter. They sulked when time wound down in another runaway defeat. The story of the 126-103 loss was not unlike that of the blowout they suffered a night earlier, against the Miami Heat, except that this was a home game, in front of an increasingly restless and uneasy crowd that showered the Knicks with boos at halftime and after the game. \u201cFire Woodson\u201d chants circulated.

The Warriors poured in 38 points in the first quarter, shooting 56 percent, and they were just warming up. Their 126 points were 3 shy of the most the Knicks have allowed all season. The Knicks could have anticipated this, knowing how the Warriors\u2019 All-Star leader, Stephen Curry, revels in performing on the type of stage that a Friday night game at Madison Square Garden offers.

When Golden State finished the first half on a 13-4 run, pushing its lead to 73-52, the crowd at the Garden sent the Knicks into the locker room with a shower of boos. The second half was not much better. If there was ever a lull in Golden State\u2019s offensive attack, it was momentary. In the fourth quarter, Tyson Chandler flashed his frustration by shoving Golden State forward Marreese Speights as the two jogged up the court. The two players needed to be separated and were served with matching technical fouls. A few minutes later, Chandler, jawing at Speights again, earned his second technical and an automatic ejection. (He finished with 6 points and 12 rebounds). Chandler said his frustration led to the ejection. \u201cI figured we would be a little flat considering the travel schedule,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I thought we would be able to do some things to slow them down.\u201d With Chandler gone, Anthony quietly exited, too, calling it a night with four and a half minutes remaining and the Knicks trailing by 19. For a second night in a row, he watched the waning moments of a runaway loss from the bench."]

By now, more New Yorkers may be aware of Dante\u2019s spectacular Afro than any other factor in the entire campaign. So it definitely could be the family. It could also be because de Blasio is nearly six and a half feet tall. New Yorkers like to think big. It would probably not be because of his work as public advocate. The New York City public advocate does not really have any work to do. His job is mainly to call press conferences and denounce things. We have quite a few elective posts like that around here. But it could be the carriage horses. We will get to them in a minute."]
["opinion", "When the race began, the two big names were Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, and Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller. Thompson is low-key. So low that Chris Smith of New York magazine interviewed an enthusiastic woman at a Thompson rally who said that in 2009 she had voted \u201cfor the opposite of Bloomberg. The Democrat. Whoever that was.\u201d It was Thompson. Quinn, who would be both the first female mayor and the first openly gay mayor in city history, was the early favorite. But now the latest Quinnipiac poll has her struggling with Thompson for second place, while de Blasio is threatening to sew up the nomination in the first round by winning more than 40 percent of the vote. It is possible that Quinn is having a hard time because she\u2019s a woman. Really, unless you\u2019re Hillary Clinton, New York is tough. Also, she is the candidate most identified with Mayor Bloomberg. We feel as if Bloomberg has been running the city since the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. And don\u2019t discount the Central Park carriage horses. Animal rights advocates have long yearned to abolish the industry, and Quinn is the only major Democrat who disagrees. The horses are very well-protected by regulation \u2014 they have to have five weeks of out-of-town vacation a year. French workers do not have as good a holiday package as the Central Park carriage horses. However, they do have to walk through traffic, which makes many people uncomfortable."]
["opinion", "The horses became a huge issue early in the campaign, when there was an entire mayoral forum devoted to the subject of animal protection. In it, John Catsimatidis, one of the Republican candidates, described how his wife tried to save the family\u2019s aged cat with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Quinn did not attend the forum. Neither did Joe Lhota, the Republican front-runner, who made news the other day when he criticized transit officials for closing down two subway lines for more than an hour after two lost kittens wandered onto the tracks. (The other candidates said they would have shut down the lines to save the cats. Anthony Weiner claimed he would have thrown his body over the electrified rail. Anthony Weiner is still not going to be elected mayor.) But Quinn, who owns two rescue dogs, was identified by the carriage horse crusaders as Public Enemy No. 1. Meanwhile, de Blasio, who vowed to retire the horses \u201cfirst day I\u2019m mayor,\u201d became their hero. (De Blasio seems to be hedging on the timing issue, perhaps realizing that putting the carriage industry at the tiptop of your mayoral to-do list sounds a tad over the top. \u201cIt will not be my first act, but it\u2019ll be something I\u2019ll do right away,\u201d the candidate said in a radio interview this week.)"]

What we have here is a lesson in intensity of preference. The animal rights folks started early, and drew a bunch of wealthy donors, some of whom had long-running issues with Quinn that had no relation to four-legged friends. They ran tons of ads, organized phone banks and showed up with their protest signs, throwing the campaign off-stride. Then de Blasio popped up as the change candidate, running to everyone else\u2019s left. New Yorkers may look loopy or out of control to the outside world, but when it comes to running the city, we generally pick candidates who are, one way or another, going to rein things in. Maybe this year, New York liberals are ready to party. If so, it\u2019d be the first time, really, since John Lindsay. Who was 6-foot-4."]

It was two weeks ago in Milwaukee, and he was stepping into an emergency. The St. Louis Cardinals had just lost their best pitcher, Adam Wainwright, to an Achilles\u2019 injury that would end his season. \u201cIt was definitely bittersweet,\u201d Harris said the other day, by his locker at Busch Stadium. \u201cI\u2019d love to get in the game, but that was the last type of situation I want to come in after.\u201d Harris is old for a rookie, and uniquely qualified for handling stress. He is the first graduate of the United States Naval Academy to appear in the majors since Nemo Gaines in 1921. On Tuesday, Harris became the first to earn a victory. He got a game ball as a keepsake that night after working an inning against the Chicago Cubs, his sixth scoreless appearance to start his career. Asked how it compared to his achievements in the military, Harris was not quite sure how to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to compare, really,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing that this is the dream that I\u2019ve always wanted and the goal of this is to win, it means a lot.\u201d"]

John Abbamondi, then the Cardinals\u2019 assistant general manager, said the team believed Harris\u2019s talent \u201ceasily\u201d put him in the top five rounds. But his five-year military obligation would most likely come first, which made Harris a risky choice. Abbamondi, who served nine years as a United States Navy flight officer, helped Harris apply for programs that would have effectively put him on active reserve status while allowing him to pitch in the minors. The hope was that as a professional athlete, Harris would bring positive attention as a role model and representative of the Navy. With the United States at war, the requests were denied. \u201cMitch respected that,\u201d Abbamondi said. \u201cHe wanted to go serve his country alongside his classmates at the Naval Academy, and he did it with distinction.\u201d Harris, a lieutenant, visited 30 countries and spent more than 16 months at sea, including two trips to the Middle East. He always packed a glove, he said, and his father sent several bags of balls. But playing catch on a flight deck in the Persian Gulf was hardly ideal. \u201cI would go with a military travel team for a month and we would all play baseball,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut other than that, we\u2019d throw a football and stuff when we\u2019d pull in on deployment, but nothing like \u2018All right, I\u2019m going to throw a bullpen right here.\u2019\u00a0\u201d"]

General Manager John Mozeliak said the Cardinals planned all along to welcome Harris back, to honor their commitment to a player who was honoring his. But they did not know what to expect when Harris finally returned in 2013, after 4 years 8 months 8 days of service. The baseball atrophy, as Mozeliak called it, could be profound. \u201cThe early returns were not positive,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cWhen we got him, he was throwing 80 miles an hour. He was in good condition, but not baseball condition. So basically we just asked our player-development people to be patient.\u201d Harris made the Cardinals\u2019 short-season Class A team and was older than the manager. He pitched well, but he did not make a full-season affiliate out of camp last spring. The Cardinals gave Harris an extra month to try to make their high-Class A team; if he did not, Mozeliak said, it probably would have been time to move on. But Harris made it, then advanced to higher affiliates and held his own in the competitive Arizona Fall League. He started this season at Class AAA Memphis, and he impressed the Cardinals in a late-spring exhibition against the major leaguers."]

He complements it with a cutter and splitter and is establishing himself as more than an uplifting story. \u201cOne of his first days, we were doing the national anthem, and nobody in his immediate area would leave the field until he did, just out of respect for what he\u2019s done and how he\u2019s served our country,\u201d Manager Mike Matheny said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal what he\u2019s doing.

Maybe, he said, he would have several years of major league service by now. But if he did, he would not have had another kind of service. He will not wish away those years. \u201cLooking back at what I did gain from the four years in the academy and the five years after is something that a lot of guys my age will never be able to experience,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe traveling and the hands-on education that I got through the Navy and throughout the world \u2014 and the leadership aspect of it, too \u2014 that\u2019s something you can\u2019t go to a school and get.

The letter prompted her father to make a revelation of his own: he had been with men, having had his first affair when he was 14. From her mother she learned that his homosexual dalliances included an episode with one of her babysitters. Though the marriage had continued through such infidelities, it now seemed likely to dissolve, Ms. Bechdel, a popular alternative press cartoonist, implies in her best-selling graphic memoir, \u201cFun Home: A Family Tragicomic.\u201d Instead, four months after she delivered her announcement, her father was hit by a truck and killed as he crossed a road in front of a Pennsylvania farmhouse he was restoring. Bruce Bechdel had spent most of his children\u2019s formative years lost in the project of restoring another house \u2014 an 1880 Victorian in Beech Creek, Pa., where the five family members were dispersed over 4,000 square feet and 7 bedrooms \u2014 and his interest in the material surfaces of domestic life is the leitmotif through which his daughter tells her story.

["business/dealbook", "Former Barclays Executives Appear in Court Over Qatar Deal - The New York Times LONDON \u2014 A group of former Barclays executives appeared in a London court on Monday to answer charges that they conspired to misrepresent arrangements made with the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar in 2008, as the bank raised capital to help it weather the financial crisis. British prosecutors charged the lender and four former executives \u2014 including a former chief executive, John S. Varley \u2014 last month, the first criminal charges to be brought in Britain against a bank over its actions during the financial crisis. The men charged are among the most senior bank managers anywhere in the world to face trial in a financial crisis-era case. The investigation is among several that Barclays faces over its 2008 actions, when it raised $15 billion from Qatar and other investors with two capital infusions, in June 2008 and in October 2008. That allowed it to avoid a government bailout, unlike several British rivals. The five-year inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office of Britain has revolved around whether Barclays properly disclosed an agreement with Qatar in which it paid more than 300 million pounds, or $390 million at current exchange rates, for \u201cadvisory services\u201d as part of the fund-raising, and around a $3 billion loan facility that Barclays made available to the Qatari government in November 2008. Barclays, Mr. Varley and the other former executives \u2014 Roger A. Jenkins, Thomas L. Kalaris and Richard W. Boath \u2014 have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation related to the June 2008 capital raising."]
["business/dealbook", "The bank, along with Mr. Varley and Mr. Jenkins, both 61, has also been charged with providing unlawful financial assistance and an additional conspiracy count related to the October 2008 capital raising. Lawyers for Mr. Varley and Jenkins said that their clients intended to plead not guilty. Mr. Boath has previously denied wrongdoing, as has the bank. A lawyer for Mr. Kalaris declined to comment after Monday\u2019s hearing. The men were released on bail on Monday after a brief hearing in Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court. Mr. Kalaris, who is American but lives in London, and Mr. Jenkins, who lives in California, will be required to put up \u00a3500,000 in security as part of their bail. Mr. Jenkins was executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa at Barclays Capital at the time of the fund-raising, and he played a central role in helping to arrange it. Mr. Kalaris, also 61, was the chief executive of Barclays Wealth and Investment Management. Mr. Boath, 58, was the European head of Barclays\u2019 Financial Institutions Group. The inquiry is one of a number of regulatory issues that have plagued Barclays in recent years. The bank paid $450 million in penalties over accusations it helped manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and its American chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., subsequently resigned. In December, the United States Justice Department sued the bank, accusing it of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages. Barclays has said the claims are \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d and has vowed to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself."]

["world/asia", "Afghan Leader Confirms Cash Deliveries by C.I.A. - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 President Hamid Karzai acknowledged Monday that the Central Intelligence Agency has been dropping off bags of cash at his office for a decade, saying the money was used for \u201cvarious purposes\u201d and expressing gratitude to the United States for making the payments. Mr. Karzai described the sums delivered by the C.I.A. as a \u201csmall amount,\u201d though he offered few other details. But former and current advisers of the Afghan leader have said the C.I.A. cash deliveries have totaled tens of millions of dollars over the past decade and have been used to pay off warlords, lawmakers and others whose support the Afghan leader depends upon. The payments are not universally supported in the United States government. American diplomats and soldiers expressed dismay on Monday about the C.I.A.\u2019s cash deliveries, which some said fueled corruption. They spoke privately because the C.I.A. effort is classified. Others were not so restrained. \u201cWe\u2019ve all suspected it,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and a critic of the war effort in Afghanistan. \u201cBut for President Karzai to admit it out loud brings us into a bizarro world.\u201d Mr. Karzai\u2019s comments, made at a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, where he is traveling, were not without precedent. When it emerged in 2010 that one of his top aides was taking bags of cash from Iran, Mr. Karzai readily confirmed those reports and expressed gratitude for the money. Iran cut off its payments last year after Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership deal with the United States over Iran\u2019s objections."]
["world/asia", "The C.I.A. money continues to flow, Mr. Karzai said Monday. \u201cYes, the office of national security has been receiving support from the United States for the past 10 years,\u201d he told reporters in response to a question. \u201cNot a big amount. A small amount, which has been used for various purposes.\u201d He said the money was paid monthly. Afghan officials who described the payments before Monday\u2019s comments from Mr. Karzai said the cash from the C.I.A. was basically used as a slush fund, similarly to the way the Iranian money was. Some went to pay supporters; some went to cover other expenses that officials would prefer to keep off the books, like secret diplomatic trips, officials have said. After Mr. Karzai\u2019s statement on Monday, the presidential palace in Kabul said in a statement that the C.I.A. cash \u201chas been used for different purposes, such as in operations, assisting wounded Afghan soldiers and paying rent.\u201d The statement continued, \u201cThe assistance has been very useful, and we are thankful to them for it.\u201d The C.I.A. payments open a window to an element of the war that has often gone unnoticed: the agency\u2019s use of cash to clandestinely buy the loyalty of Afghans. The agency paid powerful warlords to fight against the Taliban during the 2001 invasion. It then continued paying Afghans to keep battling the Taliban and help track down the remnants of Al Qaeda. Mr. Karzai\u2019s brother Ahmed Wali, who was assassinated in 2011, was among those paid by the agency, for instance."]
["world/asia", "But the cash deliveries to Mr. Karzai\u2019s office are of a different magnitude with a far wider impact, helping the palace finance the vast patronage networks that Mr. Karzai has used to build his power base. The payments appear to run directly counter to American efforts to clean up endemic corruption and encourage the Afghan government to be more responsive to the needs of its constituents. \u201cI thought we were trying to clean up waste, fraud and abuse in Afghanistan,\u201d said Mr. Chaffetz, whose House subcommittee has investigated corruption in the country. \u201cWe have no credibility on this issue when we\u2019re complicit ourselves. I\u2019m sure it was more than a few hundred dollars.\u201d In Afghanistan, reaction to reports of the payments ranged from conspiratorial to bemused. A former adviser to Mr. Karzai said the palace was rife with speculation that the details of the payments had been leaked to settle a bureaucratic or diplomatic score, either by Afghans or by American officials. Outside official circles, some Afghans offered a lighter take. \u201cThey make it sound as if it was a charity money dashed by a spy agency,\u201d wrote Sayed Salahuddin, an Afghan journalist, on Twitter, referring to the palace statement that money had been used to help wounded soldiers. \u201cThey must have \u2018treated\u2019 many people.\u201d"]
["technology", "Phone Hackers Dial and Redial to Steal Billions - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO \u2014  Bob Foreman\u2019s architecture firm ran up a $166,000 phone bill in a single weekend last March. But neither Mr. Foreman nor anyone else at his seven-person company was in the office at the time. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is crazy. It must be a mistake,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Foreman said. It wasn\u2019t. Hackers had broken into the phone network of the company, Foreman Seeley Fountain Architecture, and routed $166,000 worth of calls from the firm to premium-rate telephone numbers in Gambia, Somalia and the Maldives. It would have taken 34 years for the firm to run up those charges legitimately, based on its typical phone bill, according to a complaint it filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The firm, in Norcross, Ga., was the victim of an age-old fraud that has found new life now that most corporate phone lines run over the Internet. The swindle, which on the web is easier to pull off and more profitable, affects mostly small businesses and cost victims $4.73 billion globally last year. That is up nearly $1 billion from 2011, according to the Communications Fraud Control Association, an industry group financed by carriers and law-enforcement agencies to tackle communications fraud. Major carriers have sophisticated fraud systems in place to catch hackers before they run up false six-figure charges, and they can afford to credit customers for millions of fraudulent charges every year. But small businesses often use local carriers, which lack such antifraud systems. And some of those carriers are leaving customers to foot the bill."]
["technology", "The law is not much help, because no regulations require carriers to reimburse customers for fraud the way credit card companies must. Lawmakers have taken the issue up from time to time, but little progress has been made. Last year, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, pushed the Federal Communications Commission to adopt new regulations after dozens of small businesses around Albany were hit with the swindle. But the agency has not taken any action, and the cause appears to have petered out. Representatives for the agency and the senator\u2019s office did not return requests for comment. The scheme works this way, telecommunications fraud experts say: Hackers sign up to lease premium-rate phone numbers, often used for sexual-chat or psychic lines, from one of dozens of web-based services that charge dialers over $1 a minute and give the lessee a cut. In the United States, premium-rate numbers are easily identified by 1-900 prefixes, and callers are informed they will be charged higher rates. But elsewhere, like in Latvia and Estonia, they can be trickier to spot. The payout to the lessees can be as high as 24 cents for every minute spent on the phone. Hackers then break into a business\u2019s phone system and make calls through it to their premium number, typically over a weekend, when nobody is there to notice. With high-speed computers, they can make hundreds of calls simultaneously, forwarding as many as 220 minutes\u2019 worth of phone calls a minute to the pay line. The hacker gets a cut of the charges, typically delivered through a Western Union, MoneyGram or wire transfer."]
["technology", "In part because the plan is so profitable, premium rate number resellers are multiplying rapidly. There were 17 in 2009; last year there were 85, according to Yates Fraud Consulting, which is based in Britain. In 2012, hackers hijacked the phone lines at 26 small businesses around Albany and ran up phone bills as high as $200,000 per business over the course of a few days. Those businesses that contracted with major carriers received credit that covered much of the fraud, though some ended up paying a few thousand dollars. Those who had signed up with a local carrier, Tech Valley Communications, were not so lucky. Tech Valley sued three of its clients to pay huge bills, according to court filings. Best Cleaners, a dry cleaning chain that operates in three states, was one victim. At that business, hackers placed more than 75,000 minutes of premium calls, totaling $147,000. At American Energy Care, a small consulting firm in Albany, the bill reached $200,353. A billboard advertising business in Cohoes, N.Y., was charged $18,000. All settled their cases with Tech Valley. None would discuss the case because of the terms of the settlement, but Best Cleaners said the cost was enough to force it to cancel a planned expansion. Industry groups are trying to tackle the problem but say it is hard to keep up with. Roberta Aronoff, the executive director of the Communications Fraud Control Association, said she routinely loads fake \u201chot numbers\u201d into a fraud management system, sharing them with carriers so they can be blocked."]
["technology", "Catching the criminals is difficult because the crime can cross as many as three jurisdictions. In 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and police in the Philippines arrested four men who used the scheme to make $2 million in fraudulent calls; revenue was directed to a Saudi Arabian militant group that United States officials believe financed the 2008 Mumbai terrorist bombings. Foreman Seeley Fountain, the architecture firm, is disputing its $166,000 bill with its carrier, TW Telecom. The bill now includes $17,000 in late charges and termination fees. In addition to asking the F.C.C., the firm has asked the local police, officials at the Georgia Public Service Commission, the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice for help. The F.C.C. and Justice Department declined to comment for this article, and the Georgia agency did not return requests for comment. The local police said there had been no progress in finding the hackers. Joshua Campbell, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the bureau was working with the industry to solve the problems but declined to discuss the specific case.

["world/europe", "No Turkish President Had Gone to Greece in 65 Years. So Why Now? - The New York Times Recep Tayyip Erdogan became the first Turkish president to visit Greece in 65 years when he arrived on Thursday and met with the Greek prime minister and president. He immediately affronted his hosts by raising the prospect of changes to the treaty that defines their borders. On Friday, he repeated the same comments in Thrace, in northeastern Greece, home to the country\u2019s Muslim minority, which Turkey has long referred to as a Turkish minority. In a conciliatory gesture to his Greek hosts, Mr. Erdogan acknowledged for the first time the tiny Pomak minority as a Muslim community separate from those of Turkish origin. \u201cYou have been fighting for survival, and I congratulate you for this,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in an impromptu speech, adding that the region was \u201ca bridge between two neighbors.\u201d The last president of Turkey to visit Greece, Celal Bayar in 1952, promoted the stabilization of borders. Mr. Erdogan had twice visited Greece as a prime minister, but this was his first visit as a newly empowered president, and it came at a time of increasing diplomatic isolation for Turkey. So how did we get here? Mr. Erdogan\u2019s visit on Thursday is the first by a Turkish head of state since \u201cthe honeymoon period of Greek-Turkish relations that spanned from the 1930s to the early 1950s,\u201d Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute, said in a telephone interview."]
["world/europe", "However, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s position as president, which was consolidated in a referendum in April, is substantially different from that of his predecessors. Previous Turkish presidents were symbolically important, but they did not enjoy the executive powers that Mr. Erdogan now does. \u201cNo president before him had the power to drive foreign policy, none of them,\u201d Fadi Hakura, the manager of the Turkey project at Chatham House, a think tank based in London, said in a telephone interview. The significance of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s visit also lies in its timing: He reached out to a historically antagonistic neighbor at a moment when he finds himself and Turkey isolated abroad. Besides a high-profile trial in New York in which he is directly implicated, the past year has seen Turkey\u2019s relations with the West deteriorate because of tensions with the United States, the European Union, Germany and Austria, among others. \u201cMr. Erdogan needs a P.R. success story to break Turkey\u2019s diplomatic isolation. He needs a photo opportunity with a country that is a member of NATO and the European Union,\u201d Thanos Dokos, the director of Eliamep, an Athens-based think tank, said in a telephone interview. Other experts suggested that Mr. Erdogan was reaching out to the Balkan countries, after failing in a plan to render Turkey a significant player in the Middle East. \u201cHe is looking for greatness for Turkey. He wants to make Turkey great again, he wants to make it a star country, which is why he is now directing his attention to the Balkans,\u201d said Mr. Cagaptay, who recently wrote a book on Mr. Erdogan titled \u201cThe New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey.\u201d"]
["world/europe", "In the 65 years since Turkey\u2019s last president visited Greece, tensions have peaked several times. In September 1955, Turkish nationalists targeted the Greek minority in Istanbul, after news of a dynamite explosion near the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki, a city in northern Greece. \u201cTens of thousands of young Turks roamed through the city, smashing Greek store windows, wrecking store interiors and overturning automobiles,\u201d read a front-page article in The Times in 1955. Relations between Greece and Turkey dramatically deteriorated after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974, which came a few days after a Greek-Cypriot guerrilla group had overthrown Archbishop Makarios, the island\u2019s longtime leader. Turkish officials had feared a Cypriot union with Greece, whose military government at the time had backed the coup. About 160,000 Greek Cypriots were displaced in the crisis. In late January 1996, both Turkey and Greece claimed the sovereignty of a pair of uninhabited Aegean Islands, known as Imia in Greece and as Kardak in Turkey. Greek and Turkish ships surrounded the islands, a confrontation that calmed only after NATO intervened. An earthquake that devastated Turkey in the late summer of 1999 prompted a rapprochement between the two countries. \u201cBig earthquakes took place in both countries at the same time, humanitarian help was offered and the respective societies worked together,\u201d Mr. Hakura said. Turkish and Greek foreign ministers saw an opportunity for reconciliation, the so-called \u201cearthquake diplomacy.\u201d In the aftermath, there was a dramatic improvement in relations."]
["world/europe", "With Greece and Turkey still at odds on many important issues, \u201cit\u2019s a breath of fresh air in Greek-Turkish ties that they\u2019re currently reaching out to each other,\u201d said Mr. Cagaptay. These issues include migration, the Cyprus dispute, Turkey\u2019s stalled accession process for European Union membership \u2014 Greece supports moving the process on \u2014 and the airspace and Aegean disputes that have been plaguing their relationship for years. \u201cThe two countries could do so much if they worked closer together. There is untapped financial potential,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay suggested. Any progress is fragile, given the longstanding animosity between the two countries. That was amply demonstrated when Mr. Erdogan raised the prospect of an \u201cupdate\u201d of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which defined Turkey\u2019s borders with its neighbors. The notion did not go down well with his Greek hosts. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Greece has carefully thought about what an \u2018update\u2019 of the Lausanne treaty would mean for the country, as it does not consider this to be a matter for deliberation,\u201d Dimitrios Triantaphyllou, an associate professor of international relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, said in a telephone interview. But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s words were most likely intended for domestic consumption in Turkey, he said. \u201cHe is an international leader always talking to a national audience,\u201d Mr. Triantaphyllou said. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in demonstrating that Turkey is a key player for stabilization, that it should be respected and that it\u2019s in control.\u201d"]

Newhouse Theater. Where, oh where, will they summer next year, now that Fire Island has become perhaps a little too, er, hot for young children, with the awkward questions about what all those men are doing in the underbrush? How will they find a nanny \u2014 sorry, they prefer the delicate euphemism \u201ccaregiver\u201d \u2014 to replace the jewel they found this summer? And while the little ones have flourished in their fancy preschool, the challenge of getting into just the right kindergarten now looms. There\u2019s something off-puttingly insular about the world of privilege, both gay and straight, depicted in Mr. Parnell\u2019s comedy-drama about the new frontier of gay marriage and parenthood. The characters all seem to be living in a Design Within Reach catalog, among $7,000 sofas and $4,000 chandeliers. But if you grant Mr. Parnell his natural right to depict rarefied lives \u2014 this is Lincoln Center Theater, after all \u2014 his play does delve with intricacy and heart into the thorny lives of the proliferating number of gay couples with children today. \u201cAnd I thought it was women who were supposed to have it all,\u201d one of the play\u2019s female characters wryly remarks. \u201cTurns out it\u2019s you guys,\u201d she adds, meaning you gays. But she also adds, without malice, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what comes from that.\u201d"]
["theater", "As that remark suggests, we are learning that in the 21st century, having it all can be an elusive and ephemeral state, and perhaps not an entirely desirable one. At its best \u2014 when we are not being subjected to endless mommy-daddy or daddy-daddy talk about the more trivial problems of child-rearing \u2014 Mr. Parnell\u2019s play smartly explores the complex emotional and sexual dynamics of relationships, gay and straight, and how they can evolve (or devolve), once the responsibilities of raising children factors into the equation. The play focuses primarily on two gay couples living in New York. Rob (Patrick Breen), in his mid-40s, is a therapist married to Alan (John Benjamin Hickey), 50, a journalist who writes for publications like The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker, although he\u2019d like to jump off the deadline treadmill and start work on that memoir. They have a 3-year-old daughter, Nicola, and in the opening scene are meeting up with some new friends, the younger gay dads Scott (Stephen Plunkett), who works in private equity, and Jason (Alex Hurt), a painter. They have two boys, and the conversation naturally (and sometimes tediously) turns on matters of preschools, doctors and the like. (We never see any of the children.) Hints are dropped over dinner and developed in the next scene, a dinner at Rob and Alan\u2019s place with their straight married friends Michael (John Pankow) and Serena (Kellie Overbey), that Alan has been troubled by Nicola\u2019s more firm bonding with Rob. It is Rob she calls for when crankily refusing to go to bed, and when Alan attempts to calm her she grows only more obstreperous."]
["theater", "Michael gamely confesses to a similar worry when they first considered having a child. And when Rob succumbs to Nicola\u2019s demand to be read a scary bedtime story, and Serena joins him, Michael makes a more startling confession to Alan, almost equally casually: He\u2019s been having an affair with an actress, Julia, played with a gently sardonic touch by Tammy Blanchard. (In a running joke, Michael, Rob and Alan \u2014 who also know Julia through the kids \u2014 snark that they are sure her husband is a closeted gay man.) A scandalized Alan tells Michael that he should end it, but Alan is also working on an article about a supposed \u201cfidelity gene.\u201d As it proceeds, Mr. Parnell\u2019s play tends to offer implicit support for such a theory. Without giving too much away, I can say that the question of extramarital sex becomes an issue for all three of the play\u2019s couples. The production, directed smoothly by Scott Ellis, is trimmed in appropriately plush designs: John Lee Beatty\u2019s settings gleam with the sheen of upper-middle-class wealth, and the costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser give subtle defining touches to the characters. Mr. Parnell\u2019s literate dialogue fits snugly amid the stylishness. There are a few occasions when a Significant Topic trots a little too obviously into the room. But for the most part, the play\u2019s themes \u2014 how gay men\u2019s approaches to sex can radically differ; whether fractured relationships can ever be repaired; how the question of biological parenthood can become a thorny one for gay couples; and how children can alter the sexual and emotional dynamics between any couple \u2014 are handled with nuance and insight."]
["theater", "I almost get tired of writing these (or similar) words, but the cast is impeccable. The play does not require much in the way of acting pyrotechnics, but establishing the nuances of relationships without the benefit of such opportunities makes the performers\u2019 work all the more impressive. Mr. Hickey is especially touching as Alan, who recalls feeling marginalized (albeit, in retrospect, fortunate) during the 1980s, when most men of his generation were blithely having lots of happily anonymous sex. Now, with Nicola\u2019s arrival, different but similar feelings of being pushed to the margins gnaw at him.

["world/europe", "\u2018A Broader View\u2019 vs. \u2018An Invasion\u2019: Dutch Voters Speak Out on Immigration - The New York Times Dutch voters go to the polls next week after a loud and divisive campaign that focused on immigration, the first of a series of European elections this year that could propel populist forces into power. Geert Wilders, the virulently anti-immigrant leader of the Netherlands\u2019 Party of Freedom, or P.V.V., has led the charge on the immigration debate, drawing in parties on the mainstream right. Ahead of the vote, we asked Dutch readers to tell us how immigration has affected their lives and shaped their political beliefs. Over 2,300 people from across the Netherlands responded, reflecting a wide spectrum of backgrounds and political views. There were colorful examples of a welcoming society, expressions of frustration and fear, and passionate pleas for and against migration. Many others said they were frazzled and disillusioned by the political debate. Khalid Nabil, 28, is a translator who lives in the northern town of Heerhugowaard. He is a third-generation descendant of immigrants in the 1960s. My hope is that one day immigrants are as welcome as they were in the \u201960s, \u201970s when they were needed. And that the problems, which I am not ignoring, are not looked upon with an eye of fear and segregation, but with sincere interest in the cause of the issues. My concerns are that the once so tolerant Netherlands will turn into a frightened right-wing country that is beyond recognition. _____"]

I went to a multiethnic elementary school with children from all backgrounds, including Suriname, the Antilles, Turkey and Morocco. We all spoke Dutch, cheered for the national football team winning the European Championship in 1988, and at school we were allowed to share anything that made our culture special. We celebrated Easter and Christmas, but always with delicious treats from all over the world.

My home for this scorchingly hot week in June is a one-room cabin without electricity or running water that my host, the artist Andrea Zittel, has purposefully left nearly bare, and I\u2019m craving the flame\u2019s intricate shadow, the only baroque fillip in this spartan interior. As daylight drains from the wide, empty plain outside the uncurtained windows, and the darkness makes the uncanny quiet feel even more silent, I fall into a brief reverie about the human hunger for ornamentation and the expressionlessness of my electric lamps back home. Mundane revelations, perhaps, but insights into the ordinary are the point of living in this spare box tucked into a landscape as strange and sweltering as Venus, with little to occupy me but uninterrupted thoughts about how I conduct every bit of my life, down to the way I brush my teeth or wipe my hands on a dish towel."]
["t-magazine", "The 400-square-foot structure, where I have come to try to understand Zittel\u2019s work \u2014 and, if her theories are correct, myself as well \u2014 is one of a pair she calls \u201cExperimental Living Cabins.\u201d They are the latest addition to her singular oeuvre, called A-Z West \u2014 a challenging sprawl of projects that has developed in the 17 years since she left an art career in New York for a lone stucco shack on the edge of ghostly Joshua Tree National Park, some 130 miles east of L.A., where she currently lives full time. What she refers to as her \u201clife practice\u201d now comprises more than 60 acres, including permanent sculpture installations, informal classrooms, shipping container workspaces, dormlike guest quarters and a giant studio with rooms for weaving textiles and crafting rustic clay bowls. The bowls and textiles, collectively known as A-Z West Works, are sold to help keep the whole thing going. Maintaining this small empire has required endless endurance, extreme physical exertion and an obsessive ambition of the sort we associate with the celebrated, largely male land artists of the 1970s who colonized the American desert, among them Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson. But while those protean figures are experiencing a renaissance in the public imagination, their works have, in fact, ossified or become commercialized \u2014 in New Mexico, De Maria\u2019s \u201cThe Lightning Field\u201d (1977), consisting of 400 sharpened steel poles, is run by the Dia Art Foundation as a sleepover site; Heizer\u2019s \u201cCity,\u201d begun in 1972 as a mile-and-a-half-long excavation set to be one of the largest sculptures ever made, won\u2019t be visitable or photographable until at least 2020; \u201cSpiral Jetty,\u201d the mammoth pinwheel of mud, salt and rock that Smithson finished in 1970, has spent most of its existence underwater \u2014 whereas Zittel\u2019s experiment has, since she conceived it, moved from the theoretical to the vividly animated in a way that few utopian art projects ever do."]
["t-magazine", "Like her predecessors, Zittel\u2019s material is also the Southwestern desert, but she isn\u2019t a land artist in the traditional mode: Instead of moving earth with giant machines, or leaving hulking, unpeopled abstractions amid the dust, she employs this vast landscape to explore and challenge the quotidian functions of our existence. She was trained as a sculptor and still considers herself one, but her art is really a kind of philosophical quest, one that involves an ongoing and intense examination of what it means to live: What do we really mean when we say we need shelter, community, clothes, tools, light? How elaborate a space \u2014 indeed, how much space, down to the millimeter \u2014 do we need to survive, to thrive? What structures best facilitate creativity, serenity, unity? What makes Zittel\u2019s art seem so urgent at this moment is that the culture appears to have caught up to her at last: In our era of rapidly shifting domestic arrangements, nearly everyone \u2014 young people living alone or aging couples in communal compounds \u2014 seems badly served by architecture designed for the increasingly vestigial nuclear family. The cultish Marie Kondo\u2019s admonitions to cast out the nonessential seems ripped from Zittel\u2019s playbook; the conceptual underpinnings for the swelling phalanx of tiny, modular dwellings that evade byzantine zoning regulations and create a more mobile society can be found in Zittel\u2019s experiments as well."]
["t-magazine", "During her nearly two decades in the barren, windswept wasteland, her practice has gone from an isolated curiosity to a complete operational community constructed to outlive her, a \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d laboratory that reflects our contemporary fascination with the spaces in which we live. From ur-furniture that makes even the concept of a chair seem quaint, to vessels that force us to question the notion of a drinking glass, Zittel\u2019s work reminds us that the elemental building blocks of human society are ultimately domestic \u2014 and that revolution begins in private. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t want them to feel comfortable, either,\u201d Zittel tells me. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re alone with yourself and you feel jangly and on edge?

There were thin black onyx rings on all of her fingers; her bare arms were those of someone who regularly lifts heavy objects. Based on her minimalist, cerebral aesthetic, I\u2019d expected her to be austere and aloof. But as I watched her make the rounds of the property, conferring with assistants and checking on the artists bent over the kiln, she projected a regal serenity, asking questions and waiting patiently for the answer before responding in a cadence she once conceded has a bit of Valley Girl in it. The Brooklyn-based artist Rachel Harrison, who has known Zittel for 20 years, since they both lived in Williamsburg, calls her \u201clegendarily generous,\u201d especially to young artists, several hundred of whom have spent time at A-Z West over the years."]

In 2004 she started the \u201cWagon Station Encampment,\u201d 12 domed aluminum-clad units around a central outdoor kitchen that marry the proportions of a frontier-era covered wagon with the modernity of a Subaru Outback; there is just enough space for one person to sleep or sit up, and a few hooks for personal items. Over the years, during which dozens of artists have stayed in them for weeks at a time, she has assiduously maintained the wagons, two early versions of which are owned by the Guggenheim; from a distance, they gleam like fallen satellites in a lunar terrain. Several months ago, she opened her latest permanent site-specific work, \u201cPlanar Pavilions,\u201d a loose grid of 10 configurations of black-painted cinder-block walls of varying heights \u2014 some low enough to sit on, others as tall and imposing as linebackers \u2014 along a gentle slope, which calls to mind the crumbled foundations of a future civilization as well as the constellation of concrete boxes Donald Judd installed in the early 1980s on his own property in Marfa, Tex."]
["t-magazine", "I have driven west to see her from the \u201cExperimental Living Cabins,\u201d set on 15 acres a 40-minute drive away in Wonder Valley, a desolate, unincorporated corner of the Mojave Desert, near the joyless sprawl of Twentynine Palms, home to one of the largest military training areas in the country. Zittel started buying up acreage to add to her holdings several years ago, attracted by the site\u2019s remoteness and the several ramshackle \u201cjackrabbit homesteads\u201d on the property (really, little more than a dusty patch of desert), relics of the Small Tract Act of 1938, which lured pioneers to \u201cprove up\u201d five acres. (The terrain is so inhospitable that few actually stayed.) She now owns three of the cabins, though only two are renovated: simple board-and-batten structures, painted gray with white trim, that stand alone amid the scrub brush, 600 feet apart in the wide, flat basin rimmed in the distance by purpled mountains. She originally intended to use them for herself \u2014 ironically, between occasional afternoon visitors and the residents who come for longer stays in exchange for help with site maintenance, A-Z West is such a hive these days that Zittel rarely has the alone time she craves \u2014 but like most elements in her life, the cabins have become part of her work, perhaps even the ultimate expression of it."]
["t-magazine", "When she bought the land in Wonder Valley, she was in the midst of making a series of sculptures called \u201cPlanar Configurations,\u201d based on her longstanding fascination with the \u201cplanar panel\u201d \u2014 basically, anything that is rectangular, whether a 4-by-8 piece of plywood, a 8\u00bd-by-11 sheet of printer paper or a table top. Each sculpture, made of wood, red fiberglass and black-matte aluminum or steel, is a set of interconnected rectangles, like a 3D Mondrian, that function as a table, bed, counter and room divider. Last year, Zittel, always frustrated by how few people actually get to interact with her work, and ever on the lookout for ways to finance her many projects, had a revelation: She could put a \u201cPlanar Configuration\u201d inside each of the cabins, and allow people to stay in them, for rates comparable to a nearby Airbnb. It would be the first time that a stranger could reside in Zittel\u2019s universe full time, in utter privacy, in contrast to the \u201cWagon Station Encampment\u201d with its communal ethos and group activities."]
["t-magazine", "The \u201cExperimental Living Cabins,\u201d at which I am one of the first guests, are intended for solo visitors who stay anywhere from two days to three weeks, and though a smattering of boxy one-story houses dot the area, they are so low, and so distant, that it\u2019s easy to forget they exist at all. One can go for days without human interaction, or one can hop in the car and drive down the dirt road to the Palms Restaurant for a beer. The point of the cabins isn\u2019t to enact the now-clich\u00e9d off-the-grid adventure, but to exist just a few steps outside real life, in a stripped-down but completely functional environment \u2014 to re-examine, even relearn, everyday activities. A welcome disorientation, even an epiphany or two, might arise from doing without conventional touchstones like, say, a mirror, or a refrigerator. (Visitors are given a supply of bottled water, but bring in their own food and ice to stock the cooler.) And there is plenty of furniture in the literal sense, just not anything that reads easily as such. \u201cI do believe in a certain amount of comfort,\u201d Zittel says. \u201cI believe in having a good spot to position your body so you can relax and do things. But I want people to find their own comfort without being catered to. It\u2019s not just waiting there for you.\u201d"]
["t-magazine", "She is intimately familiar with the comfortable-uncomfortable sensation that the cabins can evoke; it characterized her early years in the desert. When Zittel left Brooklyn in 2000, many in the art world viewed it as a surprising retrenchment or even the end of her career. She had spent almost a decade represented by the acclaimed Andrea Rosen Gallery, showing such apparently urban-inflected works as the 1994 \u201cA-Z Living Units,\u201d a precursor to the \u201cPlanar Configurations\u201d \u2014 portable pods that seemed inspired by cramped studios: Barbie\u2019s-Dreamhouse-by-way-of-Bauhaus. Although she had grown up north of San Diego and spent time at her grandparents\u2019 ranch in California\u2019s Imperial Valley, she didn\u2019t yearn for the wilderness in her 10 years in New York. There were no signs in her work of the organic monumentalism synonymous with the sculptors and conceptualists who first decamped for the desert, and she didn\u2019t seem the type to erect a permanent museum of her art, as did the assemblage artist Noah Purifoy, a pioneer when he left L.A. for Joshua Tree in the 1980s. Nor did she give indications of wanting to create a conventional home and burrow into a solitary relationship with two-dimensional work, as had the female artists who famously forsook New York City for the Southwest, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Agnes Martin. She was social, hosting weekly cocktail parties in her Williamsburg townhouse."]
["t-magazine", "But as others began discovering Brooklyn, she began feeling a pull toward the sun-blasted, desolate terrain of her childhood. Zittel sees herself as part of the 20th-century tradition of American artists leaving cities for the open spaces of the Southwest, but she is aware of her deviations. O\u2019Keeffe and Martin chose the desert as a form of retreat, but Zittel saw it as liberation. As for the parallels often drawn between her and the largely male artists who came to make their massive, macho marks on the desert, she gently notes that she is not interested in \u201cgrand interventions,\u201d only in finding meaning in intimate, everyday gestures. \u201cThe act of inhabiting and having an evolving relationship with a space or place is inherently different from the act of installing works like \u2018Spiral Jetty\u2019 or \u2018Double Negative,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says. During my stay in the cabin, I established a routine determined by the movements of the sun: After daylight nudged me awake around five, I rose from the bed portion of the \u201cPlanar Configuration\u201d and unlocked both doors to let in the early cross-breeze. Then I scooped ant corpses from the ice cooler and retrieved my sack of ground coffee. I checked my shoes for scorpions/tarantulas, and stepped outside to the composting toilet. I\u2019d save the outdoor shower \u2014 a water tank modified with a hand pump \u2014 for later in the day, when the heat was unbearable. Then it was off to assess the dwindling freshwater reserve and to conduct frugal ablutions over a steel sink that drained through a black hose into a bucket below. I filled the kettle. Ignited the propane stove. Set out French press, bowl and spoon. (In keeping with Zittel\u2019s catechism, there are only bowls, never glasses or plates, which she deems unnecessarily use-specific.) Carried two black wooden vintage stools out to the patio, one for sitting, the other for my breakfast and books. Every time a bead of perspiration rolled down my leg, I\u2019d assume it was an ant and tried to flick it off, never learning."]
["t-magazine", "In the afternoon, the hot wind in my face like a blow dryer on high, I drove to the air-conditioned local library, with Zittel\u2019s blessing; the cabin stay is meant to be challenging but not life-threatening. Back home around 6:00 p.m., I cooked a meal of spiced beans, avocado and tortillas and washed up in the final sliver of sun. After lighting the oil lanterns, I watched their flickering patterns, then sat outside to read. By 9:30 p.m. I was asleep, atop white sheets, enveloped in unbroken darkness. Before my trip, I\u2019d been thinking about Zittel in relation to the social-utopia-makers of the 19th century, the \u201cmaterial feminists\u201d who sought liberation by transforming the domestic sphere. In 1868, Melusina Fay Peirce, an organizer and author, spearheaded the \u201ccooperative housekeeping movement,\u201d proposing that wives charge their husbands for their domestic labor. The writer and reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman argued for taking the kitchen out of the house, making it communal and hiring cooks to lessen the burden of \u201cwomen\u2019s work.\u201d Could Zittel\u2019s heady innovations be postmodern descendants of these ideas?"]
["t-magazine", "But perched on a stool with the oil lamp and a book, the night astonishingly silent save for a lone coyote in the distance, I realized that Zittel isn\u2019t interested in changing society or achieving political or social perfection, but is instead seeking liberation of a more private sort. Because here\u2019s the strange thing: I never did get bored, or lonely, or restless during my stint in Zittel\u2019s world. For all my physical discomfort throughout the week, I felt deeply, supremely calm. Existing alone in an unfamiliar space in which every detail has been considered and honed to its ultimate function was simultaneously soothing and stimulating. Engaged so closely with my immediate surroundings, I was able to drown out my ever-present anxieties. Bowls were no longer just bowls: They were the sole necessary vessel. Without a chair back, I sat up taller and lay down on the ground to watch the stars. I began to see the cabins as performance art, but with the artist herself absent \u2014 or, maybe, with the viewer taking the artist\u2019s role. There was a kind of generosity, or trust, in that gesture. Among the materials Zittel had left me \u2014 an idiosyncratic mix that included Viktor E. Frankl\u2019s \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning,\u201d back issues of \u201cLapham\u2019s Quarterly\u201d and local travel guides \u2014 was an ancient paperback, \u201cFlatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.\u201d First published in 1884 by Edwin A. Abbott, an English theologian who wrote the novel under the pseudonym A. Square, it is an Euclidean sci-fi fantasy about a civilization of polygons who inhabit an alternate two-dimensional reality \u2014 not my usual genre, but during the long nights, I gave myself over to the barely sublimated satire of Victorian values."]
["t-magazine", "In the days and weeks following, long after I returned home, I saw rectangles everywhere \u2014 counter, bed, ceiling, blanket, book, cover, page. Even a line of text is a long, narrow rectangle. Viewed like this, through Zittel\u2019s eyes, the material world seemed endlessly malleable, little more than a sequence of man-made conventions we\u2019ve all agreed to preserve, whether or not they have outlived their usefulness, that were now merely burying \u2014 or distracting \u2014 us with infinite variety. I also came to see \u201cFlatland\u201d as more than a brainy curiosity or even a nod to Zittel\u2019s obsession with geometry. Perhaps it was best read as a primer for the alternate reality she has single-handedly engineered, one that rejects society while remaining in rapt conversation with it. I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask Zittel about the book before I returned to New York \u2014 the cacophonous, often disconnected city she abandoned long ago. I will never know why she left it out for me. What I did know, without her having to utter a word, was this: She is always thinking about everything, about every detail that adds up to a life, and that includes you."]
["opinion", "Baseball Lowers the Boom - The New York Times Major League Baseball suspended 13 players on Monday for violating antidoping rules, in its most sweeping and consequential enforcement action of the steroid era. The suspensions were expected but, nonetheless, striking because included was baseball\u2019s highest-paid star, Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees, who received the longest suspension ever: 211 games, through the 2014 season. The other players were banned for 50 games, including three All-Stars: Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers, Everth Cabrera of the San Diego Padres and Jhonny Peralta of the Detroit Tigers. The league accused Rodriguez not just of using testosterone and human growth hormone for many years but also of trying to \u201cobstruct and frustrate\u201d its investigation of the South Florida anti-aging clinic, Biogenesis, at the center of the scandal. Now we\u2019re in for a period of awkwardness with Rodriguez, the only player of the 13 not to accept his suspension. As he pursues an appeal, he will still be allowed to play. There will be arguments over whether the players\u2019 punishment was too much, too little or just right, and disagreements about Rodriguez\u2019s eventual place in or out of the Hall of Fame, which, in a fitting reflection of the current state of baseball, inducted no living players this year. Rodriguez\u2019s looming banishment would be a pathetic ending for a perennial All-Star and Most Valuable Player who, since starting as a teenager with the Seattle Mariners in 1993, was on a trajectory for glory.

This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing. Bar Bolonat opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in, Einat Admony, the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird. Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen."]

I\u2019d never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn\u2019t in a big hurry to face the decibels again. Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it\u2019s not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It\u2019s also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty. While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move."]

One of Bar Bolonat\u2019s most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat\u2019s is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green. A swipe of corn pur\u00e9e takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony\u2019s version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg. Nearly everybody orders the Jerusalem-style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it\u2019s almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za\u2019atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil. When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. \u201cZa\u2019atar ravioli,\u201d stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za\u2019atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat\u2019s zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry."]

The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren\u2019t telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife. The bit about the dishes\u2019 showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony\u2019s intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut."]

The halvah cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the fried ice cream at Chi-Chi\u2019s.

Dressed in layers, hats and extra socks, the couple pretends to be homeless. They will join about 200 other decoys who will be paid to act as if they live on the street during the Homeless Outreach Population Estimate, the city\u2019s annual census of unsheltered homeless people, as a way gauging the count\u2019s accuracy. Like many of the decoys, Ms. Egyptt and Mr. Lubonski have experienced homelessness, living in subway stations or parks, abandoned homes or on the streets. \u201cWhen New York City had a blizzard up to here,\u201d Ms. Egyptt said, placing her hand at her stomach, \u201cI was on the street.\u201d The city enlists thousands of volunteers for the four-hour, overnight canvass, an undertaking that would cost far more without the unpaid search parties. The decoys shoulder the responsibility of testing the accuracy of a survey carried out by volunteers who are sometimes too timid to approach homeless people or are too inattentive to spot them. The annual count, scheduled for Monday, is part of a nationwide estimate of homelessness, which helps to determine annual federal grants. The city uses the percentage of decoys who are not found as a margin of error, one of several factors used to come up with the final estimate. \u201cAll of our efforts here are essentially checking our work,\u201d said Steven Banks, the city\u2019s commissioner of social services."]

The city estimated that 3,900 people lived unsheltered during last year\u2019s census, accounting for about 5 percent of the city\u2019s 77,000 homeless people. Still, there was a 40 percent jump in street homelessness over the previous year, which city officials attributed to unseasonably warm weather. But advocates for homeless people have long argued that the unsheltered population is likely higher, since people find temporary relief with friends and family during inclement weather. For the rest of the year, thousands of people choose the street over a warm shelter bed. Ms. Egyptt and Mr. Lubonski, 53, pointed to the lax security and squalid conditions of shelters. \u201cMy boots got stolen. I got stabbed,\u201d Mr. Lubonski said. \u201cMold in the showers,\u201d Ms. Egyptt said, shaking her head.

She said she slept on a bed of old clothes. \u201cI had that apartment looking like it was mine,\u201d she said, laughing at her ingenuity.

They shared advice and swapped stories as Christine H. Kim, the project manager for the count, went over logistics and dos and don\u2019ts. Decoys must work in pairs, standing or sitting 10 to 15 feet apart on a street, train or subway platform. Volunteers cannot be faulted for failing to find decoys who are not where they were supposed to be. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re not even there,\u201d Ms. Kim told decoys.

["upshot", "Questions to Consider if Your Trump-Clinton Vote Doesn\u2019t Really Count - The New York Times If you live in California, the value of your vote this November will be much smaller than a neighbor\u2019s a few miles away in Nevada. The same contrast exists along many other state borders, like those of Vermont and New Hampshire. That\u2019s because the Electoral College system leaves people in deeply red or deeply blue states relative bystanders in presidential elections \u2014 even when a race is desperately close. If you live in safe blue states like California or Vermont or a safe red one like Alabama, is it possible to make your vote count more? First, some perspective: Even in a battleground state like Nevada, where the Electoral College votes could help tip the election, one person\u2019s vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference. When millions vote, a single ballot can be like a teaspoon of water in a swimming pool. But the distortions of the Electoral College can still be surprising. According to Upshot estimates as well as those of FiveThirtyEight, Nevada and New Hampshire, small in population and politically divided, are the top two states in a measure of voting power per person. (Another effect of the Electoral College is that residents of smaller states have more voting power on average than those of larger ones.) Forty states have voted for the same party in four straight presidential elections. And the electoral map doesn\u2019t look all that different this fall."]
["upshot", "That means that roughly the same swing states have continued to wield influence. And two of those already have outsize sway for a reason other than the Electoral College: Iowa and New Hampshire traditionally shape the race with early primary contests. Another separate reason that New Hampshire might be a power broker this year is that a close down-ballot race \u2014 Kelly Ayotte vs. Maggie Hassan \u2014 could determine which party controls the Senate. At the other extreme are states like California, Texas and New York. Their combined population is more than a fourth of the United States total, and their residents are essentially sitting out another presidential election. With these disparities in mind, I asked Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, about some of the laws that govern how people can try to maximize their influence. He also writes The Election Law Blog. Here\u2019s a lightly edited version of our email conversation: Q. Vote buying is obviously illegal. But what about gray areas? 1) Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a Californian and you\u2019re feeling left out of the election. You have a nephew in Florida who is apolitical and a big sports fan. You tell him that if he votes for Donald J. Trump, you\u2019ll take him to a Lakers game and a nice dinner the next time he visits Los Angeles. (It\u2019s understood that you\u2019ll pay for the tickets and dinner because that\u2019s what you normally do on such occasions.) Would that be considered against the law? If so, and if it somehow ever came to light, what might the penalty be?"]
["upshot", "2) Or another example. You have an 18-year-old niece in Ohio; she\u2019s undecided and unsure if she\u2019ll vote. For her birthday, you give her $100 instead of the usual $50, give her a wink in front of her family and say, \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s a bribe, but if you vote for Hillary Clinton, I certainly won\u2019t mind.\u201d (Everyone chuckles.) A. These questions are similar to those that commonly come up in bribery prosecutions. When is there enough evidence of a deal (a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d exchange) to show that the transaction is illegal. 1) Certainly if I say to a stranger, if you vote for Trump I will give you Laker tickets and take you to dinner \u2014 that would be a bribe. The fact that it is an uncle and nephew with a pre-existing relationship may make proving the deal harder, especially if there is a history of the uncle giving gifts to the nephew. Under a federal statute (52 U.S.C. s 10307(c)), \u201cWhoever knowingly or willfully \u2026 pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years.\u201d 2) Like the first example, it turns on intent, and the familial relationship may make it harder to prove it is illegal vote buying. But if the aunt says to the niece, \u201cI will give you $50 to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d that could well be found to cross the line."]
["upshot", "Q.  College students can have the choice to vote in their college town instead of their hometown, with the possibility of choosing a battleground state over a safe state. Do some states make it tougher for out-of-state college students to register and vote? A. There have been instances in which local officials have made it harder for college students to vote. This is not just an issue for presidential elections, but for local elections as well, where people who live in a town don\u2019t want college students to swamp their votes. The Supreme Court, however, has ruled that college students have the right to vote at the place they consider their residence \u2014 Symm v. United States, 439 U.S. 1105 (1979). Still, states sometimes do things that make it harder for students to vote, such as imposing strict voter identification rules but not accepting IDs issued by colleges for proof of identity. Texas, for example, accepts concealed weapons permits but not student IDs. Sometimes local bodies refuse to put polling stations near colleges. The Brennan Center offers a Student Voting Guide that helps students navigate the sometimes complex rules for voting. [Note: Last week, The Times published a guide to voter registration deadlines, state by state.] Q. If someone owns homes in different states and wants to choose to vote in a state that is a battleground, how much leeway does that person have?"]
["upshot", "A. The clear rule is that a person can have only one residence for voting at a time, and one cannot vote twice in the same election for president. There is some leeway on establishing what counts as one\u2019s residence. An article in the Election Law Journal explores this issue for college students, but it is a much broader issue, and the question of what counts as one\u2019s residence can be murky. Here\u2019s how the Federal Voting Assistance Program explains it for military and other overseas voters: \u201cYour voting residence is within your State of legal residence or domicile. It is the true, fixed address that you consider your permanent home and where you had a physical presence. Your State of legal residence is used for State income tax purposes, and determines eligibility to vote for federal and State elections and qualification for in-state tuition rates.\u201d There has been a movement to allow nonresidents to vote in certain local elections when they are vacation homeowners, but that doesn\u2019t affect the rule about voting only once in presidential elections. Q.  Internet-aided vote swapping seems to have occurred first in the 2000 election. Some partisans of Al Gore and Ralph Nader had a friendly arrangement to help Gore in swing states in exchange for helping Nader in safely Democratic states. It seems to have worked, but the problem for Gore is that the swapping didn\u2019t happen quite enough. What would be considered crossing the line, and what type of dynamic could we see this fall?"]
["upshot", "A. In this election, it would allow, for example, a Jill Stein supporter in a swing state like Ohio to vote for Hillary Clinton in exchange for a Clinton supporter in a safe state like California to agree to vote for Jill Stein. The supposed benefit of this trade is that the Ohio voter helps Clinton get elected in a place where a vote for a third-party candidate can act as a spoiler, but Stein\u2019s overall popular vote totals would be the same, potentially entitling Stein to some public financing for her campaign and showing the candidate\u2019s popularity. Some have claimed that vote swapping constitutes illegal vote buying under federal law or state statutes. The California Secretary of State went after a website that offered vote swapping in the 2000 election, claiming that it violated state anti-vote buying prohibitions. The case,  Porter v. Bowen, went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that the activity was protected by the First Amendment and did not raise the danger of an exchange of money for votes. The state tried to take it to the full Ninth Circuit, which refused to take the case.  Three judges, however, issued a dissenting statement suggesting that vote swapping is illegal vote buying not protected by the First Amendment, and it is quite possible that another court would agree with the dissenters should the issue arise again. [Update: A website has been created for such vote swapping, and there\u2019s also a site aimed at Republicans.]"]
["upshot", "Q. What\u2019s your own view on the legality of vote swapping? A. I am uncertain whether vote swapping would count as illegal vote buying. One key point is that these kinds of agreements are inherently unenforceable, given the secret ballot. You might tell me you are Stein supporter in Ohio who would vote for Clinton if I would vote for Stein, but you could be someone sitting in another country, or a Stein supporter in Ohio who still plans to vote for Stein. But the larger point is that people are looking for ways around the fact that we have this odd system, where we make it really easy for third-party candidates to get on the ballot in most places, but almost impossible for them to win. A much more rational solution to this problem would be to adopt instant runoff voting [in which voters rank candidates in order of preference] so that a vote for Stein could go to Clinton (or for Gary Johnson could go to Trump) if that\u2019s a voter\u2019s second choice."]

["business", "And while Starbucks typically pays more than the minimum wage, unlike some other chains, the $10 to $15 hourly wages of its 130,000 baristas are often barely enough to make ends meet. The same holds true at other employers participating in the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative, like Walmart and Taco Bell. For his part, Mr. Schultz acknowledged that even hiring 100,000 young people falls far short of addressing the question of where millions of unemployed will find a niche in the modern economy, where credentials and technical skills are now essential for jobs that once required only a high school diploma. But he is hoping more companies sign on, and that the 100,000 goal will serve as an initial target as momentum builds. \u201cYou have to start somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to create the largest employer-led coalition creating pathways to good jobs for young people.\u201d Noting Starbucks\u2019s new effort to subsidize employees as they work toward their bachelor\u2019s degree, Mr. Schultz added: \u201cOur initiative doesn\u2019t end with a job.

["books", "Girl Crazy - The New York Times STILL SHE HAUNTS ME By Katie Roiphe. 228 pp. New York: The Dial Press. $23.95. ''I'm fond of children (except boys),'' Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, once wrote. It's a line that conveys both the loopy contrarian logic and the conflicted preoccupation with young girls that we've come to associate with the author of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' and it appears early in ''Still She Haunts Me,'' Katie Roiphe's first novel. Roiphe plunges us into Dodgson's girl-love by dramatizing his seven-year relationship with his favorite, Alice Liddell, the inspiration for his children's classic and the daughter of the dean of the Oxford college where Dodgson was a mathematics lecturer. In 1863, Dodgson's visits with Alice and her sisters ended after he received a terse letter from their mother asking him to stay away from the family, for reasons that are still unknown. Did Dodgson ask the 11-year-old Alice's parents for her hand in marriage, as some scholars have guessed, or did he go too far in one of his photography sessions with the child? Roiphe, the author of two nonfiction books, ''The Morning After'' and ''Last Night in Paradise,'' has a theory about how Dodgson landed in this artistically productive but emotionally bewildering mess. Her Dodgson is a lonely, thwarted stutterer, hung up on rules and regulations, mournful about the passage of time. Playing with and photographing small girls soothes him; their taut bodies and wild imaginations are the antithesis of wide-hipped, well-behaved adult womanhood; being with them also helps redress his own childhood memories of being dominated by his sisters."]
["books", "Roiphe's is not, it must be said, an original or unexpected view of Dodgson or of a mind obsessed with young girls -- Nabokov himself remarked on the ''pathetic affinity'' between Dodgson and Humbert Humbert -- and when she ventures into less charted corners of this story, her themes, such as her insistence on Mrs. Liddell's watchful envy of her daughter, feel heavy-handed. Still, Roiphe conveys an adroit, plausible picture of Dodgson's inner turmoil and the process by which it was converted into the ''Alice'' books. Her prose style is often too portentous, overloaded with sentence fragments (''A man and a girl. A man and his idea of a girl. Lifted out of poems like Wordsworth's 'We Are Seven,' '' and so on, until you long for a verb). But it's precise and resolute, suited to depicting Dodgson's impacted personality and to giving us charged glimpses of Alice's point of view as she is beckoned to the brink of erotic awareness by Dodgson's attention. There are some captivating passages, like one in which Dodgson finally lets himself imagine a future with Alice and is stymied by ''the great gaping hole in his plan, a kind of frenetic blackness at its very center.''"]
["books", "But the novel's strengths are undermined by Roiphe's penchant for bolstering her ideas with undigested pieces of historical evidence, from a Victorian essay on photography to the plots of the popular novels through which Mrs. Liddell forms her view of life. Roiphe hasn't allowed her research to submerge itself in an imaginative narrative; she lapses frequently into point-making and explication, and the result is that ''Still She Haunts Me'' never lifts off as a work of fiction. And while Roiphe has an often acute sense of her characters' psychology, no two of them seem to be inhabiting the same novel. This makes sense, perhaps, when it comes to the isolated Dodgson. But the scenes in which she allows other people to interact feel stiff and truncated, as if she's in a hurry to get back to explaining their personalities and motivations and interpreting assorted artifacts of their world for us. In one crucial scene, a boating trip during which Dodgson begins telling the story that became ''Alice,'' Roiphe informs us that ''the London Meteorological Society recorded the weather around Oxford on July 4, 1862, as 'rather cool and wet,' '' while Dodgson later remembered a sky of ''cloudless blue.'' Then comes a mini-lecture on Dodgson's ''capacity for instant nostalgia.'' Did she really need to drag in the London Meteorological Society? At moments like that you can't help feeling that Roiphe's brawny authorial presence is better suited to polemic (like her previous books), where her energetically wielded bits of evidence aren't so likely to kill the reader's buzz."]
["sports/baseball", "Yankees Wait, and Wait, and Wait, and Then Lose - The New York Times Before the start of the ninth inning of the Yankees\u2019 game against the Texas Rangers on Monday night, Aroldis Chapman warmed up in the bullpen, preparing to help the Yankees escape with a one-run victory in what had become a rain-soaked affair. Chapman trudged his way through the wet grass of the outfield while the grounds crew worked furiously to sprinkle bags of infield conditioner along the dirt, trying to absorb excess moisture on a surface with a consistency that had begun to resemble porridge. When Chapman finished his warm-up tosses and Rangers catcher Robinson Chirinos, the ninth hitter in the order, stepped into the box, workers were still raking over soft patches, creating a diamond that mimicked the pattern of a marbled rye, with new and dampened dirt mixing together. Through earlier innings and an uninterrupted rain that had never deviated much in force, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi had not publicly displayed concern. Once the grounds crew exited the field, perhaps Girardi began noticing the muddy puddles that had incrementally increased in depth along the borders of the dugouts. Or maybe the indicator that conditions might no longer be conducive to baseball came when Chapman did not display the usual zip on his fastball, falling short of the 100-mile-per-hour mark that he has frequently touched this season. Chirinos, a .178 hitter, watched the ball repeatedly sail wide of the zone for a 3-0 count. Two pitches later, Chirinos walked."]
["sports/baseball", "Shin-Soo Choo drew a 3-1 count. With that, Girardi stepped out of the Yankees\u2019 dugout, suddenly enlightened (or, perhaps, aware of the effect the weather was having on his closer\u2019s grip of the baseball). Girardi held a discussion with the umpiring crew, after which stadium workers were summoned to begin unrolling the tarp, bringing Rangers Manager Jeff Banister onto the field. In an animated meeting with umpires, Banister appeared to be question why now, after multiple hours of rain \u2014 and Chapman\u2019s control problems \u2014 the game was being halted. Banister appealed in vain. At 10:40 p.m., with the Yankees leading, 6-5, the game entered into a rain delay that lasted 3 hours 35 minutes. Coincidentally, the game had begun 21 minutes late, in anticipation of rain that did not come then. Had the game started on time, there might have been no controversial stop in the ninth inning. Crew Chief Paul Nauert said at no time up until the ninth did he feel the field condition or heaviness of the rain affected the game. He also said that neither manager complained to that point. After the game though, which the Rangers came back to win, 9-6, at 2:44 a.m., Girardi was lost as to why the game even reached the ninth inning, claiming that he thought the game could have been stopped in the seventh. \u201cFrustrating,\u201d Girardi bluntly replied when asked to describe the loss."]
["sports/baseball", "Nauert said that his crew\u2019s intention was to try to finish the game to give both teams \u201can equal, fair opportunity\u201d and that they were going to wait \u201cas long as we could.\u201d The Rangers had good reason to wait out the weather. By major league rules, had the game been called, it would have reverted to the end of the eighth inning, and the Yankees would have won. Instead, about 50 fans lingered impatiently through a storm that grew in intensity as Tuesday morning arrived. Police officers, guarding the field without jackets or umbrellas, stood in uniforms glued to their bodies from the precipitation after they had remained in place for three hours. At 1:40 a.m., three hours to the minute after the game was paused, the tarp was turned over in left field, ready to be rerolled. Girardi, having removed his jersey, examined the infield as Banister trailed close behind and Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman strolled around the perimeter. Brett Gardner stayed in the Yankees\u2019 dugout, arms folded, looking agitated. Eventually, the outlines of the batters\u2019 boxes were repainted white, and the Yankees\u2019 fielders began tossing along the first-base line while Barry Manilow\u2019s \u201cI Made It Through the Rain\u201d played through the stadium\u2019s sound system. When play resumed at 2:15 a.m. Tuesday, the details of the early innings were all but forgotten. The Yankees had overcome a rocky start by Ivan Nova, who had allowed four runs in five innings. Rangers starter Chi Chi Gonzalez had fared no better, though, and the Yankees had tagged him for five runs and 10 hits in five innings."]
["sports/baseball", "Leading the charge were Carlos Beltran and Mark Teixeira. Hours after the Yankees announced that Alex Rodriguez would sit against a right-handed starter for the second straight day, Beltran moved into the designated hitter slot and picked up three hits, scoring two runs. Teixeira homered for the second consecutive game among his three hits, and he, too, scored twice. When the ninth inning resumed, as cleaning crews were already well into their work collecting debris in the upper level, the Rangers could be heard cheering on Choo. Their spirits had been lifted after hours of idleness and uncertainty, once they were informed that the game would be resumed. \u201cI wanted to win so bad today, because I don\u2019t think it was fair for where they called it, the game,\u201d Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre said. \u201cWe were playing the whole game in the rain, and to stop it right there in the ninth inning when we were trying to cook something, I didn\u2019t think it was fair.\u201d The encouragement for Choo was ultimately to no avail. Kirby Yates replaced Chapman and threw two strikes past Choo for the first out. Yates, however, failed to remain sharp. He proceeded to hit three batters in a four-run inning for the Rangers. Beltre\u2019s bases-loaded single drove in two runs, putting Texas ahead to stay, 7-6. Among those few still standing in the crowd were Beltre\u2019s children."]
["sports/baseball", "In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees\u2019 Starlin Castro beat out a throw by Elvis Andrus at shortstop for an infield single. Or so it appeared. The Rangers challenged the call, delaying the game another minute and 14 seconds. As with most stops in the game, this one was questionable \u2014 Castro was ruled safe. Four batters later, with runners on the corners and two outs, Jacoby Ellsbury flied out to left field, ending a contest that officially lasted 3 hours 43 minutes. At last, 7 hours 39 minutes after the scheduled start time, this game had a final score, like the 10 others that had long ago earned their \u201cF\u2019s\u201d on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard: Rangers 9, Yankees 6."]

The group, part of the NASA-funded HI-SEAS project, began living at the habitat in August. They are the fourth group to take up residence there, and will be staying longer than any before them. The work requires Ms. Heinicke to live in a 1,000-square-foot domed structure with five other people. Escaping cabin fever is possible, but it requires wearing a mock spacesuit outside. Life in the habitat can be isolating: During the attacks in Paris in November, Ms. Heinicke said she and her colleagues tried to keep up with the news on a delayed Internet connection. But the group hopes that its work will be helpful for any real missions to the red planet, and can be found actively documenting daily life on Twitter. Ms. Heinicke shared more about her life on \u201cMars\u201d: What about this experience has surprised you?  The first thing to surprise me was how spacious the habitat appears on the inside. It has a bit more than 1,000 square feet distributed over two floors, which is pretty small for six people."]

All our supplies are shelf-stable: Powdered eggs and milk, freeze-dried chicken, freeze-dried vegetables, clarified butter, dried fruits and tons of spices. We also have chocolate and some other snacks. Really, I am probably eating more healthily than during my life as a single before the start of the mission. What creature comforts are missing in your habitat?  None, actually. We are surprisingly well equipped: We have a common area with work spaces, a dining table, a treadmill and other sports equipment, some board games and a projector, among other things. It probably helps that we did not expect much to begin with, because a mission to Mars would only be able to bring the most essential items. What\u2019s the Internet situation like? "]

However, we are still full-time researchers working on our projects and, in addition, do have to spend more time on household tasks than on Earth. For example, before we can cook any of our food, we need to re-hydrate it; and if we have a power outage, we cannot simply call the electrical supply company, but we have to troubleshoot it ourselves, maybe with help over our time-delayed Internet.

["travel", "The Florida Keys by Camper Van, With Baby - The New York Times At $120 a night during Florida\u2019s notorious spring break, the Art Deco Hotel Shelley had seemed like a bargain. It even included a free airport shuttle to the hotel\u2019s South Beach address, walking distance from where we would pick up our camper van rental the next morning before making a beeline for the Florida Keys. When the shuttle arrived, it was impossible to miss. Wrapped in a wheels-to-roof vinyl ad, the bus was a mobile billboard splashed with the racy, larger-than-life image of a buxom woman \u2014 her blond hair thrown back, her face flushed \u2014 being caressed by a masked man, red silk around his neck. Next to the door was a slogan: \u201cQuirky + Sexy + Chic No-Tell Hotels.\u201d My husband, infant daughter and I climbed aboard. I had, it seemed, booked my family at what in Mexico is artfully referred to as a \u201clove motel.\u201d Well, I thought, no \u201cMom of the Year\u201d award for me. We staggered into the Shelley under the weight of suitcases, diaper bags, strollers and collapsible baby beds, piling them alongside the hotel bar, where a glossy international crowd sipped free drinks (another Shelley perk, from 7 to 8 nightly). Then, as if we had stumbled upon a semitropical knockoff of \u201cCheers,\u201d the crowd shouted to the new arrivals, \u201cHappy Hour!\u201d This isn\u2019t so bad, I thought, ordering a rum and tonic in a tiny plastic cup. And it wasn\u2019t. Our room was clean and quiet and, exhausted from a long day, our 9-month-old, Roxie, slept through the night."]
["travel", "For years, I had fantasized about a camper van and taking a weeklong road trip through the Florida Keys. After Roxie was born last summer, a camper seemed like the ideal introductory family vacation. With the van doubling as accommodations and transportation, we could camp our way down the Overseas Highway on a relatively modest budget without the hassle of hauling our camping gear cross-country. From the Shelley, we pushed Roxie in a combo car seat and stroller the half-mile to Escape Campervans, passing head shops selling assault rifle-shaped hookahs and Liquored Up stores with overflowing bins of travel-size spirits. We stopped at Las Olas Cafe, an old-school Cuban steam table spot, where for $13 we sat at a sidewalk table and shared a plastic foam container piled with picadillo, black beans, white rice and sticky plantains. The Escape Campervans office, hidden in a fountain courtyard, was a closet-size room stacked with camping gear and staffed by an affable South African expat named Leon. Nothing if not thorough, he spent an hour introducing us to our home for the week: \u201cTopiary,\u201d a converted Ford Econoline utility van painted in impressionistic multigreen foliage. Then he equipped us with maps and brochures, and offered recommendations for our Florida Keys road trip."]
["travel", "After picking up our luggage at the hotel, we drove south through the khaki, stucco and mauve Miami suburbs and an Everglades landscape that, from the highway, was a blur of shrub. I was desperate to see the Atlantic. But three and a half hours into our drive, there had been only brief flashes of the patchwork of Pantone ocean blues and greens I had been imagining for months. I wanted more. By the time we made it to Curry Hammock State Park, a tidy loop of campsites occupied by gargantuan R.V.s and separated from the shore by a wall of brush, I feared my expectations for the Keys, shaped by a fleeting childhood infatuation with Jimmy Buffett and, more recently, the Netflix noir series \u201cBloodline,\u201d had been too high. When our site turned out to be a shadeless gravel pad with a view of a wooden fence and the large concrete block structure housing bathrooms, I needed to redeem the day. I had fantasized about an oceanfront campsite, but I would settle for a cold beer and 30-cent peel-and-eat shrimp, which we found at Sparky\u2019s Landing, an over-the-water bar, where locals watched sports and tourists gawked at manatees on the deck. (We, sadly, missed a sea cow sighting by minutes.)"]
["travel", "My hopes for the trip resurrected, we stopped at Publix, the Florida-based grocery chain, where we stocked up on good-quality prepared dishes and salads from the deli section before returning to camp. But instead of heading straight for our site, we drove to the park\u2019s beach, where we sat at a picnic table watching dusk settle over the Atlantic. The palms pattered overhead and Roxie, a wide giddy smile across her tiny face, leaned into the warm wind, which smelled sweet and funky from decaying seaweed, as boat motors buzzed on the horizon. The next morning, I walked through the park and realized how pleasant it actually was. With my expectations adjusted, I noticed the comfortable space between the sites, which were surrounded by shrubby buttonwood trees, bay bean vines and lantana. Still, we didn\u2019t linger. We hit the beach, where we waded out into the shallow, pale blue water for Roxie\u2019s first dip into the ocean. My husband, Tim, and I passed her back and forth as she shrieked in wild, unrestrained excitement. She splashed and giggled, acting out the joy I feel every time I leap into warm, salty sea. From her enthusiasm, any remnant of my initial disappointment disappeared. I was all in."]
["travel", "For lunch, we drove on a potholed side road to Burdines Waterfront, a marina and boat fuel dock with a tiki-esque restaurant on stilts high above a mangrove channel. The open-air Chicki Tiki Bar & Grille was packed, so the host pulled a highchair up to the bar beneath a palm frond roof. Iced tea was served by the pitcher; Tim\u2019s beer came in a neoprene cozy; and we shared the house specialty, a huge green-chile cheeseburger. Roxie, meanwhile, befriended our tie-dye-wearing bartender who gave us a history lesson on the Overseas Highway and the grand plan of Henry Flagler (a founder of Standard Oil and essentially the creator of much of modern South Florida) to build a railroad all the way to Key West, which was once the largest city in the state. Despite the plaque that read, \u201cA bad day spent on the water still beats a good day spent at work,\u201d everyone at Burdines seemed to be relishing theirs. I\u2019d made a reservation at Bahia Honda, a state park wrapped in white sand, with views of the old Flagler railroad bridge. But Leon from the Escape Campervans office had recommended Big Pine Key Fishing Lodge, a private R.V. park and campground nearby. Since we already had reservations to spend our last two nights at Bahia Honda, I decided on a whim to give Big Pine Key a try. As soon as we arrived, I regretted my spontaneity. Our so-called rustic site had one scraggly shade tree along the rocky shore and no electricity \u2014 and, therefore, no fan, a major flaw in the South Florida heat. At dusk, the no-see-ums (tiny biting flies, stubbornly undeterred by repellents) attacked like an invisible army. But we zipped Roxie into a netted bassinet and took the brunt of the insect onslaught ourselves."]
["travel", "Thankfully, the rest of Big Pine Key\u2019s fauna was charming. There were aggressively friendly toy-size Key deer, which begged for picnic table scraps, and a regal great white heron that held court for hours. Fuchsia-legged ibis scampered at the waterline while cream-colored doves and brown pelicans flew in dance-troupe formation overhead. Then there were our fellow campers, who strolled the grounds at sunset, topped-off glasses of wine in hand. From Big Pine Key, we backtracked 35 miles to Long Key, a state park where every site has an ocean view, before heading another 65 miles south to Key West, where we spent two nights at Boyd\u2019s Key West. It was another crowded R.V. campground, but without the bugs. Tim was tied to his computer, working remotely, while Roxie and I made the best of the location, five miles from Key West\u2019s New Orleans-like historic district. We sat by the pool and explored the grounds, where iguanas and chickens roamed beneath palm trees. For dinner, we walked to Hogfish Bar and Grill, a seafood restaurant a short distance from Boyd\u2019s, where we splurged on garlic shrimp, which had become Roxie\u2019s favorite food. During Tim\u2019s off hours, we drove into town, where we ate breakfast at Cuban Coffee Queen, listened to a bluegrass quartet play barefoot in the garden at Blue Heaven, visited the lush (and free) botanic garden at the Key West Garden Club and walked onto the White Street Fishing Pier just as the sky grew dark and rain started to fall. I even bought a container of conch chowder from a woman selling it out of the trunk of her car. For $8, it was the best meal we had all week."]

But we weren\u2019t any more tired than our new normal as parents of an infant. Fortunately, the things to do at Bahia Honda didn\u2019t require much of us. Our site, tucked into the foliage at the northern end of the park, was secluded. A sandy path led to a long beach and, for two days, we did little but swim in the ocean, which was everything I had fantasized about during the months leading up to our trip. It looked like a glass marble threaded with shimmering blues and greens, and had gentle, baby-size waves. At dusk, the dolphins swam past in a tight pod. The sky was deep black and the stars were silver spurs. After Roxie fell asleep, Tim and I played music on our iPhones, the volume low, and slow-danced like honeymooners. The trip hadn\u2019t been as carefree as our prebaby travels, but nine months into parenthood, we were finding our rhythm."]
["us", "THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE ARIZONA SENATOR; McCain Plans Renewed Push To Change Finance Laws - The New York Times Just a day after President Bush was sworn into office, Senator John McCain served notice today that he planned a broad grass-roots campaign to press for an overhaul of the campaign finance law. Appearing on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, stepped into the president's inaugural weekend limelight to set out his plan to reduce the influence of money on politics. Mr. Bush and Republican Congressional leaders oppose the measure. At the bill's center is a ban on the large, unregulated contributions to the political parties known as soft money that have allowed the parties to get around the donation limits enacted after Watergate. But in a new tradeoff intended to increase Republican support for the bill, Mr. McCain is proposing increasing the limits on how much individuals can give cumulatively in regulated money to federal candidates and parties. Playing off Mr. Bush's promises to change the tone in the capital, Mr. McCain said, ''If you want to really change the tone in Washington, you're going to have to reduce the influence of special interests.'' Mr. McCain's drive presents Mr. Bush with an early challenge on a difficult issue from the man who was his chief primary opponent. But Mr. McCain insisted today that he was not trying to pre-empt the president and he softened his demand for instant Senate consideration of the bill. He said he would be willing to compromise and take up the issue in late March."]

Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain are to meet on Wednesday and Bush advisers spoke of the possibility of compromise. But Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, said on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that Mr. Bush wanted any campaign finance bill to require unions to get members' explicit consent before using their dues for political purposes. Democrats, who have close ties to organized labor and provide most of the votes for Mr. McCain's bill, have long opposed such a measure. On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Karl Rove, another Bush aide, said an ''interesting concept'' was the idea of making the same requirement for using corporate shareholders' money. After Mr. McCain trounced him in the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Bush unveiled his own proposal to ban soft money donations by unions and corporations but not by individuals. Though the House has twice voted for the overhaul of the campaign finance laws, the bill has died in a Senate filibuster. Republican leaders say it would create a contribution disadvantage for their party and also argue it would infringe on free speech. Its prospects in Congress, however, look brighter this year. Democrats have picked up four Senate seats and Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, has backed the bill for the first time, possibly giving Mr. McCain and his co-sponsor, Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster."]

Mr. McCain continued to say today that he would tie up the Senate if he is not promised a reasonably early debate. But one Republican strategist said Mr. McCain could lose some of his Republican supporters if he appeared to be trying to jam Mr. Bush. Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold plan to introduce the new and more comprehensive version of their bill on Monday. It would ban soft money but  it would raise the cap on cumulative contributions by an individual to all federal candidates and parties in a single year to $30,000 from $25,000. It would also double to $10,000 the amount that individuals could contribute in regulated money to state party committees to use in federal elections. The measure would bar unions and corporations from running thinly disguised campaign advertisements within 30 days of a primary or 60 days before a general election. And it would require more disclosure from other groups running such advertisements. Mr. McCain said today that he would take the fight to overhaul the finance laws out of the Senate and to the states of the bill's opponents. He plans to go on the road with his signature town hall meetings and his onetime campaign aides have been working to create a coalition across the political spectrum to support the bill."]
["us/politics", "Senate Republicans, Preparing New Health Bill, Have No Votes to Spare - The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 The likely defection of two Senate Republicans has left their leaders no margin for error as they move on Thursday to unveil another version of their bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 without an assurance that they have the votes even to begin debate next week. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky flatly declared on Wednesday that he would not vote to take up the bill, which he said left too much of President Barack Obama\u2019s health law in place. Senator Susan Collins of Maine has gone almost as far, saying that the bill cuts too much and that only major revisions could win her over.

A lunch meeting of Republican senators on Wednesday ended with no clear consensus. After scrapping plans for a vote last month, the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wants to try again next week. But senators have shown few signs of substantial progress toward the needed 50 votes. Mr. Paul said on Wednesday that the revised version of Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill was even worse than the original proposal.

But we\u2019re trying to find middle ground.\u201d Mr. McConnell has been considering changes in his bill that would increase insurance subsidies for low-income people and preserve two taxes imposed on high-income people by the Affordable Care Act. The bill is still expected to make huge changes in Medicaid, putting caps on federal payments to states and rolling back the expansion of the program under the Affordable Care Act that has extended insurance to millions of people. One issue still up in the air is a proposal by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, that would allow insurers to sell less comprehensive plans if they also offered at least one option that complied with federal standards. The stripped-down plans could omit certain types of coverage, such as maternity or mental health care. Groups representing patients and insurers flooded Senate offices Wednesday with correspondence opposing the proposal. \u201cThe Cruz proposal would result in higher, not lower, premiums for people with serious and chronic conditions,\u201d said a letter from 13 patient advocacy groups including the American Heart Association and the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society."]

Democrats say the policy goal outweighs the budgetary impact. \u2022 Age ratios. The bill would let insurers charge older consumers five times as much as young adults. Under the Affordable Care Act, they can charge no more than three times as much. Democrats say the purpose of the change is regulatory, not budgetary. \u2022 Waiting period. People who went without insurance for approximately two months or more in the prior year would be required to wait six months before they could start coverage under the Senate bill.

But then a law professor named Michelle Alexander took the stage and delivered an impassioned speech attacking the war on drugs as a system of racial control comparable to slavery and Jim Crow \u2014 and received a two-minute standing ovation from the 500 people in the audience. \u201cThese were not young people living in high-crime neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, now police superintendent in Chicago, recalled in telephone interview. \u201cThis was the black middle class.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the government conspiracy, but what you have to accept is that that narrative exists in the community and has to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my real a-ha moment.\u201d Mr. McCarthy is not alone. During the past two years Professor Alexander has been provoking such moments across the country \u2014 and across the political spectrum \u2014 with her book, \u201cThe New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,\u201d which has become a surprise best seller since its paperback version came out in January.

Today, Professor Alexander writes, nearly one-third of black men are likely to spend time in prison at some point, only to find themselves falling into permanent second-class citizenship after they get out. That is a familiar argument made by many critics of the criminal justice system, but Professor Alexander\u2019s book goes further, asserting that the crackdown was less a response to the actual explosion of violent crime than a deliberate effort to push back the gains of the civil rights movement. For many African-Americans, the book \u2014 which has spent six weeks on the New York Times paperback nonfiction best-seller list \u2014 gives eloquent and urgent expression to deep feelings that the criminal justice system is stacked against them. \u201cEveryone in the African-American community had been seeing exactly what she is talking about but couldn\u2019t put it into words,\u201d said Phillip Jackson, executive director of the Black Star Project, an educational advocacy group in Chicago that has been blasting its 60,000 e-mail subscribers with what Mr. Jackson called near-daily messages about the book and Professor Alexander since he saw a video of her speaking in 2010.

But Professor Alexander, who teaches at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University, said in an interview that the more provocative claims of her book did not come easily to her. When she first encountered the \u201cNew Jim Crow\u201d metaphor on a protest sign in Oakland, Calif., a decade ago, she was a civil rights lawyer with an impeccable r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 Stanford Law School, a Supreme Court clerkship \u2014 and was leery of embracing arguments that might be considered, as she put it, \u201ccrazy.\u201d Professor Alexander, who is black, knew that African-Americans were overrepresented in prison, though she resisted the idea that this was anything more than unequal implementation of colorblind laws. But her work as director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Racial Justice Project in Northern California, she said, opened her eyes to the extent of the lifelong exclusion many offenders face, including job discrimination, elimination from juries and voter rolls, and even disqualification from food stamps, public housing and student loans."]

This system is out of sight, out of mind.\u201d In conversation, she disputes any suggestion that she is describing a conspiracy.

But to some of the book\u2019s detractors, including those deeply sympathetic to her goal of ending mass incarceration, its scholarship falls short. In an article to be published next month in The New York University Law Review, James Forman Jr., a clinical professor at Yale Law School and a former public defender, calls mass incarceration a social disaster but challenges what he calls Professor Alexander\u2019s \u201cmyopic\u201d focus on the war on drugs. Painting the war on drugs as mainly a backlash against the gains of the civil rights movement, Professor Forman writes, ignores the violent crime wave of the 1970s and minimizes the support among many African-Americans for get-tough measures. Furthermore, he argues, drug offenders make up less than 25 percent of the nation\u2019s total prison population, while violent offenders \u2014 who receive little mention in \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d \u2014 make up a much larger share. \u201cEven if every single one of these drug offenders were released tomorrow,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe United States would still have the world\u2019s largest prison system.\u201d To Professor Alexander, however, that argument neglects the full scope of the problem. Our criminal \u201ccaste system,\u201d as she calls it, affects not just the 2.3 million people behind bars, but also the 4.8 million others on probation or parole (predominately for nonviolent offenses), to say nothing of the millions more whose criminal records stigmatize them for life."]

The reports on the cellphone connections come after weeks of mounting evidence of ties between Belgium and the assailants in France. They also raise questions about the breadth of the terrorist network surrounding the attackers and challenge an assumption that one of them, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was the chief planner. Instead, the reports suggest, Mr. Abaaoud may been reporting back to someone more senior. An account of the police reports, which first appeared in the French newspaper Le Monde on Wednesday and were confirmed by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office, said that cellphones used by two of the three teams of assailants had communicated with two numbers at the same location in Belgium during the attacks. The teams included the three gunmen who attacked cafes and bars in eastern Paris as well as another group of gunmen that invaded the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 people died. All of the attackers are dead except for Salah Abdeslam, who has eluded a manhunt centered in Belgium. Several people, however, have yet to be apprehended, and the dots do not yet connect entirely. In addition to Mr. Abdeslam, those still at large include Mohamed Abrini, who appears in video footage with some of the attackers as they travel to France."]
["world/europe", "So far, the Belgian authorities have arrested nine people who have been charged with crimes relating to the November attacks in Paris. But little has been clarified about what role they may have played. The Paris prosecutor also confirmed Wednesday that the police had found that two hours before the attacks began, one of the cars used by the assailants had traveled to the city\u2019s largest international airport, Charles de Gaulle. It stayed for about an hour at Terminal 2C. One of the attackers contacted the phone of someone in the car. It is not clear if someone was dropped off, picked up or neither. Up until now, investigators have said Mr. Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian, was believed to have been the chief planner of the coordinated assaults. He was among three people killed five days later in a raid by the French police in a Paris suburb. But the new information on the cellphone connections appears to have undercut that assumption. No one knows the identity of the person contacted in Belgium, nor the person\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet actually who was the real mastermind of the attack,\u201d said Claude Moniquet, a veteran of France\u2019s intelligence service and now the director of the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center. \u201cIt\u2019s clear it was not Abaaoud and it was probably not a European,\u201d he said, speculating that it could have been someone with ties to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. The group, also known as ISIS and ISIL, claimed responsibility for the attacks less than 24 hours after they were carried out."]

The Islamic State\u2019s ranks include some experienced Iraqi intelligence and military figures who worked for Saddam Hussein and lost their jobs when he was ousted by the United States-led coalition in 2003. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear they had to have commanders on the ground,\u201d Mr. Moniquet said. \u201cWe know that Abaaoud was a commander on the ground,\u201d along with Mr. Abdeslam, who appears to have been less senior but still had some authority. Another possible commander or liaison to the commanders in Iraq or Syria was Charaffe al-Mouadan, who was killed on Dec. 24 by an American airstrike. He was the subject of a conversation among the Bataclan assailants during the attack. One of the survivors said that he had overheard one assailant ask another if they should call Souleymane, the nom de guerre of Mr. Mouadan, and the other replied that he was not going to call him."]
["style", "Review/Fashion; Tough Girls and Cottontails - The New York Times The fashion crowd gathers and regathers each day to inspect the emperors' new clothes, and as of yesterday morning, the midpoint of the spring 2001 collections, there were just two boss designers, Ralph Lauren and Daryl Kerrigan, and they had a lot to say about how women will be dressing. Mr. Lauren cut to the chase by throwing out color. No tulip-time pinks or screaming roadhouse aquas for him. The clothes he showed yesterday in SoHo were all in black and white or brown and white, and the only hint of color that appeared on the runway was the orange in the beads peeking out from the neck of Mr. Lauren's long-sleeve T-shirt as he took his bow. He wore black and white. His family wore black and white. It was Ralph noir. ''I did so much color before, this was the only way to go,'' he said in the postshow crush. And did anyone on his staff raise a doubt? ''Oh, everyone,'' he acknowledged. ''They said, 'What are you doing?' '' The absence of color was not what really set the collection apart. It was the absence of blather, the lack of what might be expressed typographically as ''#####'' -- that is, static. Mr. Lauren took a line with this collection, and stuck to it, sending out lean suits and sleeveless dresses in white leather etched in black; soft, knife-pleated skirts with simple shell tops; a languid V-neck jersey dress with a wide, low-slung cinch belt, and dressy-casual evening separates in lace or chevron-striped silk."]
["style", "In a season crammed with references to this vintage style and that editorial look, Mr. Lauren chose to take himself out of the fray, and the upshot was a collection that, from cut to simplicity of line, needed no excess logic or artificial noise to express what could be said with a clean, clear ''!'' To say that the women in Ms. Kerrigan's superb Daryl K show on Tuesday night looked like gladiators as they came out in raw-looking tunics with leather belts and leggings of sequins and ruching gives not quite the right impression. It implies a male-dominated world, and Ms. Kerrigan is one designer who knows how young women today want to dress -- with feminine wiles but also strength. This came through in a mutton-sleeve denim jacket smocked eccentrically in the back and worn over a hard brown suede mini with a rust petticoat, and in the almost military braids of silver sequins than ran over the sloping shoulders of a pale pink cotton tunic dress. But the attitude was summed up best, perhaps, in a much-gathered top worn by Maggie Rizer over a fierce little skirt of metallic leather. Ms. Kerrigan's feat was to connect the easy girlishness of the 1980's to the mean here-and-now."]

Oh, sure, they'd get to the end of the runway where the photographers were waiting and do the human equivalent of a cherry on top of a sundae -- look tempting -- but they were just being themselves. Before the show, Hillary Alexander, a fashion reporter for The Daily Telegraph of London, confronted a photographer who tried to get some leering shots of the bunnies  as they were dressing. ''I said, 'Look, here,' Ms. Alexander recalled, '' 'We don't do that sort of thing anymore backstage.' '' She laughed. ''He said: 'Listen, I'm the Playboy photographer. This is what we do.' '' And, in a way, Ms. Johnson understood that. She put them in naughty nighties, cute little bustiers over flouncy skirts and in such all-girl favorites as sundresses and sheaths.

They had subjects listen to manipulated male and female voices saying, \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November.\u201d The subjects then participated in a mock election. They found that both men and women picked candidates with lower-pitched voices. In the final week before the Iowa caucuses, candidates are making a mad dash to prove themselves the best option. They have six days to call voters, knock on doors and generally make their case before the first actual decision of Decision 2016 is made. But this down-to-the-wire effort to share policy proposals and paint their opponents as establishment shills or unelectable wacko birds probably matters less than candidates hope."]
["opinion/campaign-stops", "Often, seemingly superficial characteristics and split-second judgments can affect voters\u2019 decisions. Another study found that most American presidents are taller than average, and that voters tend to choose taller candidates. In the general election, the taller of the two candidates won roughly two-thirds of the time. A 2005 study by the psychologist Alexander Todorov presented participants with photos of two congressional candidates, and asked them to choose which one looked more competent. More than two-thirds of the time, participants were able to pick the winner of each Congressional race just by how \u201ccompetent\u201d he or she looked. The keys to looking competent? A square jaw, an intense stare \u2014 in other words, not too far from Donald J. Trump on the cover of Time. There is also a well-documented primacy effect in voting: Candidates who are listed first on the ballot have been found to get 2.3 percent more votes on average than when they are listed farther down on the ballot. Having a familiar-sounding name has also been found to help candidates\u2019 electoral success. In Cook County, Illinois \u2014 home to Chicago, a city with the second-largest Irish-American population in the country \u2014 Irish-sounding last names have been thought to help candidates so much that in 2005, a candidate for Cook County judge legally switched from Frederick S. Rhine to Patrick Michael O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt seemed like a very voter-friendly name,\u201d he said at the time. (So far it seems unlikely that the Irish Name Effect will pay off for one Martin O\u2019Malley, any more than it did for the new Mr. O\u2019Brien, who dropped out of his race.)"]
["opinion/campaign-stops", "What accounts for all this superficial reasoning? It comes down to something called decision heuristics, or mental shortcuts. As humans, we need to use our brain power efficiently. We do that by reducing the amount of effort we spend assessing each interaction, decision or task. Heuristics help us process the boatloads of information that we take in every day. As a result, we make decisions not by arduously ticking off a list of pros and cons, but by assessing the information, or cues, that are most readily available. Some of these shortcuts can be built up over the thousands of daily encounters we\u2019ve had. For example, I tend to distrust people who unironically use the word \u201csynergy.\u201d It just makes life easier. Of course, there are instances when our own mental shortcuts and preconceptions distort the truth, and that is where our cognitive biases arise. The vocal pitch preference that Mr. Klofstad studies, for one, is pretty outdated. While voice pitch may be a sound proxy for figuring out which candidate may have the most testosterone, that doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to being a better leader. \u201cIn human history, politics was about physical contact, fighting with rocks and sticks,\u201d Mr. Klofstad said. \u201cNowadays, war still matters, but our political battles are about ideologies and not physical conflicts.\u201d"]
["opinion/campaign-stops", "Another example of this sort of cognitive bias is something called the \u201cthird person effect,\u201d according to David Greenberg, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University and the author of \u201cRepublic of Spin.\u201d Because we like to protect our own egos, we tend to not worry about our own susceptibility to biased judgment, while worrying about others\u2019 lack of savviness. That is to say, we only think other people\u2019s biases are a problem. Daniel Oppenheimer, a psychology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author of \u201cDemocracy Despite Itself,\u201d said there are \u201cthree I\u2019s\u201d that unite voters: ignorance, irrationality and incompetence. He says that as voters, we don\u2019t reflect on our own core beliefs and then seek out the candidate who best matches them. Instead, it\u2019s usually quite the opposite: We decide which candidate we like based on subjective cues, then mold our beliefs to fit theirs. \u201cMost people have no idea where most candidates stand on most issues, so they just assume that the candidate agrees with them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will actually change their position to align with the candidates they prefer, and will also assume that candidates agree with them on important issues, even when that isn\u2019t true.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say that shortcuts in decision making are necessarily bad; they are often good. It\u2019s evolutionarily beneficial for humans to be able to process a lot of information without shutting down. \u201cHeuristics are usually very helpful. We wouldn\u2019t use them if they weren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that sometimes they\u2019re not.\u201d"]

Aside from celebrities, there is no one who is more conscious of his or her own subconscious signals, vocal and visual cues than a presidential candidate. Even politicians who appear messy or unscripted to the layman\u2019s eye are most likely calculating how to appear that way to voters. Remember when Senator Marco Rubio was spotted wearing shiny, high-heeled boots while campaigning in New Hampshire? Since then, Mr. Rubio has been upping his machismo on the trail.

It\u2019s unreasonable to expect every single voter in America to sit down and thoughtfully digest each candidates\u2019 policy proposals. \u201cIt\u2019s simply silly to think that every single citizen is going to get up to speed on the differences between Medicare expansion and single-payer health care,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cIndividuals shouldn\u2019t be held to a standard of being public policy students. That\u2019s just not realistic. That\u2019s not how people live their lives.\u201d What we can do is try to consciously push back against some of our baser instincts. When you decide to vote for a candidate, ask yourself: Why do I like this person? What does he or she represent that I agree with? Instead of trying to deny our innate superficiality, maybe we should try to embrace it. After all, we\u2019re only human."]
["fashion", "Justin Trudeau Takes an Image, and Wins With It - The New York Times So Canada has a new prime minister. On Monday, Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, became the second-youngest head of government in Canada\u2019s history, marking the end of almost 10 years of Stephen Harper and Conservative dominion, and trouncing the third party candidate, Thomas Mulcair of the New Democratic Party. Though lasting only 11 weeks, this campaign was one of Canada\u2019s longest, and reports on the new era have posited it as a referendum on climate change and the economy; on immigration and the niqab. But largely overlooked in all the analysis has been the issue, which played a surprisingly large part in the various bids for office, of hair. This is not a joke. And it is not a frivolous observation. Dismiss it as north of the border tomfoolery and miss a trick. Hair has not played such a big part in a political contest as far back as I can remember. It puts the flurry of conversation around Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s do-switcheroos, John Edwards\u2019s $400 cut and Mitt Romney\u2019s crowning glory in the shade. And it suggests that, like it or not, in a social media world where humor and pictures have a very real power, successful candidates need to be clever enough to use them strategically, lest they be used by others against them. Each candidate\u2019s hair had its own (unofficial) Twitter account, and Mr. Mulcair\u2019s beard had two: @TrudeausHair, @GrayBouffant (for Mr. Harper), @MulcairBeard and @Mulcairsbeard (the latter has more followers)."]
["fashion", "Hill & Knowlton Strategies in Canada even created a special set of election emoji that used hair to stand in for each of the candidates. As of Election Day, they had been downloaded 54,894 times, according to Sarah Brandon, the vice president for corporate development. \u201cEach of the candidates had a very distinct look,\u201d Ms. Brandon said, explaining why Hill & Knowlton chose hair as communications semiology. \u201cAs soon as you saw the hair, you knew exactly which leader was being referenced.\u201d Indeed, as much as anything over the last 78 days, hair came to stand for each candidate: Mr. Trudeau, called \u201chair apparent\u201d by the Economist in acknowledgment of the legacy of his father, the former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, as well as his lush brown curls; Stephen Harper, a.k.a. \u201cLego hair,\u201d thanks to his side-parted and immobile resemblance to the all-in-one toppers of the little plastic people; and Mr. Mulcair and his beard, itself an anomaly in a country that has not elected a bearded prime minister since 1896, when Mackenzie Bowell resigned. There\u2019s a lesson here to be learned. It starts back in May. That was when Mr. Harper (who resigned his post after the Liberals\u2019 decisive victory) used Mr. Trudeau\u2019s hair as a small jab at the potential threat, releasing an ad called \u201cThe interview\u201d that suggested, in various not-so-subtle ways, that the Liberal leader was not yet seasoned enough to guide the country, though he did have \u201cnice hair.\u201d The aim: to plant the seed that he was a lightweight pretty boy."]

Although Mr. Trudeau initially tried to rise above the hair thing, announcing (in response to the Conservative ad), \u201cI won\u2019t be talking about beards or hair,\u201d the New Democratic Party took the dare on its chin, releasing its own ad overtly satirizing the Conservative ad, with the same hair tagline applied to Mr. Harper. There was even a host of memorabilia created around Mr. Mulcair\u2019s beard, including N.D.P. orange buttons with the slogan \u201dbeard a part of it\u201d and posters with the slogan, \u201cI\u2019m voting for the beard.\u201d In the end, there was so much hair discussion that even the writer Margaret Atwood felt compelled to weigh in with a satirical op-ed piece in the National Post in August pointing out that Mr. Harper travels with a personal stylist and that maybe he shouldn\u2019t open that particular can of hair gel. Though the column was quickly taken down by the website, reportedly for \u201cfact checking\u201d reasons, it served only to make the hair discussion even more prominent \u2014 partly thanks to a tweet from Ms. Atwood. The column was later reinstated in slightly edited form, but not before it spawned its own hashtag: #hairgate."]
["fashion", "Mr. Trudeau, meanwhile, sensed the opportunity in the Atwood situation, tweeting, \u201cwhile we\u2019re all on the subject of hair, a reminder of what really matters\u201d and releasing his own video with some nice script noting that Mr. Harper \u201ccan\u2019t stop talking about Justin Trudeau\u2019s hair,\u201d but that he, Mr. Trudeau, had other things to talk about. Like the middle class. In other words, he took the weapon and used it to his own ends, instead of simply ignoring it because it was too superficial. The hair hoo-ha culminated last weekend, two days before Election Day, when the Liberals released a pretty catchy cartoon entitled \u201cYour Guide to Canadian Political Hair,\u201d which used the morphing hairstyles of the candidates to suggest that 1. no matter what \u2019do Mr. Trudeau sported, it didn\u2019t change the potential of his policies; and that 2. no matter the hair, there was little difference between Mr. Mulcair and Mr. Harper. Ridiculous? A distraction from the real subjects? Or a smart and humorous way to push the identification levers currently available via imagery and optics (Who doesn\u2019t have hair issues? Who can\u2019t relate to these stereotypes?) to create an instant narrative, one of alternative options, youth and difference? I, and apparently the majority of the Canadian electorate, reach the latter conclusion. It\u2019s a strategy also shared, it\u2019s worth pointing out, by Mrs. Clinton, who has managed to outwit her critics by making jokes out of her own image history and preferences, whether by noting that she won\u2019t go gray in the White House because \u201cI\u2019ve been coloring my hair for years,\u201d or posting her first Instagram picture ever of a rack of pantsuits with the caption \u201chard choices.\u201d"]

On Monday, The Telegraph broke the news that James Woolhouse, the Cond\u00e9 Nast International executive vice president, had sent a memo to select staff saying that the company would no longer be working with the \u201ccontroversial\u201d fashion photographer. \u201cAny shoots that have been commissioned or any shoots that have been completed but not yet published should be killed and substituted with other material,\u201d the memo said. The next day, Cond\u00e9 Nast International\u2019s American sister organization released a statement saying: \u201cCond\u00e9 Nast has nothing planned with Terry Richardson going forward. Sexual harassment of any kind is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.\u201d Porter, the Net-a-Porter magazine, also said it was no longer working with Mr. Richardson. So did Hearst magazines, which owns Elle, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Esquire and Marie Claire. Mr. Richardson had already been commissioned to shoot the January cover of Elle and had recently done so. It is now being redone by another photographer. Bulgari, Diesel and Valentino, all brands that recently worked with Mr. Richardson on their ad campaigns, issued statements stating that they had no plans to work with him in the future."]
["style", "It all sounds very responsible. But some industry insiders have begun to question whether fashion\u2019s efforts to distance itself from Mr. Richardson is an attempt to Band-Aid over a deeper crisis, to make a public example of an offender already accused in order to appear to be taking action, when a much broader and more systemic approach needs to be adopted. Edie Campbell, a model who has been featured in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, among others, said: \u201cThe reality is that the floodgates are already open regarding Terry Richardson. He\u2019s been blacklisted once before, and it\u2019s not that much of an emotional, psychological or commercial leap to blacklist him again. The difficulty is addressing the other people \u2014 the ones who are celebrated by the fashion industry, and who are still at the very heart of it. This will not be solved simply by banning the use of one photographer.\u201d While there are many creative and morally reputable professionals in the industry, it is also rife with reports of lines being crossed. \u201cThe problem is much larger than Terry, who has become the scapegoat, and the quickest means for this industry to absolve itself from any responsibility,\u201d said David Bonnouvrier, the co-founder of DNA Models. Katie Grand, the editor of Love magazine and a stylist who works with brands including Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu, and who earlier this week reposted a statement from Ms. Campbell on Instagram to the same effect, wrote in an email: \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m defending him, but I thought it was important to put into perspective that every model has a story of a photographer, client, art director, stylist behaving inappropriately.\u201d"]
["style", "Mr. Richardson was widely pilloried in 2014 when allegations of behavior that included cavorting naked on shoots and forcing his penis on models surfaced in the news media. Mr. Richardson has not denied his behavior but has always maintained that any sexual activity was consensual, and no criminal charges were ever filed. No major new allegations have appeared since 2014, and he had reportedly gone through therapy. He recently had twins and got married. Numerous magazines cut ties with Mr. Richardson around 2014, though he had gradually returned to the industry, working with celebrities including Miley Cyrus and Beyonc\u00e9 as well as magazines and brands. When Roberta Myers was the editor of Elle (she recently stepped down), she had forbidden the magazine to work with Mr. Richardson, but after Nina Garcia was appointed as Elle\u2019s new editor, he was commissioned to photograph the actress Zo\u00eb Kravitz for the January 2018 cover. After The New York Times published its account detailing allegations of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual harassment and abuse, Joanna Coles, the chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, and Ms. Garcia decided to cancel the Elle cover photographed by Mr. Richardson and to reshoot it, a Hearst spokeswoman confirmed. American Vogue stopped working with Mr. Richardson in 2010, when the first public statements about his behavior appeared, but in the last two years he had done shoots for Vogue China, Vogue France, Korean W, German GQ and Italian GQ, among others. Recently he shot a story for the November issue of W, a Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine, for the first time since 2011.

Editors were on set during the shoot and also handled the model casting. In the wake of the current revelations about the behavior of men in power, including Bill O\u2019Reilly and Leon Wieseltier, however, Mr. Richardson\u2019s past behavior once again made news. The Sunday Times of London revisited the story (the day before Cond\u00e9 Nast International sent its memo). A petition was started on Change.org asking magazines and other brands to stop using Mr. Richardson; it has over 42,000 signatures. The designer Prabal Gurung posted on Instagram: \u201cIt is important that we hold everyone accountable who worked with Terry Richardson. Not to shame them, but to understand the intention & motive behind their decision to turn a blind eye to his horrific actions. Clearly they cannot say they didn\u2019t know, because we all knew.\u201d The question now becomes: What else does fashion know? Trish Goff, a former top model who has spoken about her experience with Mr. Weinstein, said that during her modeling years, \u201cthere were other girls and agents who would warn you about a photographer.

Extreme fire behavior \u2014 difficult to predict and dangerous to fight \u2014 has been the watchword of the 2017 season across the West. More large, uncontrolled wildfires were burning in 10 Western states in early September than at any comparable time since 2006. And those fires have leaned in, menacing more lives and property, by their size and their proximity, than in any recent season. Two firefighters died in Montana, and dozens of buildings and homes have been destroyed in California. About 150 hikers had to be rescued in Oregon when a fire encircled them. Evacuation orders \u2014 residents told to be ready to flee at a moment\u2019s notice \u2014 reached to within 15 miles of downtown Portland.

It was raining fire, or close to it, they said. Small sticks and pine cones, smoking and still too hot to touch, were landing around them, whirled there by winds blasting from the Eagle Creek fire just to the east near Multnomah Falls, a place that has not seen a major wildfire in living memory. Then, as they looked toward the Cascade Range slopes that rise steeply from the river, they saw the fire surge toward them through the Douglas fir, cedar and hemlock. \u201cI looked at her and she said, \u2018Go now,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Brown, 74, a retired truck assembly worker, describing the scramble of their escape. \u201cScariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ms. Brown added, standing alongside her husband in an evacuation camp across the river in Washington. From California to Utah and Montana, thousands of others have also been forced to flee, and evacuation orders were still in place late last week for 23 active fires in four states, with nearly 21,000 firefighters in the field across the region. Still, at least so far, the year is not a record, with 8.3 million acres burned as of mid-September. More than 10 million acres burned in 2015, the worst fire season in decades.

Visiting college football coaches have worried about how the smoke might affect the performances of their players. Changes in forest management have also fanned the flames, specialists say. Many areas of the West \u2014 where timber cutting has declined and even the thinning of trees for fire safety is sometimes contested by conservation groups \u2014 are choked with younger smaller trees that can burn readily, patches of thick undergrowth or blighted areas where insects or disease have left dead trees standing in place."]

Early models of the fire season said that last winter\u2019s big mountain snows, which lasted deep into summer in higher elevations, would probably keep many places damp. But then a severe heat wave settled in over a vast area from Montana to Northern California and across the Pacific Northwest, and some places went more than 100 days with no measurable rainfall. Most of Montana is suffering an extended drought.

Even though the 500 is one of the Italian automaker\u2019s most popular models, demand is so weak that the plant will produce only 300,000 vehicles next year, half as many as in 2009, Fiat said."]
["business/global", "Slumping car production was the main reason for a 0.7 percent decline in French factory output in October compared to September, analysts at Barclays Capital said Monday in a note to clients. Peugeot has announced plans to close a plant near Paris, but has run into stiff opposition from unions and the French government. In 2008, when the auto industry downturn began, many countries including Germany and France offered tax credits or other incentives to encourage people to trade in old cars for new ones. But those stimulus measures merely postponed a reckoning with overcapacity that predated the financial crisis. European governments, which are focused on reducing debt, have shown no inclination to bail out Opel or other automakers. Georg Streiter, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, offered only words of sympathy on Monday. \u201cThe chancellor and the government regret this decision,\u201d Mr. Streiter told reporters in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s a severe blow that affects a lot of people and their families and the Bochum region as well.\u201d Mr. Streiter gave no indication, however, that the German government would intervene, saying only that he expected \u201cthat the parent company General Motors will do everything possible to find socially acceptable solutions\u201d regarding the future of the employees. The crisis has had much less effect on makers of German luxury cars, but their immunity seems to be wearing off.

The end of car production at the Bochum plant was no surprise after Opel said in July that it would not produce the next generation of the Zafira Tourer minivan there when the current model\u2019s life cycle ends. The Zafira, which shares many parts with the Chevrolet Orlando, is the main model produced in Bochum. Workers had hoped they would be able to persuade G.M. to produce another model at Bochum, but the automaker ruled that out on Monday. Emotions were high at a meeting Monday morning in Bochum at which employees learned of the decision. Spiegel Online and other German media reported that security guards had to restrain a union official who tried to prevent an Opel executive from leaving the gathering. An Opel spokesman, Ulrich Weber, confirmed there had been an incident but said it was not serious. Opel had serious problems before the crisis. It has lost market share to rivals like Volkswagen and has not made a profit in Europe in more than a decade. Opel\u2019s share of the European Union market was 6 percent in October, down from 6.6 percent a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. Sales of Opel brand cars were off 15 percent in the first 10 months of 2012 from a year earlier."]

Ms. Berman was shot once in the back of the head in her Benedict Canyon home shortly after Mr. Durst said she told him that the authorities in New York wanted to talk to her about what happened to his wife. Mr. Durst, 73, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace, appeared before Judge Mark Windham in Los Angeles County Superior Court and entered a plea of not guilty. He had orange prison slippers on his feet. Answeringa procedural question from the judge, Mr. Durst said in a hoarse, low voice: \u201cI am not guilty.

Suspicions have surrounded Mr. Durst since 1982, when his first wife, Kathleen Durst, disappeared from the couple\u2019s stone cottage in Westchester County, N.Y. His friends and relatives believed that Mr. Durst, a member of the wealthy real estate family that runs the Durst Organization, was involved. He was never charged in connection with the case. Mr. Durst met Ms. Berman during the late 1960s at the University of California, Los Angeles, where they were students. Friends say there was an immediate bond. They came from wealthy families and had lost their mothers at a young age, possibly to suicide. Ms. Berman, the daughter of Davie Berman, a mobster who was a partner in Bugsy Siegel\u2019s Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, became a journalist and a screenwriter. \u201cWe became fast friends,\u201d Mr. Durst said during courtroom testimony in Galveston, Tex. \u201cWe were never boyfriend and girlfriend.\u201d Mr. Durst counted on Ms. Berman to shield him from the press when his wife\u2019s sudden disappearance generated tabloid headlines in New York.

But it was Mr. Durst\u2019s own hubris that brought his freewheeling ways to an end. Beginning in 2010, he agreed to participate in the documentary \u2014 \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\u201d \u2014 about his life and the murder allegations, which was eventually broadcast on HBO in February and March 2015.

The makers of \u201cThe Jinx\u201d obtained a letter he wrote to her in which the lettering of the address on the envelope appears identical to that of the \u201ccadaver\u201d note, down to the misspelling of Beverly Hills as \u201cBeverley.\u201d In 2001, when Mr. Durst was living in Texas, body parts of his elderly neighbor were found floating in Galveston Bay, and Mr. Durst was charged with his murder.

But all of that is likely to be the subject of fierce litigation before trial, as the defense moves to exclude the material. Mr. DeGuerin has described \u201cThe Jinx\u201d as a \u201csensationalized docudrama.\u201d Mr. Durst has also told falsehoods over the years, which could cast doubt over both his protestations of innocence and his damaging admissions.

Blount, who was suspended Friday for the rest of the season, apologized. \u201cI just kind of lost my head,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cA couple of players started pushing, and that\u2019s when I lost my head. I lost my temper. I apologize.\u201d Throughout August, the scandals trickled in. Rick Pitino, the coach of the men\u2019s basketball team at Louisville, admitted to having a sexual encounter in a restaurant with a woman whom he later gave $3,000 once she told him she was pregnant. The N.C.A.A. announced it was stripping the Memphis men\u2019s basketball team of its trip to the 2008 Final Four after investigators concluded a player had competed while academically ineligible. And there was Rich Rodriguez, the Michigan football coach, who is attempting to rebuild the Wolverines\u2019 program while facing an investigation into whether he exceeded limits on practice times. As the Oregon-Boise State game got under way Thursday, the opposing players shook hands as part of a pregame sportsmanship initiative, and it seemed the focus was back on the game itself. But as ESPN, which televised the game live, replayed clips of the Blount punch throughout the day Friday, the incident renewed debate over the price of success in high-stakes college sports."]

And in 2003, Ohio state linebacker Robert Reynolds was suspended for a game after choking a Wisconsin quarterback during a game. Wally Renfro, the senior adviser to the N.C.A.A.\u2019s president, Myles Brand, cautioned against condemning all of intercollegiate athletics because of the actions of a few. \u201cYou wish these things didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Renfro said. \u201cBut I think it says more about the foibles of human beings than it does about the character of intercollegiate athletics.\u201d"]

The proposed deal is the second time  the two companies have tried to get together. The first, a merger plan in 2011, was blocked by the commission on antitrust concerns. The outcome this time will be an indication of how far the E.U. competition regulator is prepared to adapt its policies to the harsh economic realities of recession-battered southern Europe. In February, the commission also rejected a proposed merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus in Ireland, another country ravaged by an economic collapse following the 2008 financial market crisis. Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air say that the merger offers their only hope of survival. If the commission rules against them, they say, they have no Plan B. \u201cI was asking politicians what they do after they lose an election,\u201d Eftichios Vassilakis, executive vice chairman of Aegean Airlines said during an earnings call in April. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to lose the election.

In response, Aegean has offered several concessions, including giving away some slots and agreeing to freeze fares."]
["business/global", "Aegean also says that the merged company would account for only about 30 percent of domestic air traffic in Greece.

The European Commission is expected to give its decision Sept. 3, but because of the composition of the companies\u2019 fleets, there has already been a natural split in the market that allows the two carriers to act less as competitors. Aegean has a larger fleet and bigger aircraft suitable for international flights, while Olympic\u2019s fleet, mostly composed of turbo props, is geared to shorter flights, the two airlines say. Greece and Ireland, in many ways the poster children for the European economic crisis, are not alone in exploring airline mergers. Europe\u2019s market has undergone a flurry of consolidation over the past few years, with Lufthansa merging with Austrian Airlines, and KLM with Air France. What distinguishes the Olympic-Aegean deal, much like Aer Lingus and Ryanair, is that the two carriers operate in the same domestic market."]
["business/global", "For some, the fact that Europe is in its fifth year of economic crisis justifies a loosening of E.U. restrictions on competition law to give struggling airlines a chance to survive. \u201cGiven the state of the Greek economy and the importance of inbound tourism,\u201d said John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting in London, \u201ccompetition between two home carriers is currently something of a luxury.\u201d Some competition economists say that it would be odd if the Aegean and Olympic deal were to go through after the Ryanair and Aer Lingus proposal was blocked. But George Koulouris, deputy chief executive officer of Marfin Investment Group, the parent company of Olympic Air, says that the two merger proposals are very different. \u201cThere are no similarities of size and nature of the market,\u201d Mr. Koulouris said in an interview last week. In the Irish case, \u201cboth airlines are a lot larger\u201d than the Greek carriers, he noted. In Ireland, moreover, \u201cthere are barriers to enter the market,\u201d he said: \u201cIn Greece there are no slot restrictions.\u201d If Aegean and Olympic were to merge, the combined airline would be much smaller than a joint Ryanair-Aer Lingus carrier, and the combined Greek airline would represent 16 percent of international flights in and out of Greece. If Aer Lingus and Ryanair were to merge, the joint airline would account for 83 percent of flights in and out of Ireland, Mr. Koulouris said."]

["business/global", "Regional Carriers Finding Larger Planes More Economical - The New York Times NEW YORK \u2014 When Delta Air Lines took over a regional carrier, Pinnacle Airlines, last month, it was the latest example of changing dynamics in the U.S. regional airline industry: As consolidation continues, network carriers are exerting ever more control over their regional partners. Last year, Delta provided the financially strapped Pinnacle, then based in Memphis, Tennessee \u2014 and now in Minneapolis \u2014 with $74.3 million in financing and agreed to strengthen its fleet with fuel-efficient, 76-seat Bombardier CRJ-900 NextGen large regional jets \u2014 on the condition that Pinnacle slash its labor costs. After Pinnacle filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and negotiated new labor agreements, Delta agreed to invest another $52 million when it emerged from bankruptcy \u2014 which it did, May 1 \u2014 and to further expand Pinnacle\u2019s fleet of large regional jets to replace its older 50-seat aircraft. Commenting in April on the Pinnacle deal, Delta\u2019s chief executive, Richard Anderson, said it would bring Delta \u201ca very significant competitive advantage\u201d in the regional market. The deal fits into a plan for Delta, which itself emerged from bankruptcy in 2007, to cut its legacy fleet of 50-seat planes to 125 from about 350, replacing them with larger, fuel-efficient aircraft. United is another network carrier that is shifting up from 50-seat regional planes; since April, it has announced the purchase of 70 Embraer 175 aircraft, which seat 70 to 80 passengers."]
["business/global", "\u201cThe increase in jet fuel prices since 2000 has undermined the operating economics of the 50-seat and smaller regional jets, the predominant aircraft type used by U.S. regionals,\u201d said Daniel M. Kasper, a senior consultant to Compass Lexecon, which has been involved in restructuring U.S. airlines. \u201cAt the same time, the restructuring of large network airlines in bankruptcy over the past decade has forced them to focus much more on reducing costs wherever possible, which included squeezing the margins paid to their regional airline affiliates,\u201d he added. That squeeze is likely to get tighter. \u201cAs existing contracts between regional airlines and network carriers expire in the coming years, the network airlines have the flexibility to change regional carriers, with the lowest cost regional carriers the likely winners,\u201d said Michael Derchin, senior airline analyst for CRT Capital Group. \u201cThis favors regionals that have gone through bankruptcy and negotiated the most competitive contracts,\u201d like Pinnacle, he said. Mr. Derchin and Mr. Kasper both said they expected the merger of US Airways and AMR, American Airlines\u2019 parent company, formally announced in February, to lead to a restructuring of their combined regional airline networks. Henry Harteveldt, analyst for Hudson Crossing, a travel consulting company, said a key question in such a restructuring would be whether to go ahead with a long-considered spinoff of American Eagle, American\u2019s regional operation, or \u201ckeep it as a business unit and look for ways to make it more cost-effective.\u201d"]

Instead, the dominant conference topic was about an issue that has dogged the industry for decades: sexism in the workplace. And two of advertising\u2019s most powerful men found themselves on opposite sides in their assessments of how big the problem continues to be. Two weeks ago, the chief communications officer for the J. Walter Thompson agency filed a lawsuit accusing its chief executive of sexist and racist behaviors, raising new questions about gender discrimination and diversity in the industry. When asked about the lawsuit during a discussion on Tuesday, Maurice Levy, the head of the industry giant Publicis, said the accusations in the lawsuit were \u201ca one-man mistake\u201d and not indicative of a wider problem. On Wednesday, however, Martin Sorrell of WPP, which owns J. Walter Thompson, sounded a much different note. \u201cThere is a problem,\u201d Mr. Sorrell said by video conference. \u201cMaurice has a habit of ignoring the facts,\u201d he added when asked about Mr. Levy\u2019s comments.

And it happens more frequently than we think,\u201d she added. While there are more women in advertising than in previous decades, including some in the executive ranks, the industry is still dominated by white men. There has been talk within advertising for years about improving gender and racial diversity.

She said men called her \u201c \u2018young girl\u2019 all the time\u201d even though she has been working in advertising since the 1980s.

Andrew M. Cuomo has entered the final four months of his re-election campaign with an enormous monetary advantage, according to state financial disclosures released on Tuesday. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has proved himself as an adept fund-raiser, having begun the year with $33 million on hand. And Tuesday\u2019s disclosures to the State Board of Elections reaffirmed his drawing power for contributors: In the past six months, Mr. Cuomo has raised $8.5 million, while spending nearly $6.8 million, leaving the incumbent $35 million to spend. By contrast, Rob Astorino, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Republican opponent, has $2.4 million on hand. Recent polls have shown the governor riding a large lead over Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive. A survey released in mid-June by Siena College found that a majority of voters had no opinion of Mr. Astorino and little knowledge of his positions. Mr. Cuomo himself has paid little attention to his Republican challenger, but has continued to raise funds, including an event last week in Skaneateles that piggybacked on a state function in nearby Syracuse. Mr. Cuomo spent some $28 million during his campaign in 2010, according to government watchdog groups, when he easily bested Carl P. Paladino, a sharp-tongued real estate developer who had hoped to ride the Tea Party\u2019s backing to victory. Mr. Astorino, a former radio producer, is considered a more moderate candidate, but has not been able to tap large reservoirs of cash that were available to Mr. Paladino, a millionaire."]

Burkle, the grocery store billionaire; and $25,000 from James L. Dolan, the chief executive of Cablevision. He also got $60,800 from Stanley Druckenmiller, a charter school backer and former hedge manager, on March 4, the day the governor spoke at a pro-charter rally in Albany.

["nyregion", "No Room on a Bike Rack? Not a Problem for These Smart Bikes - The New York Times It promised a new way of bike riding in New York City \u2014 GPS-tracked smart bikes that would rent for as little as $1 and did not have to be picked up or returned to fixed locations. But before it could even start, the company that operates the bikes, Spin, canceled a demonstration project in the Rockaways in Queens after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from city transportation officials. A news conference to welcome the neon-orange Spin bikes instead became a rally to bring them to the beachside community complete with ceremonial rides along the boardwalk. Spin\u2019s unsuccessful effort comes as a new generation of tech-savvy bike companies are vying to make riding less expensive and more convenient, competing with more established bike-share programs in the process. Instead of heading to a docking station full of bikes, riders tap a mobile app to locate the closest bicycle left by a previous rider on a street or sidewalk, or in another public space. They typically scan a code on the bikes or punch in numbers to unlock the rear wheels. Once riders get where they are going, they find a place to park the bike, and lock the wheels again to deter theft."]
["nyregion", "These so-called \u201cdockless bike\u201d programs aim to let customers ride on their own terms, and are similar to the flexible car-sharing program car2go, which allows drivers to leave cars where they can find on-street parking within an operating area. The dockless bikes can be rolled out more quickly and easily than bike-share systems that rely on a network of docking stations, which are expensive to build and take up valuable street and parking space. In Dallas, which had struggled for years to fund a bike-share system, there are now about 300 dockless bikes. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling it \u2018Bike Share 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lee M. Kleinman, a Dallas City Councilman. \u201cBy dragging our feet, we ended up with the latest and greatest flavor of bike share instead of the legacy docking systems.\u201d In New York, the idea of free-floating bikes also appeals to many riders who say they may have to go out of their way to get to a docking station or ride from one station to another trying to return a bike because all the parking slots are full. \u201cMany times I\u2019ve searched for a dock,\u201d said Joe Flanagan, 56, a financial worker, as he claimed the last available spot in a Citi Bike station in Lower Manhattan. \u201cI\u2019m surprised I found one down here.\u201d Spin\u2019s price is another draw: $1 for every 30 minutes. Citi Bike, which is New York City\u2019s bike-share program, does not offer a single-ride price, but instead has a $12 one-day pass, which includes an unlimited number of 30 minute rides."]
["nyregion", "But many city officials and transportation advocates contend that dockless systems are still unproven, and that piecemeal efforts by what some have called \u201crogue bike-share companies\u201d have been done with flimsy equipment and little coordination or oversight. New York City transportation officials said they did not know about Spin\u2019s demonstration until a few days beforehand. \u201cAs much as we want to embrace new technology, it has to be done in a safe and orderly way,\u201d said Polly Trottenberg, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be the Wild West.\u201d Dockless bike-share systems have been tried in other countries with mixed results.

Spin has more than 2,500 bikes in four cities, including Seattle and Dallas, and employs a ground crew to maintain the bikes, which are equipped with a solar panel to power the rear wheel locks and high density foam tires to withstand punctures."]
["nyregion", "His company, Mr. Ko said, has received more requests for bikes than complaints. \u201cEvery city is getting so crowded so the more transportation options, the better,\u201d Mr. Ko said. \u201cWe are complementing the existing transportation infrastructure.\u201d Some cities have taken steps to try to head off any problems. Dallas has updated an information hotline to route any complaints about the bikes directly to the companies, Mr. Kleinman said. And Downtown Dallas, a nonprofit group, has pledged to install 150 bike racks during the next two years to serve as handy resting spots for the dockless bikes. San Francisco, which has a dock-based, bike-share program that is being expanded, has created a permit application for \u201cstationless bikes\u201d that requires companies to ensure that their bikes meet safety standards and are accessible to everyone, especially in disadvantaged communities. Seattle turned to dockless bikes in July after ending a 2014 dock-based program, Pronto, that had failed to attract many riders. Scott Kubly, the city\u2019s transportation director, said the city had considered spending $5 million to expand Pronto but decided instead to put that money toward more bike routes and infrastructure, and invite companies to bring in dockless bikes through a new permit process that requires the bikes to be parked on sidewalks away from foot traffic, alongside benches and planters."]

There have been local media reports that some are being \u201cparked irresponsibly.\u201d In New York, interest in Spin\u2019s dockless bikes has been fueled by gaps in the city\u2019s bike-share program. About 10,000 Citi Bikes are deployed from docking stations concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with some stations in Queens and none in the Bronx and Staten Island, leading to charges of inequity and favoritism by some local officials and residents. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to serve our district, and someone else wants to, I welcome them with open arms,\u201d said Eric A. Ulrich, a Queens councilman who has tried to get Citi Bikes stationed in the Rockaways. Mr. Ko said that Spin was still interested in bringing bikes to New York, and would continue to work with city transportation officials. Motivate, the company that operates Citi Bike, has said it wants to expand to all five boroughs and is seeking city approval to do so. Ms. Trottenberg said that while the city was committed to expanding Citi Bike, it also has to consider other factors such as making sure there is adequate and safe bike infrastructure to support increasing ridership.

["science", "3 Men Vital to the Internet Share Nobel Prize in Physics - The New York Times Citing the worldwide impact of the Internet enabled by their work, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics to three scientists who developed electrical components that allow for fast communication using fiber optics and satellites and that serve as the soul of the personal computer. The emphasis on applied rather than basic science represents a sharp departure by the Swedish Academy, which has for decades favored abstract breakthroughs like the discovery of new subatomic particles or the creation of unusual states of matter, said scientists both inside and outside the academy. Half of this year's prize money, which totals 9 million kronor or about $913,000, will go to Jack S. Kilby, a 76-year-old retired engineer for Texas Instruments in Dallas, for his part in the invention of the integrated circuit, the miniaturized electronic chip that drives computers. The other half is to be split by Dr. Zhores I. Alferov, the director of the A. F. Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Dr. Herbert Kroemer, a physicist and professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Dr. Alferov, who is 70, and Dr. Kroemer, who is 72, were cited for independently developing electronic components called heterostructures that turned small, solid-state lasers into practical devices and greatly accelerated communications circuitry. The lasers are used in compact-disc players, bar-code readers and fiber optics; the circuitry is important in the operation of cell phones and satellite communications."]
["science", "First conceived in the late 1950's and early 1960's, the heterostructures, involving what were then novel materials, had their biggest impact on small lasers, Dr. Kroemer said. ''It was a question of making something possible that without heterostructures simply couldn't have been done at all.'' Without the structures, he added, ''there would be no CD players and no CD's.'' Creating integrated circuits required building numerous electrical components like transistors from a single block of material, rather than assembling them with wires and other components. Integrated circuits have continued to shrink since Mr. Kilby built some of the first ones in 1958; he said that ''the process has been refined to a degree that would have seemed unbelievable.'' Mr. Kilby was involved in a long and complex patent fight with Dr. Robert N. Noyce, who built an integrated circuit at about the same time and later helped found the Intel Corporation. Many scientists said that if Dr. Noyce, who died in 1990, were still alive, he would have shared a prize with Mr. Kilby. The focus on what some physicists regard as engineering rather than pure science sparked widely differing reactions among scientists. Unlike the particle discoveries oftenhonored by the Nobels, said Dr. Carver Mead, an emeritus professor of engineering and applied science at the California Institute of Technology, ''Each of these innovations has made the world a much better place and changed a lot of people's lives. So I think it's about time we got centered back on the stuff that really matters to real people.''"]
["science", "But Dr. Michael Riordan, a physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the co-author of ''Crystal Fire'' (W. W. Norton), a history of the transistor, called the integrated circuit ''an engineering feat, not a scientific one,'' involving a rearrangement of known elements. By contrast, he said, the invention of the transistor itself, for which a Nobel Prize was awarded in 1956, required an intimate understanding of how electrons behave in semiconducting materials like silicon. Mr. Kilby disputed that assessment, saying that the writers of the news release accompanying the award ''did choose to point out the fact that there was some new physics involved.'' Dr. Alferov said the criticism did not apply to the research on heterostructures. ''This is a basic science achievement -- basic science with a lot of applications in engineering.'' Dr. Anders Barany, a professor of physics at Stockholm University and the secretary of the Nobel Committee for Physics, which recommends winners to the full Swedish Academy, admitted that this year's award was ''not in line with the other prizes'' in recent times and is of a more applied nature. ''Whether this marks a new direction is still a question,'' he said. The theme, however, is clear, he said. ''If you really think about it, what are these three inventions doing? They are the three inventions that are driving the Internet.'' Even some scientists involved in semiconductor research found the turn of events surprising. ''I frankly didn't think it would go in this direction,'' said Dr. Nick Holonyak Jr., a professor of electrical and computer engineering and physics at the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois."]

Cup semifinals brought relief, at least, but for a club of Arsenal\u2019s grandeur and ambition, doing so against such a lowly opponent simply meant the pain did not get worse. Wenger \u2014 the Premier League\u2019s longest-serving manager, in his job for 21 seasons, 16 ahead of his nearest competitor \u2014 knows that full well. Afterward, he was in a contemplative, even somber mood, bemoaning \u2014 as he often does \u2014 that \u201cnothing is good enough\u201d in modern soccer\u2019s frenzied, hyperbolic landscape."]
["sports/soccer", "Few would have expected him to be sociable, but he still extended the traditional invitation to Danny Cowley, Lincoln\u2019s manager, together with his brother and assistant Nicky, to join him in his office.

That week in March, a storm was raging around Arsenal. Wenger stood in its eye, unfazed, unflustered and unmoved. There is an old line about why England, in the turbulent years of the 19th and 20th centuries, never succumbed to revolution: because it rains too much. People tend not to take to the streets if they know they\u2019re likely to get soaked. The converse is true of Arsenal. Mutiny has been simmering at Arsenal for a decade, maybe more. Every couple of years, when the time comes to renew Wenger\u2019s contract, to extend his 21-season stay at the club, dissenting voices demand his departure. But there is always just enough sunshine to quell the rebellion: a fourth-place finish, another year in the Champions League, maybe an F.A. Cup thrown in for good measure."]
["sports/soccer", "These last two months, the unrest has manifested at almost every game. At the start of April, Arsenal hosted Manchester City. Outside its Emirates Stadium, a van had been festooned with messages demanding Wenger\u2019s departure. Inside, as the club\u2019s chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, was meeting with fan groups, promising that this summer would be a \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d at Arsenal, others were handing out leaflets, trying to stir the masses to overthrow the gilded chains Wenger has bound them in. Arsenal was in the midst of its worst run under Wenger\u2019s aegis; another defeat, it seemed, might finally tip the club over the edge, into outright insurrection. When Leroy San\u00e9 put Manchester City ahead, the reaction was not disappointment, or encouragement, but anger. Theo Walcott equalized for Arsenal; two minutes later, Sergio Ag\u00fcero restored City\u2019s lead. More venom, more poison, more rage against Wenger\u2019s machine. There were jeers at halftime. Wenger has long given the impression he would quit if that was the consensus of the fans, but the protesters have never been in a majority. Even now, when one group hired an airplane to buzz over a match against West Bromwich Albion at the end of March demanding Wenger\u2019s removal, another group did the same, asking that he stay. Against City, though, the mutineers must have felt their moment had come. More and more \u201cWenger Out\u201d signs were visible at games; they were popping up across the world, too, in political protests in Belgrade, at soccer matches in South Africa, at WrestleMania. The time for uprising was at hand."]
["sports/soccer", "A few minutes later, Shkodran Mustafi equalized again. Arsenal salvaged a draw. There is always just enough sunshine. Early in February, Ian Wright, the ebullient former Arsenal striker, and his wife attended an exclusive dinner at Emirates Stadium. Wenger, his erstwhile manager, was there, too. After steak and potatoes dauphinoise, Wenger gave an address to the room in which he acknowledged that he was \u201ccoming to the end\u201d of his career. The next evening, Wright was a guest on a BBC radio program. He relayed what Wenger had said and, when pressed, admitted he felt that Wenger had looked weary. \u201cHe was fine when we were talking about how the kids were doing, stuff like that,\u201d Wright remembered this week. \u201cBut when we started talking football, it was as though he had to take a deep breath.\u201d Wenger has since said the meal came at the end of a long day. Wright stands by his impression of Wenger that evening, even if since that point, he said, he has heard \u201cnothing but fighting talk\u201d from him. At the time, though, Wright\u2019s comments unleashed a wave of speculation that this time, Wenger was ready to step down. It had long been known that the club had a two-year contract extension ready for him to sign, whenever he had the time; now Chips Keswick, Arsenal\u2019s gloriously aristocratic chairman, had released a statement saying any renewal would be \u201cmutual,\u201d a subtle but significant change of tack."]
["sports/soccer", "Wenger has been asked, every week since, if he will stay or go. His answer has always been the same: All will be revealed at the end of the season. \u201cThe way he is dealing with it is fantastic,\u201d said Patrick Vieira, the New York City F.C. manager, who anchored some of Wenger\u2019s greatest teams. Wenger\u2019s reasoning is not always consistent \u2014 sometimes he says that he has decided, other times that he has not \u2014 but most within the club think the silence means he is staying. \u201cHe has the air of a man in control of what is happening,\u201d Wright said. If he has told anyone, one way or the other, within Arsenal\u2019s hierarchy, the secret is guarded jealously. He has, certainly, not told his players, although he admits they have asked. They are not surprised to be left in the dark: Players do not see him as the greatest of communicators. He abhors confrontation, or any sort of awkward conversation: He neither told Gilberto Silva that he was being stripped of the club captaincy \u2014 he read about it on the club website \u2014 nor, a few years later, informed Per Mertesacker that he was being awarded it. For Mertesacker, the decision was confirmed only when he was asked if he had written his first set of notes for the match-day program."]

Dick Law, who oversees Arsenal\u2019s transfer business, has been holding meetings with agents; the club is set on signing a left back and going from there. Arsenal may, eventually, appoint a sporting director of some sort. The club is planning for the future. Only Wenger knows, really, if he is involved in it. For a man who has devoted his life to his sport, Wenger often sounds as if he loathes vast swaths of it. Not the game itself, but the soccer-industrial complex that has sprung up around it. In his news media briefings, he regularly starts sentences with a variation on the phrase \u201cwe live in a world:\u201d We live in a world only of winners and losers (August 2005); we live in a world of emotion and excess (February 2013); we live in a world where what is superficial is at the heart of the debate (April 2017). It is easy to believe there is a part of him that might be relieved to walk away. Those who know him see that. \u201cHe gets affected by the negativity,\u201d Vieira said. \u201cWhen things are not going right, the criticism hurts.\u201d But equally, they do not know what would fill the void. It is a theme that recurs in conversations with Wenger\u2019s friends and former colleagues, this sense that he endures as much out of fear of what comes next as love for all he has done."]

["world/asia", "China\u2019s Premier, Li Keqiang, Strikes Upbeat Tone Amid U.S. Tensions - The New York Times BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, defended his government on Wednesday as a bulwark of economic and regional stability, arguing that smoldering tensions with the Trump administration over trade imbalances, North Korea and other disputes in Asia could be solved through dialogue. The comments appeared intended to set an upbeat tone for a first meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that is provisionally scheduled for next month at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. In an annual news conference that lasted more than two hours, Mr. Li stressed his optimism about relations with the United States. \u201cThis relationship is crucial for not just China and the United States, but also for regional and global peace, security and stability, and we have to protect its progress,\u201d Mr. Li told hundreds of reporters at the end of the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress. Mr. Li\u2019s comments, under giant chandeliers in the lavish Golden Hall at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square, showed how quickly the outward mood in relations had shifted. Before and after his election victory in November, Mr. Trump threw down a series of challenges that rattled policy makers in Beijing. Mr. Trump threatened to punish China over its yawning trade surplus with the United States. Last year, the United States\u2019 deficit in trade in goods with China reached $347 billion, and Mr. Trump has promised to close that gap, which he has also attributed to what he calls China\u2019s rigged currency exchange policies. Many economists say that claim is an oversimplification."]
["world/asia", "Mr. Trump also suggested he might abandon longstanding American policy on Taiwan, the self-governed island that China treats as an illegitimate breakaway territory. His secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, promised to stop China\u2019s building of islands as military outposts in the disputed South China Sea, where the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighbors have competing territorial claims. But since Mr. Trump took office, Chinese diplomats have pressed his administration to retreat from positions that could ignite an early crisis in relations. In February, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi spoke over the phone, and Mr. Trump reaffirmed established American policy that Taiwan was a part of \u201cone China.\u201d Administration officials have reined in warnings of possible military action in the South China Sea. And so far, at least, the White House has not introduced measures that could sharply cut the flow of Chinese goods into the United States. Those sources of tension could still flare, especially over trade and the South China Sea, where the Trump administration has promised to establish a more robust naval presence. The Trump administration is also likely to sell Taiwan a large order of weapons, which could renew tensions over that issue. But like other Chinese leaders recently, Mr. Li put a bright veneer over those concerns. He said a trade war of tit-for-tat protectionist measures would ultimately damage the American economy."]
["world/asia", "Mr. Li said that if a trade war broke out between China and the United States, foreign companies operating in China, \u201cin particular American companies, would bear the brunt.\u201d He said he was citing findings published by a foreign think tank, apparently referring to the extra costs that American companies would face buying goods in China for the American market. He also stressed that China would pay close attention to whether Mr. Trump\u2019s administration stuck to the One China policy, which in effect denies Taiwan the possibility of recognition as a separate country, something to which pro-independence groups in Taiwan aspire. \u201cThis policy constitutes the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and cannot and must not be shaken by vicissitudes,\u201d Mr. Li said of the One China policy. On North Korea, another issue over which the two powers have been at odds, Mr. Li repeated Beijing\u2019s position that only renewed negotiations with Pyongyang stood a chance of curtailing its nuclear program. China, the North\u2019s neighbor and sole major ally, hosted long-running multinational talks on the issue that fell apart after 2009. \u201cWe hope that through the efforts of all parties the tense atmosphere can be eased and the parties can return to the track of dialogue,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cNobody wants to have a constant ruckus all day at his doorstep.\u201d But Mr. Li stopped short of criticizing the antimissile system that the United States began deploying in South Korea last week as a shield against missiles from the North. China has vehemently opposed the system, which it says could also track its intercontinental ballistic missiles, undermining their potency as a nuclear deterrent."]
["world/asia", "The secretary of state, Mr. Tillerson, is scheduled to visit Beijing over the weekend for talks about the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi and also to discuss regional trouble spots, especially North Korea. For Mr. Li, his annual news conference at the end of the legislative session was a rare chance to dominate the political stage, which is usually filled by the near-omnipresent president, Mr. Xi. Unlike his recent predecessors, Mr. Li has not taken a lead in setting economic policy, and some observers have wondered whether he might be replaced as premier after his first term ends next year. But on Wednesday, Mr. Li held center stage, while crediting Mr. Xi with keeping the economy in good health since they were elected premier and president in 2013. Mr. Li presented an optimistic view of China\u2019s economy this year. At the opening of the meeting last week, Mr. Li said the government wanted the economy to grow 6.5 percent or more in 2017. The target represented a slight easing from last year\u2019s goal, which was 6.5 to 7 percent. China\u2019s economy grew 6.7 percent last year, according to official statistics. At his news conference, Mr. Li said that the 6.5 percent target differed little from last year\u2019s target. \u201cWe believe that China will continue to be a strong driving force in the face of a sluggish global economy,\u201d he said. But the trade-offs between stoking growth and fixing underlying economic problems have become increasingly difficult and contentious."]
["world/asia", "The government says the economy must keep expanding at a relatively fast pace to create enough urban jobs for roughly 11 million rural migrants and new university graduates this year. Mr. Xi will also oversee a big leadership shake-up at a Communist Party congress this autumn, when he starts his second term as party leader, magnifying the government\u2019s hunger for social confidence and stability. Yet ever since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, China has come to depend on bigger and bigger injections of bank lending and other credit to fire up investment and demand. That worries economists, who say that increasingly heavy debt and misspending will eventually drag down growth. China has limited its budget deficit to about 3 percent of economic output, a modest fiscal stimulus. But it has been rapidly increasing total debt in the economy, with overall credit expanding last year by an amount equal to almost one-sixth of the country\u2019s economic output. Much of the lending has ended up in housing and construction projects, including new expressways and airports. That investment has increasingly taken place in less prosperous inland regions where demand is tepid. As a result, the growth dividend from each dollar of new credit has been shrinking year by year, even as nationwide debt, particularly borrowing by state-owned enterprises, has expanded briskly. Mr. Li, however, sought to allay worries about rising Chinese debt. He said that there was no risk to the overall financial system and that the Chinese government\u2019s relatively low budget deficit and large capital bases in banks would protect the country."]

["technology", "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success - The New York Times It is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days. For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail. Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties. Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity."]
["technology", "Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies. Tensions have escalated in the industry in recent months as some ride-hailing companies have worked to figure out what to do with their most expensive operations. This month, Uber, which has raised far more money than Lyft, agreed to sell its Chinese subsidiary to Didi, the biggest ride-hailing company in China. The deal freed Uber from a cash-draining battle for dominance in the Chinese market. But the move also disrupted a global alliance that Lyft had struck with Didi and others to fight Uber. Lyft has not said whether it will continue working with Didi, but the dissolution of a partnership could stymie Lyft\u2019s growth prospects. Representatives from Lyft, Google, Amazon, Apple, G.M., Didi and Uber declined to comment on talks. The Information earlier reported on talks between G.M. and Lyft. Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation."]
["technology", "That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure. The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment. Lyft failed to find a buyer partly because of cost, the people said. Lyft was valued at $5.5 billion after an investment round by G.M. and others in January, making it one of the more pre-eminent unicorn companies in Silicon Valley. Any sale would most likely have to fetch a premium from Lyft\u2019s last valuation to be desirable to the company and its investors. Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials. That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs."]

Sidecar, an app that competed with Uber and Lyft, shut down in December, citing a \u201csignificant capital disadvantage\u201d compared with others in the market. \u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201d Lyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability. Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201d"]

And one holdover comedy, \u201cHappy Endings,\u201d has rewarded Mr. Lee\u2019s faith in it by improving 55 percent this season. Over all, ABC has managed to stay just about even with its ratings for last season, which comes as a surprise to some, given the continued decline for several of the network\u2019s longtime hits. Many of the pillars of ABC\u2019s prime-time success were facing either retirement (\u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d) or a steady decline in ratings (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d)"]
["business/media", "But now, Mr. Lee and other ABC executives are promoting several of their coming midseason entries as perhaps stronger than those introduced in the fall. All of this comes from Mr. Lee, a programmer who stands out not only for his British accent, but also for his background in cable television \u2014 and his demeanor. Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of ABC\u2019s parent company, Walt Disney, said, \u201cThe best thing about Paul is that he\u2019s a grown-up.\u201d At 51, Mr. Lee indeed is grown up. And he may be the only top network programmer ever to graduate from Oxford with fluency in both Portuguese and Russian. That doesn\u2019t precisely translate to being able to recognize which sitcom or reality show might find an audience of 18- to 49-year-old women, but Mr. Lee said it doesn\u2019t hurt either. \u201cYou have to bring some humility to it if you\u2019re an outsider,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, you can use an incredibly talented team around you and your own approach and really make something different.\u201d Given the situation ABC faced at the end of last season, with \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d ready to end after an eighth and final season, and the \u201cDancing\u201d franchise starting to leak younger viewers (it remains hugely popular among older women), Mr. Lee faced considerable pressure as he introduced the first slate of shows he had personally developed and selected. \u201cBut to some degree, pressure is liberating,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cI came in thinking we absolutely had to take some big swings.\u201d"]
["business/media", "He also thought \u201cabout what\u2019s going to work well in tough times.\u201d That led to comparisons \u201cto the 1930s and the 1970s,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cComedy was so big then. Fairy tales were big then. Horror was big; the underdog was big.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd were we ambitious? Superambitious.\u201d He also conceded that luck played a significant role. While some of the bedrock hits of ABC were unquestionably in decline, Mr. Lee retained an ace no other network could match: the comedy \u201cModern Family,\u201d already a hit, exploded this fall after a deluge of Emmy Awards. \u201cSome of this is definitely luck,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have the best ideas but they don\u2019t always click.\u201d Mr. Lee pushed his luck with \u201cHappy Endings,\u201d a comedy that had become a personal favorite and one that attracted much online chatter. His decision to bring it back for a second season shocked much of the television business because the show was dispersing the big lead-in audience from \u201cModern Family.\u201d But as that comedy soared this year, \u201cHappy Endings\u201d found a much larger audience (though it still loses a large percentage of the \u201cModern Family\u201d audience.) Perhaps the most underrated strength Mr. Lee has brought to ABC is his background in cable. One senior executive from a competing media company said, \u201cEveryone wanted to dis Paul Lee because he was an outsider from cable. But that was just what ABC needed.\u201d"]

He began his career in Britain as a journalist, covering the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, but moved into directing for television, first documentaries and then scripted programs. He became what is known in television as a showrunner, one in charge of all aspects of running a series. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I am so passionate about the network picking great showrunners and giving them room.\u201d As for the experience in cable, Mr. Lee said that was vital. \u201cThat\u2019s why we staggered the launch of shows this fall, because what happens in cable is you have to throw your whole network at a show you believe in.\u201d ABC held back \u201cSuburgatory\u201d one week after the start of the season. It held back \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d three weeks and \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d for a month. \u201cTo not have to launch three shows in three days, that\u2019s a little bit of cable marketing up against a whole lot of broadcast programming,\u201d Mr. Lee said. The coming shows he is talking most about include a serial drama called GCB (now standing for \u201cGood Christian Belles\u201d) and the latest addition to the female-based comedy \u201cApt. 23,\u201d which also has been known as \u201cDon\u2019t Trust the B---- in Apt. 23.\u201d"]

Grimm, the Republican representing New York\u2019s 11th Congressional District, who carried the burden of a 20-count federal indictment to a landslide re-election in November, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a single felony charge of tax fraud. Representative Grimm said he had no intention of stepping down. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. He sounded equally resolute when he declared himself \u201cguilty\u201d to Judge Pamela K. Chen of United States District Court in Brooklyn, who accepted his plea and noted that it included his signing of a \u201cstatement of facts\u201d in which he acknowledged committing perjury, hiring illegal immigrants and committing wire fraud. Judge Chen then commanded Mr. Grimm to return to court for sentencing on June 8. Federal prosecutors, who along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service have investigated Mr. Grimm for years, are seeking a penalty of at least two years in prison. His lawyers, some of whom joined the proceedings via conference call from Florida, are asking for a more lenient sentence and will almost certainly recommend probation. Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, who is President Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Eric H. Holder Jr. as attorney general, said in a statement, \u201cWith today\u2019s guilty plea, Michael Grimm has admitted that while running his business he chose lies and deception over honest dealings with federal and state authorities as well as his own employees.\u201d"]

["nyregion", "The House could vote to censure, reprimand or, with the approval of two-thirds of its members, expel a felon from its ranks. One Republican congressman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a frank assessment of a colleague, said that there was a feeling that Mr. Grimm would eventually resign, and that he was holding onto his seat as a bargaining chip against further investigation. The pressure from leadership, the isolation in Congress and the potential inability even to cast a vote would force Mr. Grimm\u2019s hand, he said. But Mr. Grimm seemed fonder of his job than ever. Wearing a long blue overcoat, he read from a script, printed in large type, that could be described as kind of contrite. He sought to both accept responsibility for and shrug off as trivial his failure to accurately report revenues when he owned a Manhattan restaurant called Healthalicious. \u201cIt\u2019s true I had, for example, delivery boys that were paid off the books,\u201d Mr. Grimm said, though people often do the same with their \u201cnannies\u201d and \u201clandscapers.\u201d Still, he added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it right, and I\u2019m taking full responsibility for my actions.\u201d He then redefined \u201cfull.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, all of these, everything we\u2019re talking about here, happened before I was in Congress,\u201d he said \u2014 a sentence that was not accurate. The statement of facts he signed included an admission that he committed perjury in a deposition in 2013; he entered Congress in 2011."]
["nyregion", "Mr. Grimm then argued that many of his constituents evidently did not think the crime was a big deal. \u201cJust last month I had an unprecedented, overwhelming victory which shows that support,\u201d he said.

The United States and Canada play for Olympic gold in women\u2019s hockey, and the game usually goes down to the wire. This one did that and more. Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored the game-winning goal in a shootout on Thursday to give the United States a 3-2 victory against Canada, the four-time defending Olympic champion. Down a goal with seven minutes to play, the United States got an equalizer from Lamoureux-Davidson\u2019s sister, Monique Lamoureux-Morando, and matched Canada through overtime, even staving off a power play through the last 95 seconds. Then it was on to a shootout, which also went into overtime, after both teams netted two of their first five chances. In the first extra round, Lamoureux-Davidson scored first against Canada goaltender Shannon Szabados. A minute later, United States goaltender Maddie Rooney stopped a shot by Meghan Agosta of Canada to give the American women their first gold medal since 1998, when women\u2019s hockey made its debut as an Olympic sport. Before the shot, Rooney said, she looked over at the bench and saw her teammates indicating she needed just one more save, against Agosta. \u201cTo have their support made it a whole lot easier,\u201d said Rooney, 20, who is at her first Olympics. \u201cI just reacted to her, and then everything kind of went into a blur.\u201d"]
["sports/olympics", "Four years ago at the Sochi Games, Canada beat the United States in overtime, 3-2, to win gold. The scene at the end of these Olympic tournaments has almost always been the same: the Canadian women throwing sticks and gloves across the ice in celebration, while their American opponents wipe away tears, beginning the four-year countdown until their next shot at the sport\u2019s biggest prize. But their roles were reversed this time as Rooney turned Agosta away, and American sticks and gloves went airborne. The win was especially poignant for this group of American women. A year ago, they battled U.S.A. Hockey for better pay and work conditions, including by threatening to boycott a world championship tournament. Only a last-minute settlement that included hefty pay raises got them back onto the ice. The Lamoureux sisters were two of the leaders of that fight. This year\u2019s gold medal game had it all \u2014 lead changes, slick passing, game-saving goaltending, a healthy dose of contact and a raucous crowd that traded dueling chants of \u201cCanada\u201d and \u201cU.S.A.\u201d all afternoon. \u201cThis is a very classic example of how hard it should be,\u201d Robb Stauber, the American women\u2019s coach, said. The Canadian women played a classic Canadian-style game, using their skill and physicality to bully the Americans around the ice, raising their elbows and even a fist or two."]
["sports/olympics", "In one instance, as the Americans battled for an equalizing goal with 16 minutes left, forward Brianna Decker was trying to get on the other end of a centering pass when she took a fist to the face from Marie-Philip Poulin, captain of the Canadian team, and crumpled to the ice. No penalty was called. \u201cI\u2019ll have a good scar, but it\u2019s a pretty good one to have,\u201d Decker said after the game. Forward Hilary Knight put the Americans on the scoreboard first, deflecting a shot by her teammate Sidney Morin past Szabados with 25 seconds to play in the first period. Knight\u2019s power-play goal came during the third man-advantage of the night for the Americans, but the lead didn\u2019t last for long. Two minutes into the second period, Blayre Turnbull of Canada beat a lunging Lee Stecklein of the United States down the right boards and threw the puck in front of the net. Just as the puck got there, so did Turnbull\u2019s teammate Haley Irwin, who redirected it past Rooney to tie the score. Five minutes later, the Canadians took the lead as Agosta grabbed a loose puck near the blue line, skated deep into the American zone and found Poulin for an open chance. Poulin didn\u2019t waste it, beating Rooney with a bullet into the upper shelf of the net. The Americans have tried to bring a new style to the ice in these Olympic Games, focusing on puck possession, creativity and slashing attacks through the seams in the opposing team\u2019s defense."]
["sports/olympics", "While it worked against everyone else here, and even produced a world championship last year, Canada looked for much of the afternoon as if it had figured out a very effective answer to it \u2014 muscle. From the drop of the puck Thursday afternoon, the Canadian women banged hard against the Americans. They had five penalties during the game \u2014 for illegal hits, interference and slashing, among other things \u2014 compared with three for the United States. When Knight, Dani Cameranesi and other slick-skating Americans tried to burst into open spaces, Canada\u2019s big defenders like Jocelyne Larocque were there to bump them off their stride. By the end of the second period, the Canadians had won the style battle, baiting the Americans to join them in the scrum. It worked until overtime, when each team uses only four skaters at a time, the ice opens up and speed takes over. That figured to favor the United States, which had wanted to play this way all along. The Americans controlled play in overtime, though Kacey Bellamy, Cameranesi and Megan Keller missed chances at the doorstep of the net. In the shootout, Knight had a chance to win it on the last shot of the first round, but Szabados stopped her with a pad save. Then it was up to Lamoureux-Davidson, who pulled the puck from backhand to forehand and slipped it past Szabados. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her make that move plenty of times,\u201d Lamoureux-Morando said of her sister. \u201cWe\u2019ve played this game in our minds a thousand times and won it every which way.\u201d"]

["nyregion/nyregionspecial2", "Perseverance and Chance Led to Reversal in \u201988 Murders - The New York Times IF Karlene Kovacs had not attended a small family dinner on Easter in 1991, Martin H. Tankleff probably would not have become a free man in 2007. \u201cI would most likely still be in prison today,\u201d Mr. Tankleff said in a recent interview. What Ms. Kovacs recalled hearing on that Easter Sunday  set off an improbable chain of events. They ultimately led \u2014 16 years later \u2014 an appellate court to overturn Mr. Tankleff\u2019s 1990 conviction for the murders of his parents. Mr. Tankleff  marvels at the many chance encounters and coincidences that eventually freed him in December. \u201cThroughout the case there have been all these things,\u201d he said. The last legal cloud lingering over him lifted last week when the state announced it would not retry him for the 1988 murders.  The state did not completely exonerate Mr. Tankleff, maintaining instead that there was  \u201csome evidence\u201d of his guilt, although not enough to convict.  Although the state also said \u201cthere is some evidence that others may have committed the killings,\u201d it considered the evidence too weak to prosecute them. Unless additional evidence arises, the investigation is now complete, a state official said. Back in 1991, a friend invited Ms. Kovacs to an Easter gathering in Suffolk County. There, she says, she was shocked to hear another guest, Joseph Creedon, bragging about being involved in the murders of Arlene and Seymour Tankleff  in their waterfront home  in Belle Terre."]
["nyregion/nyregionspecial2", "As Ms. Kovacs would recall, Mr. Creedon said he had been at the Tankleff home, hiding in the bushes before the attacks and afterward covered with blood. He said he knew that Martin had not killed his parents. Ms. Kovacs, who had been only vaguely aware of the case, said Mr. Creedon\u2019s statement haunted her. For years she confided only in her husband, who  eventually begged her to report it. So in 1994 she  decided to tell a retired police officer, Bill Navarra.  She knew Mr. Navarra by happenstance, from his visits to the car dealership where she was a saleswoman and his son was a manager. \u201cI felt very comfortable telling him,\u201d she said. Unknown to her, Mr. Navarra provided a fortuitous connection to the case. He worked as an investigator for Robert C. Gottlieb \u2014 Mr. Tankleff\u2019s trial lawyer. Soon Ms. Kovacs found herself in the lawyer\u2019s office, signing an affidavit. Especially intriguing was her recollection that Mr. Creedon had mentioned an accomplice named Steuerman.  Jerard Steuerman was Seymour Tankleff\u2019s embittered partner in a bagel store chain. They had been arguing over control of the business and Seymour Tankleff\u2019s demands that Mr. Steuerman start repaying a $500,000 debt to him, according to testimony. Mr. Steuerman was at the Tankleff home for a poker game on the night of the attacks and was the last player to leave. From the start, Martin Tankleff had accused Mr. Steuerman of being behind the killings. Mr. Steuerman denied involvement, and the police never considered him a suspect."]
["nyregion/nyregionspecial2", "Mr. Gottlieb contacted the Suffolk district attorney\u2019s office about Ms. Kovacs. But after a preliminary investigation, nothing happened. Her  information sat dormant until fate intervened several years later, through yet another series of coincidences. \u201cYears were wasted,\u201d Ms. Kovacs said, \u201cand it kills me.\u201d During his 17 years in prison, Mr. Tankleff filed numerous state and federal court appeals. He estimated that he received  up to $15 million in free legal representation from lawyers in major firms, including Baker Botts in Washington, whose senior partner is the former secretary of state James A. Baker III. That legal service came by way of another fortunate connection: Laura A. Taichman, a fellow students of Mr. Tankleff at a Port Jefferson high school and a former co-worker at the bagel stores. She was an intern at a Washington law firm where, one day, two lawyers, Stephen L. Braga and Barry J. Pollack, were discussing pro bono work. She  proposed Mr. Tankleff\u2019s appeal, and they have been on the case ever since. Without Ms. Taichman, Mr. Tankleff said, \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t have had this terrific team of people.\u201d  He also credited other lawyers in the effort, including Kirsten Levingston and Jennifer O\u2019Connor, and Mr. Braga\u2019s assistant, Meg Griffin. The appeals focused on Mr. Tankleff\u2019s much-disputed confession. In an interrogation, Detective James McCready told Mr. Tankleff that physical evidence implicated him and claimed that his wounded father had awoken at the hospital and identified the son as the attacker. Those were lies, the detective  later acknowledged, but the tactics were legal."]
["nyregion/nyregionspecial2", "Under that questioning, Mr. Tankleff wondered if he could have \u201cblacked out\u201d and attacked his parents. The police wrote a confession, which he never signed and almost immediately  disavowed. But it became the linchpin of his convictions. Some appeals came tantalizingly close. One state panel split 2 to 2, but a fifth judge, added to break the tie, ruled against Mr. Tankleff. Another time, a federal court said that his appeal was valid under state rules, but that as a federal court it could not enforce state standards. Mr. Tankleff\u2019s luck finally began to change late in 2001. A fellow inmate, Austin Offen, had praised the work of a Long Island lawyer, Bruce A. Barket, and his investigator, Jay Salpeter. Coincidentally, Mr. Tankleff\u2019s aunt, Marianne McClure, and a  friend, Paul Lerner, each sent him a Newsday clipping about the lawyer and investigator. So Mr. Tankleff wrote to them. Mr. Tankleff said  Mr. Salpeter told him: \u201cIf you\u2019re innocent, Marty, hire me. If you\u2019re not, don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d Mr. Tankleff passed a polygraph test, and Mr. Salpeter took the case for a $5,000 fee that would turn into years of pro bono work. As Mr. Salpeter, a retired New York City homicide detective, reviewed case files, the 1994 Kovacs affidavit was the obvious lead.  He checked Mr. Creedon\u2019s long arrest record, seeking accomplices who might know something."]
["nyregion/nyregionspecial2", "That produced Glenn Harris, who was in prison for another crime. After courting him by mail, Mr. Salpeter took Mr. Harris\u2019s mother to visit him. \u201cNever in a million years did I expect what he told me,\u201d Mr. Salpeter said.  Breaking open the case, Mr. Harris said he had been the getaway driver who took Mr. Creedon and another man, Peter Kent, to the Tankleff home. Citing this new evidence, Mr. Tankleff\u2019s lawyers filed a new appeal. Though Mr. Harris refused to testify without immunity and changed his story, and Mr. Creedon and Mr. Kent denied involvement under oath, other witnesses came forward corroborating Mr. Harris\u2019s initial version. \u201cIt was amazing how one person led to another, led to another, led to another,\u201d Mr. Salpeter said. Mr. Salpeter also brought resources  that proved crucial. Lonnie Soury, an acquaintance from Mr. Salpeter\u2019s childhood in  Queens, volunteered his Manhattan public relations firm to drum up local and national newspaper and TV coverage. Mr. Soury\u2019s associate Eric Friedman organized a Tankleff Web site that drew support \u2014 and tips \u2014worldwide. Media coverage \u201cwas absolutely huge\u201d in winning his case, Mr. Tankleff said. A CBS \u201c48 Hours\u201d program reported evidence implicating Mr. Creedon.  Joseph Guarascio, Mr. Creedon\u2019s son, said in an affidavit that after he saw the program and asked about it, his father confessed in detail. Then Mr. Guarascio came forward as a witness. There were many others."]
["nyregion/nyregionspecial2", "Among them, a prison priest, the Rev. Ronald Lemmert, testified that Mr. Harris had confessed to him and had given him permission to testify. William Ram, a salesman and ex-convict, testified that Mr. Creedon, Mr. Kent and Mr. Harris had visited him en route to the Tankleff home. James Graydon, a restaurant worker, testified that Mr. Creedon had initially tried to recruit him to attack a partner in the bagel business.

The AfD shocked Germany in the fall when it became the first far-right party to enter Parliament since World War II. But that breakthrough not only shattered a significant postwar taboo. It has also enormously complicated the task of forming a new governing coalition, leaving Germany and all of Europe in months of limbo."]
["world/europe", "Ms. Merkel and her conservative alliance are negotiating a coalition deal with their former governing partners, the left-leaning Social Democrats. If they do, the AfD will be Germany\u2019s primary opposition party, leaving a wide opening for it to pick up even more traditionally left-leaning voters who fear the Social Democrats have been co-opted. Many fear that the AfD, as the leading voice of the opposition, would have a perfect perch to turn the protest vote it received in national elections in September \u2014 it finished third with 13 percent of the vote \u2014 into a loyal and sustained following. \u201cIf we go back into government, the AfD will overtake us,\u201d predicted Hilde Mattheis, a Social Democratic lawmaker from Baden-Wurttemberg, where that has already happened. The 92 AfD lawmakers, who have been busy moving into their new parliamentary offices in central Berlin, have not been shy about using the spotlight. One, J\u00fcrgen Pohl, recently addressed Parliament and criticized the labor market changes that former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of the Social Democratic Party passed from 2003 to 2005, saying they created a host of poorly regulated, precarious jobs. The AfD, Mr. Pohl said, \u201cis a new people\u2019s party that cares about the little people.\u201d When some center-left lawmakers guffawed, Mr. Pohl pointed at the television cameras. \u201cGo ahead and laugh,\u201d he said, \u201cyour voters are watching.\u201d Indeed, they are. The AfD has already overtaken the Social Democrats as the second-biggest party in state elections across much of what was formerly East Germany. In Bavaria, it is not far behind."]
["world/europe", "But Mr. Reil believes his party has the greatest potential in places like Bottrop, in the Ruhr area, once the industrial heartland of West Germany and long a bastion of Social Democratic and union power. The Ruhr has produced coal since the 16th century, and it shaped modern Germany in the process. It powered the Industrial Revolution, two world wars, the postwar economic miracle and even European integration: The coal and steel community was the seedling of the European Union. But today, Bottrop and surrounding cities are in decline. Mr. Reil has worked in six mines, five of which have closed. Along with some 2,500 others, he will take early retirement, at 48, after the last mine ceases production in December.

Mr. Hilburger, who has been at the company for 28 years, is not a member of the AfD but he votes for it. He thinks the party and his union are a natural fit. When it emerged that he had once played for a band associated with neo-Nazis, the news media reported the fact widely.

This spring, Mr. Hilburger, who calls his musical past \u201ca sin of youth,\u201d is fielding more than 250 candidates in at least four factories.

The AfD has understood that.\u201d"]
["world/europe", "The AfD is ideologically divided, with many senior members staunchly capitalist and suspicious of labor unions. The strategic focus on the working class speaks to the challenge of turning protest voters into a loyal base, said Oskar Niedermayer, a professor of political science at the Free University in Berlin. \u201cBreaking into the union milieu is key to that strategy,\u201d Mr. Niedermayer said. He warned that the reflex to ostracize the AfD could backfire. Some unions are advising members to shun anyone in the AfD. Some soccer clubs are planning to outright bar them. And as Mr. Niedermayer pointed out, lawmakers from other parties have systematically blocked every AfD candidate for senior parliamentary posts. \u201cIt confirms them in their role as victims of the elites,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers who see themselves as victims of the elites will only identify with them more.\u201d As the AfD appeals to Germany\u2019s left-behinds, it is also trying to tie them to other parts of the party\u2019s agenda, like its hard line on immigration. For instance, the battle cry of Frank-Christian Hansel, an AfD member of Berlin\u2019s state Parliament, is to save the German welfare state \u2014 but for Germans. \u201cIf you want social justice, you need to manage who is coming into your country,\u201d Mr. Hansel said. \u201cOpen borders and welfare state don\u2019t go together.\u201d It is the kind of rhetoric that sets the AfD apart from the traditional left, even as it goes fishing for voters in Social Democratic waters."]

["health", "Hand-Held Treatment for Overdoses Is Approved - The New York Times Federal health regulators approved a drug overdose treatment device on Thursday that experts say will provide a powerful lifesaving tool in the midst of a surging epidemic of prescription drug abuse. Similar to an EpiPen used to stop allergic reactions to bee stings, the easy-to-use injector \u2014 small enough to tuck into a pocket or a medicine cabinet \u2014 can be used by the relatives or friends of people who have overdosed. The hand-held device, called Evzio, delivers a single dose of naloxone, a medication that reverses the effects of an overdose, and will be used on those who have stopped breathing or lost consciousness from an opioid drug overdose. Naloxone is the standard treatment in such circumstances, but until now, has been available mostly in hospitals and other medical settings, when it is often used too late to save the patient. The decision to quickly approve the new treatment, which is expected to be available this summer, comes as deaths from opioids continue to mount, including an increase in those from heroin, which contributed to the death of the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in February. Federal health officials, facing criticism for failing to slow the rising death toll, are under pressure to act, experts say. \u201cThis is a big deal, and I hope gets wide attention,\u201d said Dr. Carl R. Sullivan III, director of the addictions program at West Virginia University. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: Having these things in the hands of people around drug addicts just makes sense because you\u2019re going to prevent unnecessary mortality.\u201d"]
["health", "The scourge of drug abuse has battered states across the country, with deaths from overdoses now outstripping those from traffic crashes. Prescription drugs alone now account for more than half of all drug overdose deaths, and one major category of them, opioids, or painkillers, take the lives of more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined. Deaths from opioids have quadrupled in 10 years to more than 16,500 in 2010, according to federal data. Once turned on, the new instruments will give verbal instruction about how to deliver the medication, similar to automated defibrillators that hang in public buildings. Food and Drug Administration officials said they speedily approved the device in just 15 weeks because it is critical to prevent deaths. Experts applauded the F.D.A.\u2019s decision, saying it could lead to the broad dissemination of the drug, which has rarely been available to the families and friends of drug abusers, who are often the first to find them when they have overdosed. Dr. Nathaniel Katz, assistant professor of anesthesia at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, whose company, Analgesic Solutions, develops treatments for pain, said the approval would \u201ccatalyze the adoption of this treatment.\u201d \u201cWe have 17,000 fatal opioid overdoses every year,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can potentially prevent a chunk of them with this technique.\u201d Deaths have climbed despite efforts by states and the federal government. In January 2013, an expert panel convened by the F.D.A. recommended tightening prescription practices. In September, the F.D.A. changed labeling requirements to indicate that the opioids only be used in patients with no other treatment options for their pain."]
["health", "The agency\u2019s critics said it was drawing attention to its approval of the new device \u2014 the conference call for reporters included Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary \u2014 because it was defensive about its record on opioids. The F.D.A. has been under pressure since last fall when it approved Zohydro, a new hydrocodone drug, a prescription opioid, against the advice of an expert panel. The drug differs from other painkillers in that it is a pure form of hydrocodone, without acetaminophen, in an extended release form, and the agency contended that it would help patients who needed longer-term treatment for pain and wanted to avoid the risks of liver problems from acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. But health officials who deal with abuse of opioids strongly objected to the approval, saying the drug was an unnecessary addition to the long list of pain drugs on the market. In December, attorneys general from 28 states wrote the agency\u2019s commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, asking her to reconsider the approval. Massachusetts announced a ban on the drug last week, and last month, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, submitted a bill to require the F.D.A. to reverse its decision. Dr. Katz of Tufts University said the federal government could be doing more to combat the drug epidemic, for example requiring doctors who prescribe highly addictive opioids to get training in how to do it properly. Such training is now voluntary, though Dr. Hamburg said on a conference call on Thursday that she believed it should be mandatory."]

In Massachusetts and Maryland, police departments have a standing order from health departments to allow emergency medical workers to use naloxone. In New Jersey and Ohio, there are laws allowing people who may witness an overdose to administer naloxone. But Dr. Eric Edwards, chief medical officer of Kal\u00e9o, the pharmaceutical company that produces Evzio, said naloxone treatment used outside hospitals today involved injectable formulations with glass vials, syringes and, in about half the cases, attachments requiring assembly to create a nasal spray. The new device is the shape of a credit card, the thickness of a cellphone, and has a contractible needle the user never even sees. The company said they had not yet finalized the price.

["business/economy", "China Tightens Controls on Overseas Use of Its Currency - The New York Times SHANGHAI \u2014 As an exodus of money adds to the pressure on a slowing economy, regulators are trying to put the brakes on overseas use of China\u2019s currency by increasing the scrutiny of certain overseas deals. The decision to restrict overseas use of the renminbi represents a setback in China\u2019s long-term drive to turn the currency into a rival to the dollar and euro in the global marketplace. Beijing had pursued a greater role for the renminbi as a way to increase its economic influence. Part of the renminbi\u2019s appeal in international finance was that most Chinese companies could borrow and spend it overseas while seldom seeking approval from financial regulators in Beijing. But that leniency created a problem for China. The currency flowed out of the country in recent months and then traded heavily overseas, beyond the control of China\u2019s regulators. The situation has contributed to the currency\u2019s steady weakening against the strong dollar this autumn. That weakness, in turn, has prompted some Chinese businesses and households to move even more money out of the country before its value can erode further. \u201cThe authorities, under the relentless pressures of capital outflows, are poised to impose extensive restrictions on capital movements, marking a reversal of the gradual liberalizations introduced in recent years,\u201d Fred Hu, the chairman of the Primavera Capital Group, an investment firm based in Beijing and Hong Kong, wrote in an email reply to questions."]
["business/economy", "\u201cWhile such capital controls may be intended to be temporary,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey will introduce mounting uncertainties for Chinese outbound investments.\u201d In an effort to slow the exodus, an affiliate of China\u2019s central bank, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, issued a directive to bankers on Monday that amounted to additional scrutiny. The directive, which was quickly and broadly circulated within China\u2019s financial community, told banks that their domestic customers must check with the Beijing regulator before transferring $5 million or more \u2014 in dollars or renminbi \u2014 out of the country. The rules will also cover renminbi that is sitting in overseas accounts, which had previously escaped most regulation. \u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China in Shanghai is facing great pressure to keep a balance\u201d between inflows to and outflows from China, said the directive, referring to the Shanghai office of the central bank. The directive said that 5.1 trillion renminbi, or $740 billion, sluiced out of China in the first 10 months of this year while only 3.1 trillion came back into the country. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange declined Tuesday evening to respond to a faxed question regarding offshore renminbi, suggesting that the question should be submitted instead to the People\u2019s Bank of China. The central bank did not respond to questions late Tuesday evening. Government directives are not supposed to be public in China. In a sign of government irritation at the unauthorized distribution, censors reached into private WeChat social media accounts on Tuesday and deleted copies of the directive."]
["business/economy", "The rules appear to take aim at a relatively discrete set of overseas deals that largely allow companies to pull money out of the country, rather than more strategic acquisitions. Many Chinese companies, for example, have used their overseas subsidiaries to buy or borrow renminbi in Hong Kong, London, New York and elsewhere from the international arms of Chinese banks. Some of them then sell the renminbi and buy dollars, in a bet that the dollar will strengthen. The new rules will apply broadly to Chinese companies. In the past, only companies with headquarters in Beijing typically had to notify the government of big moves in offshore renminbi. Even so, the new rules amount more to a modest tweak than an outright overhaul. Capital controls in China already restrict the movement of money. Individuals, for example, are not supposed to move more than $50,000 out of the country annually. Companies, too, have limits and other approval processes. The latest directive basically adds another layer of approval and closes some additional escape valves. \u201cThey are not changing the rules,\u201d said Jeffrey Sun, a partner in the Shanghai office of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, a global law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s that, internally, they need to go through this extensive process.\u201d While Chinese regulators are increasing their scrutiny, they have been reluctant to ban overseas investment outright. Four different regulators issued a joint public statement on Monday through the official Xinhua news agency to emphasize that it was still acceptable for Chinese companies and households to invest overseas."]
["business/economy", "China\u2019s overseas investments have \u201cplayed an important role in deepening China\u2019s mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries and promoting domestic economic restructuring and upgrading,\u201d the statement said. But even those more strategic deals may soon get a second look. Regulators are also drafting rules that would require prior approval from Beijing for very large overseas corporate acquisitions. The draft rules on very large acquisitions, first reported by The Wall Street Journal last Friday and subsequently confirmed by bankers and executives who were briefed on the plans, would mandate that prior approval be obtained for deals exceeding $1 billion in real estate or in industries outside the Chinese company\u2019s main area of business. Any acquisition would also require prior approval if it exceeded $10 billion. But some bankers are skeptical that such rules will make much of a difference. Most large Chinese deals, like the pending acquisition of Switzerland\u2019s Syngenta by the state-owned China National Chemical Corporation, involve well-connected companies that have long received top-level endorsement for their bids in advance anyway. \u201cThe companies behind these large acquisitions are themselves very influential, and many will still find ways to close targeted deals,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai investment advisory firm."]

["us/politics", "This month, Mr. Gorka told CNN that the group would bring private industry expertise to bear on a range of issues, including cybersecurity, veterans affairs and the modernization of government technological systems. \u201cThat is very different from what the National Security Council is doing every day under the sterling leadership of General Flynn,\u201d he added, referring to Michael T. Flynn, then the national security adviser, who would resign 12 days later. Ms. Smith said she was not personally familiar with Mr. Gorka, though she had crossed paths with him during the early 2000s. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe about this guy, but given his experience at Breitbart and what I had heard years ago, it does appear to me that he takes some rather extreme views,\u201d she said. Mr. Gorka dismissed such criticisms during a Wednesday interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News and brushed aside some of the more controversial reports buzzing around him. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing our job very well \u2014 don\u2019t you, Sean? \u2014 if this is the best they can do,\u201d he said. He referred to reports, like one from Fusion, that said he had exaggerated his role as an expert witness in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of helping to carry out the Boston bombing of 2013. Mr. Gorka told Mr. Hannity he still had invoices for the expert report he submitted for the case. \u201cI may not have taken the stand, but I was an expert on the Boston bombing trial,\u201d he said."]
["us/politics", "As for the speculations about  Nazi sympathies, they go back to one of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration balls, when Mr. Gorka \u2014 appearing in photos and a video interview with Mr. Hannity \u2014 wore a medal that could be interpreted as a nod to Miklos Horthy, a Hungarian leader who entered into a strained alliance with Nazi Germany in the early years of World War II. In a video posted by Breitbart on Tuesday, Mr. Gorka said the medal belonged to his father, who he said had suffered \u201cunder both the Nazis and the Communists\u201d in Hungary, having lived through World War II and survived torture under the Soviet-imposed government that later came to power. Mr. Gorka was charged with a misdemeanor after he took  a handgun into Reagan National Airport in Virginia last year.

["business/dealbook", "Many Messages in the G.M. Settlement - The New York Times One of the biggest product defects in recent American manufacturing history, linked to at least 124 deaths and numerous injuries, was traceable to a mundane automobile part, the ignition switch. For General Motors, the debacle over how it handled that defect scarred the organization as it had to admit to repeated failures in simply identifying the problem that reflected a corporate culture that seemed to prize inaction and deflection. The settlement with the Justice Department that requires G.M. to pay $900 million, along with the resolution of a number of private lawsuits for which it set aside another $575 million, means the company has largely put the controversy to rest. But any case that involves a well-known company \u2014 the oft-repeated misquote of a former G.M. chief executive, Charles E. Wilson, that \u201cwhat\u2019s good for G.M. is good for America\u201d \u2014 is going to be a viewed as a signpost. So the question now is what messages can be drawn from the case, both for companies that might find themselves the target of a criminal investigation and for the public that sees how justice is dispensed for corporate wrongdoing. The government hopes the settlement, which includes a deferred prosecution agreement to false statement and wire fraud charges, will serve as some form of deterrent to keep corporations from putting consumers at risk. A statement by the Transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, asserted that \u201ctoday\u2019s announcement sends a message to manufacturers: deception and delay are unacceptable, and the price for engaging in such behavior is high.\u201d"]
["business/dealbook", "But apparently not as high for G.M. as it was for Toyota, which paid $1.2 billion for covering up defects that caused unintended acceleration in its vehicles. The G.M. case involved multiple deaths, including one in June 2013 in Quebec, when many of its engineers and lawyers were already aware of the defect yet had delayed seeking a recall of the affected vehicles. How can a lower monetary penalty be imposed on a company for actions that resulted in numerous accidents causing substantial harm? It turns out that the two criminal charges filed against G.M., which will be dismissed in three years if it complies with the settlement, have almost nothing to do with the deaths and injuries that resulted from the faulty ignition switch. The primary violation involves the company\u2019s failure to disclose to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \u201ca potentially deadly safety defect\u201d that it was required to reveal within five days of learning about it, which can lead to a criminal fine against a corporation of $500,000. A second charge for violating the wire fraud statute appears to have been added because it authorized prosecutors to seek the forfeiture of any assets tied to a violation. That allowed for the payment of $900 million, an amount that appears to have little to do with how much money G.M. actually made on the defective vehicles and more about finding a round figure that would appear to be a substantial penalty. Like the false statement count, this charge is not based on the deaths caused by defective ignition switches, but only about how G.M. misled buyers of its certified used vehicles regarding their safety."]
["business/dealbook", "The key message is not in the actual penalty or even the filing of criminal charges, but in how the Justice Department wants other companies under investigation to view the significant benefits realized by G.M. from its cooperation. Prosecutors have promised reduced penalties if corporations take a cooperative stance early in an investigation, and now they can see the tangible benefits in this settlement. The New York Times reported that Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who was also responsible for the Toyota prosecution, described G.M.\u2019s cooperation as \u201cfairly extraordinary\u201d once it disclosed the defect in February 2014. Along the way, the company demonstrated its willingness to work with the government by furnishing \u201ca continuous flow of unvarnished facts\u201d during the internal investigation and waiving the attorney-client privilege in providing information that it might otherwise have withheld from the government. The issue of disclosing privileged information is something of a sore spot for the Justice Department because of problems it encountered a decade ago when prosecutors routinely demanded waivers from companies. That approach drew severe criticism from federal judges and Congress, leading to a change in policy that prohibits prosecutors from asking a company to provide privileged information as a condition of being considered cooperative in an investigation. Just because it can\u2019t ask for privileged information does not mean the Justice Department can\u2019t reward a company that makes such disclosures on its own. The benefits of \u201cfairly extraordinary\u201d cooperation are clear by comparing how the government approached the Toyota and G.M. cases, especially in light of G.M.\u2019s conduct that was far more harmful and covered a much longer period."]
["business/dealbook", "Unlike the announcement in the Toyota case that included appearances by then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Mr. Foxx, the news conference for G.M. \u201cwas notably more subdued than the bravado\u201d shown in the earlier case. Another company that may run afoul of the government for defective automobile parts is Takata, the Japanese manufacturer, which was fined by N.H.T.S.A. for not being fully cooperative with its investigation into defective airbags. The company also rejected creating a compensation fund for those injured by its product, something G.M. did that helped earn credit for being cooperative. Don\u2019t be surprised if Takata, which is under investigation by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, eventually pays a higher fine for defective airbags than G.M. did. Another message in the settlement is that, once again, no individuals involved in the corporate decisions have been charged with wrongdoing. The statement of facts that G.M. admitted points the finger at two supervisors at the company, a safety director and a safety lawyer, as having knowledge of the defect and its role in causing accidents well before a recall was ordered. But moving from knowledge to criminal intent is, as is often the case, the seemingly insurmountable barrier to individual prosecutions. Reuters reported that Mr. Bharara pointed to the difficulties in charging any employees because of the \u201csiloing\u201d that occurs in corporate decision-making, so that \u201ca particular person may have had only partial knowledge, and contributed in a chain of actions.\u201d That is certainly not unique to G.M., although the company may have raised it to a fine art."]
["business/dealbook", "This is the continual lament in the prosecution of corporate misconduct, that the law imposes such a high threshold to proving individual culpability for corporate decisions that it is impossible to prove criminal responsibility. Thus, while the settlement points out the culpable roles played by various individuals inside G.M., none are likely to ever face criminal prosecution, although a number lost their jobs. In a recent speech about efforts to focus on individuals responsible for corporate misconduct, Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, said that \u201cAmericans should never believe, even incorrectly, that one\u2019s criminal activity will go unpunished simply because it was committed on behalf of a corporation.\u201d But as much as the Justice Department says it will pursue individuals in future investigations, the reality of the corporate structure means that most employees \u2014 especially those at the top of the organization \u2014 can operate with a high degree of impunity, with G.M.\u2019s settlement serving as the latest example."]

Mr. Pelley is seen as a key player in those plans. The president of CBS News, David Rhodes, was expected to announce the move to the staff on Wednesday morning. Earlier on Tuesday, CBS announced a management shake-up at its entertainment division, with Glenn Geller stepping down as president and Kelly Kahl, the network\u2019s longtime scheduling czar, taking his place. That move came two months after Mr. Geller went on medical leave following a heart attack. Mr. Geller was originally expected to return to the job at the end of May. Thom Sherman of the CW will become CBS\u2019s programming head and effectively the No. 2 at the network. The CW is owned by CBS and Warner Bros.

During his medical leave, Mr. Geller did not have much contact with CBS executives and did not offer opinions on the final schedule that the network set. Mr. Geller took over the job in September 2015. CBS finished this season as the most-viewed network for the 14th time in 15 years and gained some momentum from its new drama \u201cBull.\u201d But the network also fell to third place in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, which is of paramount importance to advertisers.

He said he met with other TV executives \u201cunder very general circumstances.\u201d Ultimately, he looked within. Mr. Kahl, 50, has long been CBS\u2019s top scheduling executive and has worked with Mr. Moonves for more than two decades.

["movies", "Ms. Rees, a slight, boyish 34-year-old with a shy demeanor, was recently named breakthrough director of the year at the Gotham Awards, and the film received two Spirit Award nominations, acknowledgements of good will toward the picture in the independent film world. But \u201cPariah\u201d is important, not simply as a promising directorial debut, but also as the most visible example of the mini-movement of young black filmmakers telling stories that complicate assumptions about what \u201cblack film\u201d can be by embracing thorny issues of identity, alienation and sexuality. In addition to \u201cPariah\u201d these features include Rashaad Ernesto Green\u2019s \u201cGun Hill Road,\u201d Andrew Dosunmu\u2019s \u201cRestless City,\u201d Alrick Brown\u2019s \u201cKinyarwanda\u201d and Victoria Mahoney\u2019s \u201cYelling to the Sky.\u201d The first four made their premieres at Sundance in January, while Ms. Mahoney\u2019s effort appeared at the Berlin Film Festival in February.

["movies", "Most important, the points of view of the films expand the palette of images for black American filmmakers. Mr. Green\u2019s \u201cGun Hill Road\u201d is set in the Bronx and looks at the tension among a Latino ex-con father, his transgender son and the son\u2019s black lover. Mr. Brown\u2019s film, shot in Central Africa, uses multiple story arcs to dive into the moral abyss of the Rwandan genocide. Mr. Dosunmu captures the hustles and hardships of African immigrants working in and around Canal Street in Manhattan. Ms. Mahoney presents an autobiographical look at a family of a young woman growing up black and Irish in a quasi-suburban, quasi-hood section of Queens. Ms. Rees\u2019s film, though clearly a coming-out story, is also about the ethical evasions affecting all members of a seemingly stable African-American family. I use African-American, as opposed to black, very specifically in describing the drama at the heart of \u201cPariah,\u201d since African-American means descendants of African slaves brought to America. Black, however, casts a wider net in dealing with works that depict the lives of people from the entire African diaspora. Mr. Green, who is black and Puerto Rican, and Ms. Mahoney, who is black-Irish, tap into both sides of their ethnicity in their films, just as Ms. Rees looks at herself as both black and lesbian, reconciling the two in her work just as her protagonist does in the film. The African-American Alrick Brown\u2019s journey into the thickets of a brutal African experience and the Nigerian Andrew Dosunmu\u2019s vision of life for Africans in America represent a much needed, unromantic dialogue between blacks on both sides of the Atlantic."]
["movies", "Traditionally films made for, and often by, African-Americans have fallen within a very narrow definition of our experience. Forty years ago the notorious blaxploitation era was in full stride with crime melodramas its stock and trade. Though there was plenty of hack filmmaking then, some gifted directors (Melvin Van Peebles, Gordon Parks, Gordon Parks Jr.) helped create a worthwhile canon of films in which \u201cthe brother man\u201d consistently trumped \u201cthe other man\u201d (white authority). Many of the accompanying soundtracks (Isaac Hayes\u2019s \u201cShaft,\u201d Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u201cSuperfly,\u201d Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cTrouble Man\u201d) were more artful than the images they supported. Twenty years later, in 1991, 16 films were released theatrically that were directed, produced or written by African-Americans, a historic year that was documented in a cover article in The New York Times Magazine. (I was part of that wave. My screenwriting credits include the 1991 comedy \u201cStrictly Business.\u201d) In retrospect the films of 1991 were really quite varied: a tale of Afrocentric feminism (\u201cDaughters of the Dust\u201d), interracial love drama (\u201cJungle Fever\u201d), soul era nostalgia (\u201cThe Five Heartbeats\u201d). But it was hood movies that grossed the most at the box office (\u201cBoyz N the Hood,\u201d \u201cNew Jack City\u201d) and defined that period. If there is any historical precedent for this emerging 21st-century movement, it is a collective of black filmmakers who attended the University of California, Los Angeles, in the \u201970s, making films that existed under the commercial radar and addressed subjects from neo-realism to pan-Africanism. Among the standout writer-directors in this loose collective were Haile Gerima, Julie Dash and Charles Burnett, whose 1977 masterpiece, \u201cKiller of Sheep,\u201d has been inducted in the National Film Registry."]
["movies", "The desire to identify a new generation of black filmmakers is as important for American cinema as it is for filmmakers and audiences. Halle Berry, Cuba Gooding Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Wesley Snipes, Queen Latifah, Ice Cube, Regina King and Nia Long are among the Oscar nominees, leading men and women, and television regulars who were given their first major exposure in films written, produced and directed by African-Americans. A generation of household faces came out of these films, faces that would otherwise never have had star-making opportunities to carry a film. That these actors crossed over, often to colorblind roles in mainstream entertainment, is a testament to both their skills and the underappreciated role black filmmakers have played as talent scouts. The acclaim for the previously unknown Adepero Oduye\u2019s performance as the young lesbian Alike in \u201cPariah\u201d is typical of how black film spotlights otherwise marginalized actors. And there is a very human desire to see people on screen who resemble you, but are better looking, stronger and larger than life. It is the power of movies at their most elemental. This current mini-movement has none of the certainty about black identity that defined previous periods. Identity \u2014 the search for it, the limitations of it, its fluidity \u2014 is at the core of all these dramas. Such themes speak to a sophistication that previous generations of filmmakers didn\u2019t possess or rejected since rigid definitions of racial identity are much easier to market. Then again, none of these films have made a substantial dent at the box office."]
["movies", "So a lot rides on the reception for \u201cPariah,\u201d both as the introduction of Ms. Rees as a major filmmaker and a symbol of this incipient new wave. Certainly some of the excitement surrounding it was ignited by \u201cPrecious\u201d in 2009. Both films are small dramas about sexual issues confronting young African-American women in New York City. \u201cPrecious,\u201d Lee Daniels\u2019s gothic take on Sapphire\u2019s novel, made $63 million worldwide (on a budget of $10 million), won the screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher an Oscar for his bold adaptation, and was anointed by Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry as executive producers. The film played well to mainstream as well as black audiences, which may have emboldened Mr. Perry to direct \u201cFor Colored Girls\u201d (2010), an adaptation of Ntozake Shange\u2019s feminist play, and surely factored into the marketing strategy for this year\u2019s black-women-theme blockbuster, \u201cThe Help.\u201d That\u2019s not to suggest that \u201dPariah\u201d subscribes to any kind of formula. There is a gentle, almost tentative quality to the journey of Alike (subtly played by Ms. Oduye) that is very much a reflection of Ms. Rees\u2019s personality. This highly autobiographical film began as a feature script in 2005, became a much-lauded short and was expanded back into a feature, with the support of a bevy of executive producers and independent film institutions (Sundance Institute, Tribeca Film Institute, IFP, Film Independent). It was shot in 19 days in and around Brooklyn."]

In this encounter across chasms of difference, Ms. Hassan embodied the vital role that dozens of Muslim chaplains like her are playing at colleges and universities throughout the nation. These chaplains serve as doors that open two ways \u2014 welcoming and integrating Muslim students who fear hostility at a time of rising Islamophobia, and normalizing Islam to non-Muslim students who have absorbed a narrative of it as an oppressive and violent religion. \u201cMy role is to help students negotiate this multifaith, diverse environment,\u201d said Ms. Hassan. \u201cI\u2019m going to give them a tool for when they go out of this institution, so they know how to be respectful of others. A lot of times, people are afraid even to ask the questions of people who are different. So I say, begin with friendship. Start by saying hello.\u201d Across the United States, nearly 40 Muslim chaplains serve private universities, according to Abdullah Antepli, the chaplain at Duke University and a leader in the national association of Muslim chaplains, which also includes those serving in hospitals, the military, prisons and various community settings. (For reasons of church and state separation, public universities cannot pay for clergy of any kind, although a Muslim chaplain at the University of Michigan is supported by private donations.)"]
["us", "Virtually all these chaplains have been hired since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. In their polarizing aftermath, the chaplains both chose and were compelled to become cultural and religious interlocutors. For non-Muslims, each one of those chaplains provided a face, if not the face, of the \u201cummah,\u201d or global community of Islam. \u201cIf you have a Muslim among the Jews and Christians and Buddhists and humanists, you get better integrated into the life of the school,\u201d said Heidi Hadsell, the president of Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, which has a program to train Muslim chaplains. \u201cThey act as advocates for Muslim students, but also a bridge to other communities. And that\u2019s critically important. It\u2019s a way of people on campus knowing a Muslim.\u201d There is probably no college that stands more astride the religious divide than Augsburg. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and has traditionally attracted the vast majority of its students from white Protestant denominations. Yet its campus directly abuts the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood that is the epicenter of Minnesota\u2019s population of 31,500 Somali Muslims. Perhaps nowhere else in the United States does a hockey rink sit so close to a halal meat market. With the growth of Minnesota\u2019s Somali population over the past quarter-century, the most common national news from the area has concerned the dozens of young men who joined the Islamic State or the Shabab militant group \u2014 or were apprehended trying. In September, a Somali man shouting \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d stabbed 10 people at a shopping mall in St. Cloud, 65 miles from Minneapolis, heightening fears of homegrown terrorism."]
["us", "Such explosive events, though, obscure the less dramatic assimilation of Somali immigrants here. One serves on the Minneapolis City Council. Another won a seat in the state legislature on Election Day. As of 2006, Somalis in Minnesota owned 600 businesses and had $164 million in buying power, according to a report by the American Immigration Council, and those numbers have certainly increased in the subsequent decade. So when  Paul C. Pribbenow became president of Augsburg in 2006, he looked to the Somali community for prospective students. Having written his doctoral dissertation about Hull House, Jane Addams\u2019s landmark settlement house in Chicago, Dr. Pribbenow conceived of Augsburg as the \u201c21st-century equivalent.\u201d As he recently put it: \u201cWhat does a settlement house do? It listens to neighbors and learns how to be a neighbor.\u201d With a student body of about 2,500, Augsburg\u2019s Muslim enrollment increased to 101 in 2016 from 11 in 2007. Ms. Hassan, in the graduating class of 2012, was one of those students. Her family fled Somalia\u2019s civil war in 1991 and lived in Ethiopia and Kenya for several years before she came to Minneapolis in the care of her grandmother. Equipped with a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology and international relations, Ms. Hassan went to work for an interfaith community-organizing group in St. Paul. Augsburg, meanwhile, got a harrowing reminder of its lingering gaps in meeting the needs of Muslim students when one was shot and killed near campus in 2008. The college pastor, the Rev. Sonja Hagander, realized to her shame that there was no Muslim religious figure on campus to help students grieve. As a Lutheran, she felt almost an impostor in the role."]
["us", "So when Augsburg created a position of Muslim student program associate, Ms. Hassan applied and was hired in August 2015. In the role, she addresses classes, organizes service projects, leads field trips to local mosques and started a service for Friday Prayers, known as jummah, on campus. She also makes sure there are plenty of Doritos when members of the Muslim Student Association turn up for their meetings. For Ms. Hassan, such efforts are necessarily person-to-person. If a Christian student like Ms. Blom represented one vector of her outreach, then Mohamud Mohamed typifies the other. The son of Somali refugees, he memorized the Quran by age 13 and began teaching in a weekend madrasa a year later. His default position before he went to college was to assume that the most rigorous version of Islam was the most genuine. At Augsburg, Ms. Hassan utilized Mr. Mohamed\u2019s religious training to have him, rather than an outside imam, lead Friday Prayer. She also nudged him to move the sermons away from fire and brimstone and toward issues of social justice, such as the Black Lives Matter movement. As a result, the prayer service has begun to attract some Christian and atheist students for its political message. And in at least one small way on one campus, Islam itself has been demystified and defanged. \u201cThey feel like there\u2019s no more mystery about it,\u201d Mr. Mohamed, 19, said of non-Muslim students. \u201cIt\u2019s not some secret ritual. It\u2019s a way for us to be ambassadors for Muslims.\u201d"]

Sergeant Tuozzolo, 41, was a father of two and a 19-year-veteran of the Police Department who had spent the past 10 years assigned to the 43rd Precinct, which covers a large part of the southeastern Bronx. At a news conference at the hospital, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, stood with a line of grim-faced local officials. \u201cThe city is in mourning, and the family of the N.Y.P.D. is in mourning,\u201d the mayor said.

The suspect, Mr. Rosales, was believed to have lived in Brentwood in Suffolk County, where he had been arrested 17 times, Mr. O\u2019Neill said. The trouble started on Friday afternoon, the police said, when Mr. Rosales forced his way into his estranged wife\u2019s apartment on Beach Avenue. Their 3-year-old son and a 50-year-old woman were present at the time. The night before, the police said, Mr. Rosales followed his wife in a car on Tremont Avenue but disappeared before the officers the woman had summoned could arrive."]

Responding to the call, the two sergeants and a rookie officer pursued Mr. Rosales to a dead end, about half a mile away from the apartment, near the intersection of Noble and Bronx River Avenues, the official said. Mr. Rosales\u2019s car mounted the curb in an effort to turn around but was blocked by a truck on the street, another official said. The police car bumped into Mr. Rosales\u2019s, at which point the three officers got out to confront him. Surveillance video caught what happened next: It shows the two sergeants with their guns drawn approaching Mr. Rosales in his car. There is no audio, but officials said the officers were probably ordering him to step out of his vehicle. The video captured Mr. Rosales shooting Sergeant Tuozzolo, and the rookie and Sergeant Kwo firing at the suspect. Sergeant Tuozzolo was shot with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at close range, the police said. It had been about two minutes since the 911 call. Sergeant Kwo suffered a bullet graze wound to his leg as he and the other officer fired, the official said. It was the rookie officer\u2019s third day on patrol, said Patrick J.

["world/europe", "Prosecutor Asks for Charges Against Dominique Strauss-Kahn to Be Dropped - The New York Times PARIS \u2014 A prosecutor asked a criminal court in Lille, France, on Tuesday to drop charges against the former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, saying there was not enough evidence to convict him of procuring prostitutes, according to news reports. The case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn already appeared to be falling apart, after five of the six plaintiffs retracted their accusations against him on Monday, citing a lack of evidence that he intended to break the law. Mr. Strauss-Kahn has consistently said that he did not know that the women at sex parties he attended were prostitutes. Prosecutors had accused him of participation in an international sex ring that extended from Lille to Paris and Washington. The prosecutor had earlier suggested that the case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn was weak, but he was overruled by investigating judges. While the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation demonstrates how hard it would be to convict Mr. Strauss-Kahn, under French law the decision ultimately rests with the three judges in the case. A verdict is not expected for several months. If convicted, Mr. Strauss-Kahn could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of more than 1.5 million euros, or $1.7 million. But most legal experts believe Mr. Strauss-Kahn will be acquitted."]
["world/europe", "The testimony during the trial often bordered on the burlesque, and featured a cast of characters including a sex club owner, former prostitutes called Mounia and Jade, and a former police chief. At the nexus of the sex ring, prosecutors said, was the faded and kitschy glamour of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, which features gilded statuettes, Louis XVI furniture and palatial suites. Orgies attended by judges, journalists and power brokers were said to have taken place at the hotel. Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was once considered a favorite to become president of France, was accused, along with 13 other defendants, of aggravated pimping, and of using friends to obtain prostitutes for elaborate sex parties. Mr. Strauss-Kahn testified during the trial that he was too busy trying to deal with the ailing global economy to organize orgies. He said he attended such affairs at most four times a year. The trial signaled a new humiliation for Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was forced to resign as head of the I.M.F. in 2011 after he was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. Those charges were later dropped, and a lawsuit was settled. Buffeted by scandals, he was banished to the political wilderness. During the trial, Mr. Strauss-Kahn testified that he would never have taken the risk of knowingly attending orgies with prostitutes, given his standing and his political aspirations. Moreover, he argued that libertinage, or attending sex parties involving multiple and consensual partners, was an age-old practice and a matter of private taste."]
["world/europe", "The French daily Le Monde noted this week that the chief judge had followed through on his pledge not to turn the court into an arbiter of public morality. Others, however, said the case had rightfully exposed Mr. Strauss-Kahn\u2019s moral failures and a lack of judgment that made him unsuitable for higher office."]

The lore grew to the point that ghosts were rumored to inhabit the building. The opening of the new stadium in 2009 brought along a different atmosphere, more corporate, less rowdy, and gradually, it seems, Yankee Stadium has lost some of its intimidation. The Yankees carried a lowly 18-23 record at home into the All-Star break this season. If they were going to contend in the second half, Manager Joe Girardi had said, the Yankees would need to turn the Stadium into the imposing place that it used to be. They appear on their way to doing just that: With a 10-6 win over the Cleveland Indians on Friday, the Yankees improved their home record to 29-27. They have gone 11-4 in the Bronx since the break and have won four of five games on their current homestand. Finally, these Yankees have turned their home park into an advantage for themselves, even if it is not yet the fearful place its predecessor was. \u201cI did expect it to even out because we feel our lineup is built for this field,\u201d Girardi said of the Yankees\u2019 play at home.

After months of fierce debate \u2014 including a brawl in Parliament that left one deputy with a dislocated shoulder \u2014 376 of the 550 deputies voted in a secret ballot to approve the constitutional amendment, allowing it to pass without a public referendum. Mr. Erdogan is certain to approve the change. The contentious amendment was proposed after Mr. Erdogan called for members of the Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, or H.D.P., to face prosecution for alleged ties with Kurdish militants who have carried out a three-decade-long insurgency against Turkey. \u201cThis is a historic vote,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said on Friday, speaking in his hometown, Rize, on the Black Sea coast. \u201cMy people do not want to see guilty lawmakers in this Parliament, especially the supporters of the separatist terrorist organization.\u201d The H.D.P. is the third-largest party in Parliament with 59 seats; 50 of those lawmakers face prosecution. Under the new amendment, they can be prosecuted for a number of charges, including some for terrorism, and will effectively be removed from Parliament. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s governing Justice and Development Party could then call early elections that would help him establish an executive presidency and consolidate more power."]

Kurdish politicians warned that their exclusion from Parliament could exacerbate tensions in Turkey\u2019s predominantly Kurdish southeast, where the Turkish state has been fighting a counterinsurgency campaign against the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., since the group ended a cease-fire last July. \u201cTaking Kurds out of politics and shutting down the political channels to resolve this conflict will only disenfranchise Kurdish youth further and push them toward a radical path in the fight toward great autonomy,\u201d said Kubra Demir, a Kurdish activist in the southeastern city of Sirnak."]

["sports", "Sports of The Times; For Collins and Dilfer, a Matter of Faith - The New York Times TO take his team to the Super Bowl, a quarterback needs more than an arm and a head, more than a physique as firm as a suit of armor to absorb the pounding. Maybe more than anything else, he needs faith. Not just faith in himself, but the faith of his teammates. Kerry Collins found that faith as the Giants were about to go to training camp last summer after a dismal 7-9 record in 1999. ''Some of the guys were saying, 'Kerry's our leader now,' '' he recalled. ''That made me believe I could be that quarterback for 'em.'' Trent Dilfer noticed the Ravens' faith on Nov. 12 after throwing an interception that Tennessee returned for a touchdown and a 23-17 lead. ''Ten guys were looking back at me in the huddle, knowing we were going to do something special in the next two and a half minutes, and we did,'' he said, alluding to a nine-play drive for a 24-23 victory on his 2-yard touchdown pass. ''I never had that in Tampa. I had eight or seven or one,'' he added, smiling. ''Mike Alstott always believed in me.'' Dilfer had been hooted out of Tampa as a 1994 first-round draft choice who flopped. Collins had been run out of Carolina and New Orleans as an alcoholic, a racist, a quitter and an incompetent passer."]
["sports", "Now they're the quarterbacks in tonight's Super Bowl XXXV for the only teams that pursued them as the free agents nobody else wanted. Collins reformed himself and reunited the Giants' offense with the defense in his second season after signing a four-year, $16.9 million contract. Dilfer joined the Ravens last summer as a backup. And each understands the other. ''We've allowed adversity to sharpen us, to make us stronger, and to make us better football players,'' Dilfer said. ''More important than that, and Kerry has said this, it's made him a better person. I'm also going to use football because it's a great opportunity to develop character traits and life skills that will be priceless when I'm done with this game.'' Collins got to know Dilfer when they appeared together at various National Football League functions. ''We're definitely friendly and I really respect what Trent's done,'' Collins said. ''Maybe it took getting released for us to learn some things. I know he had a hard time in Tampa, and you've got to respect a guy who is able to turn it around in another place and do the things he's done this year.'' What Dilfer did, with the help of the Ravens' dominating defense, was to supply enough offense for a 10-1 record as a starter through the playoffs after Coach Brian Billick nursed him along."]
["sports", "''We had a hodgepodge of new players that didn't really know each other that well,'' Dilfer said. ''The genius behind Brian's coaching job this year is that his focus has been far more on developing the chemistry of the team than developing better plays. It always comes back to chemistry, to unity, to things which, as I play this game longer, I think are far greater than skill or schemes.'' One of those new players is Shannon Sharpe, the tight end who had earned two Super Bowl rings with the Denver Broncos. In the playoffs Dilfer collaborated with Sharpe for two long touchdowns on two short passes. ''Trent understands the game too well not to be a good quarterback,'' Sharpe said. ''He doesn't have all the physical tools; he'll tell you that. But what he does have is an understanding and a knowledge of the game, and he's willing to pay the price. I'm so happy for him. The Bucs gave up on him in Tampa, and guess where we are now? At their home.'' After the Ravens' team picture was taken Tuesday at Raymond James Stadium, where a huge buccaneer ship is perched behind one end zone, Dilfer sat in the stands and took in the scene. ''It was like one of those movies with flashbacks of all different memories, most of them good,'' he said the next day. ''Looking up and seeing where my family and close friends used to sit. I looked at the end zone where the kids were that I paid to have go to games. For the first time I thought, 'Wow, this is kind of cool.' I got caught up in it for a little bit, then I had to get focused on the Giants.''"]
["sports", "Collins talked openly all week about being a recovering alcoholic, even about the racial slur he uttered at Carolina. ''In some strange way in my drunken mind,'' he said in his forthright manner, ''I thought it would build camaraderie.'' Instead, it built resentment that followed Collins to New Orleans and to the Giants until he changed his lifestyle. ''I didn't want to look back in 30 years,'' he said, ''and say I had a unique talent and I didn't get enough out of it.'' At the Super Bowl news media sessions, Collins openly and easily answered questions about his troubled past. ''With the world getting a chance to get to know what kind of person Kerry is,'' wide receiver Ike Hilliard said, ''what he did in talking about his past was big because a lot of people had their stereotypes on him. He's a great guy and I love playing with him. He's done a great job for us.'' But for all the faith that their teammates have in Kerry Collins and Trent Dilfer now, only one will be a winning quarterback tonight. In the Super Bowl, that's a cruel article of faith."]

["science", "OBSERVATORY - The New York Times A Salamander Trove The year 151 million B.C. (give or take a couple of hundred thousand) was a bad one for salamanders. Specifically, it was a bad year for salamanders at a lake in northern China. There they were, frolicking in their own little Late Jurassic park, when a volcano erupted, burying them in hot ash. But that catastrophic event created a trove of salamander fossils unlike any ever seen. More than 500 specimens, some with rare impressions of soft tissues, have been uncovered. They are the earliest salamanders ever found, and because they cover all growth stages and include detailed anatomical features, they offer scientists clues about salamander evolution. The fossils show that salamanders probably originated in Asia and spread to Europe and North America, scientists from the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Chicago reported in the journal Nature. They base this in part on bone structures the fossils share with some of the most primitive of modern salamanders, which are found almost exclusively in Asia. Amphibians in Trouble Recent times have not been kind to amphibians either, although in a less cataclysmic way. Experts have become concerned about declines of amphibians in many parts of the world. The exact causes are unclear, although disease and increased exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun have been implicated."]
["science", "Among the amphibians in trouble is the western toad, found from the Rockies to the Pacific. Its eggs, which are laid in shallow lakes and ponds, can suffer a high mortality rate due to a fungal infection. Previous studies had provided evidence that the eggs were made more susceptible to infection because of the stress caused by higher ultraviolet exposure -- a result, the studies suggested, of ozone depletion. But in a new study in Nature, researchers from Penn State and Oregon State have now tied the decline of the western toad to that old nemesis, global warming. The researchers, who studied toad eggs in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest, made an elegant series of connections. First, they found that the eggs did indeed become more susceptible to infection due to increased exposure to ultraviolet light. But the increased exposure, they found, was not linked to the ozone layer, but to the fact that the eggs were in water that had become shallower -- with less water above them, more ultraviolet light gets through. The researchers linked the shallower water to changes in precipitation patterns. And those changes were linked to the warming of the Pacific and changes in patterns of El Ni\u00f1os and associated events. The researchers say the work has implications for other amphibians that breed in upland lakes and shows the interaction of global climate processes with local ecological changes.

["science", "Females and males are different. Additional proof of this is hardly needed, but here's some anyway: male and female wandering albatrosses are aerodynamically different, and as a result tend to hunt for food in different areas. That's the conclusion of a study of albatross body structure and feeding patterns by biologists at the University of California at Santa Cruz and published in the journal Functional Ecology. The scientists found that male albatrosses have higher ''wing loading'' (more weight for a given amount of wing area) and thus require higher winds to stay aloft for long periods (wandering albatrosses usually ride the wind, without flapping). So males tend to forage in extreme Southern latitudes, among the windiest places anywhere. Females, on the other hand, tend to forage in calmer, more tropical latitudes. Fledglings, the researchers found, have even lower wing loading and forage even farther north. They suggest that this gives the young birds a chance to hone their flying skills before they need more wind to stay aloft."]

The two presidents, meeting at the Revolutionary Palace for the first such official contact between their two governments in more than a half-century, engaged in a frank and at times awkward exchange with each other and reporters. Mr. Obama at turns prodded Mr. Castro to submit to questions during an extraordinary 55-minute news conference.

Much of the state was deluged with rain as Irene blew through on Sunday afternoon, with the southernmost counties affected first. Several feet of water flooded downtown Brattleboro during the afternoon, and smaller towns in Windham and Bennington Counties faced \u201ccatastrophic\u201d flooding in some neighborhoods, said Gov. Peter Shumlin. Mr. Shumlin said that the problems would spread overnight and on Monday, as rivers that were swollen even before the storm spilled over and threatened low-lying towns through much of the state. The state capital, Montpelier, is on the Winooski River, which was expected to crest at 20 feet overnight, placing it at particular risk. William Fraser, the town manager, said in a statement that all the streets downtown were expected to flood overnight. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a long haul here ,\u201d Mr. Shumlin said. Parts of Waterbury were being evacuated on Sunday night, and serious flooding was also reported in Woodstock and Stowe. Although Vermont\u2019s waterways are prone to flooding and state officials were expecting some from Irene, Mr. Shumlin said forecasters expected the center of the storm to move through the Connecticut River Valley, which would have meant less rain for Vermont. Instead, he said, the storm moved north along the state\u2019s border with New York, unleashing far more rain than expected on Vermont."]

I want to convert more of my compact discs before moving them to long-term storage, but I find the MP3 format doesn\u2019t make for very rich-sounding audio files. What other formats can I use instead? A. The MP3 format \u2014 short for MPEG Audio Layer III, with MPEG itself short for Moving Pictures Experts Group \u2014 has been around for more than 20 years and rose to popularity around the turn of the 21st century, thanks to portable music players and internet file-sharing services. One of the reasons MP3 was used so often was that it created small, listenable audio files that took up a tenth to a quarter of the space of the original file, thanks to an audio-compression process that discards data deemed unnecessary. MP3 is known as a \u201clossy\u201d compression format because of the discarded audio data. AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), OGG (Ogg Vorbis) and WMA (Windows Media Audio) are other lossy formats. Increasing the bit rate \u2014 the number of bits per second encoded into the file when it is copied from a CD \u2014 in the settings of the audio program you are using to convert the disc can improve the sound quality of a lossy file somewhat, but the file size gets larger with the additional data saved."]
["technology/personaltech", "If you really want high-fidelity audio files, consider a format that uses lossless compression to maintain the sound quality of the original source. In lossless compression, redundant data is removed instead of actual audio information, so the file size is smaller than the original \u2014 but not as small as lossy compression can typically achieve. FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), Apple Lossless and Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless are among the common formats around. If you are considering a lossless format, make sure the files will play on the audio devices you use. For example, Apple\u2019s iPod hardware and iTunes software do not natively support FLAC files. Not all digital-audio conversion software supports every format out there either, so pick a program that meets your needs. If you just want to convert your CDs to individual digital files regardless of size and want to maintain the highest possible audio quality, you can convert tracks on the disc into an uncompressed format. AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) or WAV (Waveform Audio) are formats that do not compress and discard data. Converting a large amount of music takes time. To avoid being disappointed with the results, you may want to first test out the formats you are considering to make sure you are satisfied with the audio quality. As a Beethoven symphony may have more (and more varied) audio data than a garage-band punk single, try converting a few albums in different musical styles and genres. Then give the results a close listen before you plow into ripping your whole CD collection to digital audio files."]

(In effect, that would double the length of the first two sentences of this paragraph; those sentences, for the record, add up to 140 characters.) Twitter said the goal was to eliminate what it viewed as constraints that kept people from tweeting more frequently. One significant barrier, according to Twitter\u2019s internal research, has been the stringent limit on character count. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people tweeting,\u201d Twitter said in a blog post. It is a significant moment for the 11-year-old Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to change the social media service without alienating the people who have embraced its short format. The idea of extending the length of Twitter posts has been contentious internally, batted around among product groups that are trying to find ways to persuade people to use the service more frequently. At 328 million users, Twitter has been criticized for its inability to attract more people. Investors have grown nervous, as that slowing of user growth has  affected the company\u2019s revenue."]

Twitter is now preparing for a backlash from those who might take issue with a 280-character tweet. \u201cWe understand since many of you have been tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters,\u201d the company said. \u201cBut we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.\u201d The negative reaction was swift, however.

Those are my very reasonable demands when approaching any new book about movies and movie stars. I already know that the director Stanley Kubrick was a perfectionist. I know that Meryl Streep can do accents, that \u201cDeep Throat\u201d is an American porn classic and that, for all his saintlike labors on \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d for 12 long television seasons, Jon Cryer will forever be known to a self-refreshing population of cultists as Duckie Dale from the echt \u201980s romcom \u201cPretty in Pink.\u201d Tell me something I don\u2019t know or let me get back to rereading William Goldman\u2019s \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d where nobody pretends to know anything.

Oh no, I thought, not Little Guy Feeds Big Guy\u2019s Kittens, translated from the Italian. Yet here I am, embodying Goldman\u2019s famous \u201cScreen Trade\u201d dictum, not knowing anything. Because \u201cStanley Kubrick and Me\u201d turns out to be a weird, revealing delight. Yes, D\u2019Alessandro did, at times, see to the welfare of his boss\u2019s welter of coddled cats. He also drove Kubrick\u2019s cars, counseled his children and, one late night, fended off a plea to return to his boss\u2019s house to empty out a vacuum cleaner bag because Mr. Big could not find his wedding ring. But the accretion of details about this seemingly salt-of-the-earth working stiff and the eccentric artistic genius who paid him creates an irresistible picture of friendship, loyalty and artistic temperament. The stuff D\u2019Alessandro was asked to do was sometimes really nuts, and maybe the employee was nuts for putting up with his employer\u2019s whims. (There is no hiding his wife\u2019s displeasure at her husband\u2019s absences when their own two children were young, or at his willingness to leap, at all hours, at Kubrick\u2019s call.)

The People\u2019s Recreation Community bookstore and several others on Hong Kong\u2019s teeming shopping streets specialize in selling books and magazines banned by the Chinese government, mostly for their luridly damning accounts of party leaders, past and present. And at a time when many Chinese citizens smolder with distrust of their leaders, business is thriving. \u201cWe come here to buy books that we can\u2019t read in China,\u201d said Huang Tao, a salesman of nutritional supplements from southeast China, who picked out a muckraking volume recently about corruption among senior party leaders. \u201cThere are so many things that we\u2019ve been deceived over,\u201d he said, waving toward books on the devastating famine of the late 1950s and early 1960s, an episode that official histories have muffled in euphemisms. \u201cWe can\u2019t learn the truth, so black becomes white and white becomes black.\u201d Such publications smuggle corrosive facts and rumors into the bloodstream of Chinese political life. The contraband flow is reinforced by a flow of online publications and downloadable pirate copies. The trade shows the thirst for information in a society gripped by censorship, and the difficulties that party authorities face in trying to stifle that thirst, especially when, people in the business say, officials are among the avid readers of banned books."]

Customs officers are sometimes instructed to stop particular titles, people in the trade say, but often anything with a political edge that is discovered is scrutinized, and decisions on what to confiscate are made on the fly. Zhou Qicai, a businessman from northeast China, was lugging a suitcase stuffed with 400 copies of a Chinese-language magazine from Hong Kong into China in March when a customs officer inspected his luggage. The magazine, Boxun, had a report about court officials in his hometown who are suspected of being corrupt that he wanted to share with friends. \u201cHe took one look at the magazines and said, \u2018These are reactionary publications, they\u2019re illegal,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Zhou said.

["world", "Bitterness Follows French Chef's Death - The New York Times What killed Bernard Loiseau? Mr. Loiseau, one of the country's most celebrated chefs, was found dead beside a hunting rifle in his village home here on Monday. Within hours, France's haute society was abuzz with speculation over the reasons for his death, apparently a suicide. Mr. Loiseau's death followed the downgrading of his highly rated restaurant here by the influential and respected Gault-Millau restaurant guide and suggestions that it was in danger of losing one of the three stars awarded it by the all-powerful red Michelin Guide. Such downgrades in the past have driven chefs to desperate acts. But Mr. Loiseau, 52, was also facing falling profits and exhaustion, his associates say. ''We don't know why he did it,'' said a red-eyed St\u00e9phanie Gaitey, his assistant, sitting in a corner of the lush, rustic restaurant Mr. Loiseau bought in 1982 on what was once the stagecoach route between Paris and the south of France. But Paul Bocuse, France's most famous chef, was quick to point the finger at the country's restaurant guides, whose ratings can make or break a culinary establishment -- particularly one in an out-of-the-way corner of the country like Mr. Loiseau's H\u00f4tel de la C\u00f4te d'Or. ''Bravo, Gault-Millau, you have won,'' Mr. Bocuse was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper Le Parisien. He said Mr. Loiseau had been distraught over Gault-Millau's downgrade when the two men spoke by telephone on Sunday. Mr. Bocuse likened the country's culinary critics to court eunuchs, who ''understand how it's done, but can't do it.''"]
["world", "The death has revived a debate over the powerful guides on whose highly subjective annual ratings gourmets and gourmands depend in deciding where to spend heavily for an excellent meal. Chefs spend years tweaking their restaurants and their menus in hopes of winning a star in the Michelin Guide, whose three-star ratings mean that a restaurant is worth a journey to enjoy. ''I always told him the problem with being at the top is that you can fall,'' Mr. Bocuse said by telephone today. ''I felt that pressure at age 40, at age 50, at age 60, at age 70. Now at 80, I'm better able to deal with it.'' Mr. Bocuse said media criticism had also taken its toll on Mr. Loiseau, but Fran\u00e7ois Simon, food critic at Le Figaro and the journalist who had been hardest on Mr. Loiseau, retorted that France's food writers are too soft on the country's great chefs. He said it is wrong to treat the three-star chefs as ''untouchable and under such economic pressure that we can't question their talent.'' He wrote earlier this year that Mr. Loiseau was in danger of losing his third Michelin star, an event that would be financially catastrophic. He started as an apprentice to the chef Pierre Troisgros in the Loire region. He became famous for his lighter style of French cooking, distinguished by sauces based on meat stock instead of cream or butter. Mr. Loiseau bought the H\u00f4tel de la C\u00f4te d'Or, a onetime three-star restaurant that had fallen on hard times, in the Burgundy countryside."]
["world", "In his effort to elevate it once again to its three-star status, he expanded the restaurant and added guest rooms. He was millions of dollars in debt by the time he earned his third star in 1991. To pay off his debt, he bought three more restaurants in Paris and licensed his name to a line of vacuum-packed food and took the combined businesses public, billing himself as the first three-star chef to be listed on a stock exchange. The demand of maintaining a three-star restaurant and a publicly listed company, however, soon took its toll on Mr. Loiseau and his reputation. He had been to visit Michelin's director, Derek Brown, in November fearing that he would lose one of his coveted stars, and Mr. Brown had told him to ''be careful, stay in your kitchen and don't do too much business,'' Ms. Gaitey said. She said the tension was tremendous as they awaited Michelin's decision. Less than two weeks ago Mr. Loiseau was awarded three stars, but criticism in the news media had hurt the chef, she said. ''Journalists don't realize the weight of their words,'' Ms. Gaitey said. But she dismissed the suggestion that the press or restaurant guides were enough to drive Mr. Loiseau to suicide. Nor does she believe he was trying to escape a looming financial crisis. She said the company was sound, and though much of the staff had been compensated with stock options she denied that there was dissension in their ranks because of the company's sinking stock price."]
["world", "Still, the group's revenues hardly grew at all last year compared to the year before and was expected to report a drop in profit of as much as 20 percent for 2002. Everyone agrees that Mr. Loiseau hadn't been himself for several weeks and that he was worn out. ''We knew something was wrong with him,'' Ms. Gaitey said, but she said bleak winters in Burgundy were always difficult for him. Ms. Gaitey said Mr. Loiseau planned to close the restaurant two days a week starting next year to give himself a break. ''Maybe we thought about that too late,'' she said. ''He was always putting the bar higher and higher, and maybe one day he woke up and decided he couldn't go any higher,'' she said. ''It's so hard to stay at the top.'' Ms. Gaitey said she last saw Mr. Loiseau in the restaurant kitchen tasting dishes and talking with the sous chefs just hours before he died. ''His last words to me were, 'I'll see you tomorrow,' '' she said. The restaurant remained open Monday night as word of the tragedy quietly spread among the staff. But their resolve to keep the restaurant open dissolved today when guests came down to breakfast and found the staff in tears. ''We thought we could work, but it's too difficult,'' said Ms. Gaitey, looking around her at the empty rooms. ''He is here all around. It's so hard for all of us. We need time.''

["world/middleeast", "Syrian Alawites Divided by Assad\u2019s Response to Unrest - The New York Times BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 After Jaber Abboud, a baker from Baniyas, Syria, first lashed out publicly at President Bashar al-Assad for failing to promote real change, his neighbors ignored it. But Mr. Abboud and most of his community are Alawites, the same religious sect as the president. When the popular uprising broke out, many believed that if the Assad family fell, they were doomed. They closed ranks and turned on Mr. Abboud, boycotting his pastry shop and ultimately forcing him to leave town. \u201cThe neighborhood is split \u2014 half are dejected and subservient, the rest are beasts,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from nearby Latakia. \u201cIt is depressing to go there, it\u2019s like a town full of ghosts, divided, security everywhere.\u201d As the Syrian conflict escalates to new levels of sectarian strife, Mr. Assad is leaning ever more heavily on his religious base for support. The Alawite core of the elite security forces is still with him, as are many Syrians from minority groups. But interviews with a dozen Alawites indicated a complex split even within their ranks. Some Alawites are frustrated that security forces have not yet managed to crush the opposition, while others say that Mr. Assad is risking the future of the Alawites by pushing them to the brink of civil war with Sunni Muslims."]
["world/middleeast", "Mr. Assad\u2019s ruling Baath Party professes a secular, pan-Arab socialism, but Sunnis, who make up about 74 percent of the population, have long bridled at what they see as sectarian rule by the Alawites, who are nominally Shiite Muslims and make up only 13 percent of the population. People like Mr. Abboud say they feel stranded in a no man\u2019s land. Blackballed by their own Alawite community, they find that the Islamists who dominate parts of the armed opposition regard them with murderous suspicion. A few with opposition credentials have been killed. On the other extreme are Alawites who criticize Mr. Assad as being too soft, saying that his father and predecessor as president, Hafez al-Assad, would have quashed the threat by now. With Alawite youths dying by the hundreds to defend the government, voices are raised at funerals and elsewhere asking questions like, \u201cWhy is the government not doing enough to protect us?\u201d according to the Alawites interviewed. There were also anti-Assad chants in Alawite neighborhoods like Zahra in Homs, like: \u201cBashar became a Sunni!\u201d (Mr. Assad\u2019s wife, Asma al-Akhras, comes from a prominent family of Sunni Muslims from Homs.) Alawite-Sunni tensions reached a new peak after a spate of mass killings, particularly the May 25 Houla massacre of 108 Sunni Muslims, including 49 children. Survivors from Houla and people living near the slaughter last Wednesday in the farming hamlet of Qubeir said the attackers came from Alawite villages. The United Nations said suspicions in Houla were focused on pro-government militiamen known in Arabic as shabiha. Alawites dominate their ranks."]
["world/middleeast", "\u201cFor the first time, we began to hear directly from our Sunni neighbors that we should leave Damascus and return to our villages,\u201d said Abu Ali, 50, a real estate agent. He said that once the school year ended he expected a flood of such departures out of fear of revenge attacks. Fear of reprisals has prompted dire warnings from some Alawites that their future is on the line. Afaq Ahmad, a defector from the air force intelligence branch, posted a 10-minute plea on YouTube saying that Alawites have to stop committing collective suicide. He has gained prominence partly because Alawite defectors are rare. \u201cDoes the family of Bashar al-Assad deserve to be the leaders of the Alawites?\u201d Mr. Ahmad asked. \u201cIn the face of crimes like this, we cannot stay silent. We should stick to our religious and humanitarian principles because otherwise, history will show no mercy.\u201d Officials in the Assad government often say that its secular ideology has preserved the harmony among what it calls the \u201cglorious mosaic\u201d of Syria\u2019s many overlapping religions, ethnic groups and tribes. But its critics call that a front for Alawite domination, reversing centuries of fierce discrimination that is reflected in Syrian geography. Scorned as nonbelievers during about 400 years of Ottoman rule and forced to pay a special tax, the Alawites sequestered themselves in impoverished mountain redoubts overlooking the Mediterranean."]
["world/middleeast", "The secretive Alawite sect was born in the ninth century and braids together religious teachings from different faiths. They are not considered particularly zealous. Unlike more orthodox Muslims, they believe in reincarnation, for example, and do not consider the Ramadan fast or the pilgrimage to Mecca mandatory. They worship at home or at the tombs of saints, and they lack a clerical hierarchy. France, as the colonial power, created a separate coastal Alawite state that lasted from 1920 to 1936. With independence, Alawites were drawn to the military and the secularist Baath Party. The coup that brought Hafez al-Assad to power in 1970 cemented their control, shocking the traditional Sunni ruling class. He stocked the secret police and the military with Alawites, creating such a fear of them that Syrians talking about the sect in public called them \u201cGermans.\u201d The late president formed the elite units, now controlled by his son Maher, that are the main military force of repression. The government showed no forbearance toward its Alawite critics \u2014 they were considered traitors, often jailed for twice as long as Sunni Muslims for their role in clandestine political organizations. Now, even watching satellite channels critical of the Syrian government, like Al Jazeera, is considered treachery in Alawite communities. The intolerance of dissent means there is no uniquely Alawite opposition movement. (There is a Facebook page, Alawites in the Syrian Revolution, and the campaign to resurrect nonviolent protests involves many young, urban Alawites.)"]
["world/middleeast", "The first Alawite joined the executive committee of the Syrian National Council, the main opposition group in exile, only in April. Many others had been deterred by both the Sunni Muslim dominance of the group and concern for family members back home. In Baniyas, along Syria\u2019s roughly 100 miles of Mediterranean coast, the fate of Mr. Abboud, the baker, at the hands of the community helps to explain the reluctance. Mr. Abboud, 57, a former soccer coach, said he had been arrested three times and badly beaten. Two of his three children received death threats, neighbors tried repeatedly to set fire to his house and friends he had known since childhood avoided him. Even his three sisters shunned him. Until the uprising, the worst Sunni-Alawite vendetta came during the skirmishing between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government about 30 years ago. In the most notorious attack, Muslim extremists singled out Alawite military cadets in Aleppo for execution, letting others go free. The Alawites have never forgotten. In Damascus in the 1980s, new Alawite communities were formed to ring the capital, which the city\u2019s natives sometimes derisively call \u201csettlements.\u201d Salam, 28, a businessman, who grew up in one such area, said that early in the uprising, the government distributed automatic rifles there. \u201cThey told us, \u2018The Sunnis are going to kill you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Salam said in an interview over Skype. \u201cThey scared us. Of course some people in our community are narrow-minded; they believed them and, unfortunately, many people accepted the weapons.\u201d"]

Yet they fear seeking haven among the Sunnis, too, lest they be killed for their sect, he said. There is much talk that if the government collapses, the Alawites might withdraw back into the mountains. Others speculate that mass killings by Alawite militias are aimed at consolidating control in parts of the country that they could defend in a prolonged conflict with the Sunnis. Amid the siege mentality, however, come occasional glimmers of a different mind-set. Reem, 28, with long, curly black hair, helps organize anti-Assad rallies in Damascus. At the start of the uprising she could not show her face in her village above Tartus, she said. Eventually she went, prompting catcalls from pro-Assad neighbors. But on her most recent visit a month ago, no one cursed her activism, said Reem, who gave only one name to avoid recriminations. \u201cThey have begun to understand the real face of the Syrian crisis, that it is a popular revolution against a dictatorship, not against an Alawite regime,\u201d she said, describing the shock registered by young people in the village when she described how young Alawites, Sunnis and Druze stand together in antigovernment protests in Damascus. \u201cThey are amazed to hear that an Alawite woman without a veil and in tight jeans can demonstrate hand in hand with a Sunni woman covered in black,\u201d she said."]

Fresh off the release of its sporty Drive de Cartier last year, and the streamlined Extra-Flat version this year, Cartier seems to be having a moment. The august Parisian jeweler long associated with Art Deco elegance and money-is-no-object opulence, particularly for well-heeled women (hey, Cartier is name-checked by Marilyn Monroe in \u201cDiamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend\u201d), has become an unlikely darling of the young male watch-geek set, whose tastes typically run to brawny dive watches by Rolex and Omega. To put things in automotive terms, it is as if Rolls-Royce were suddenly trop chic among the Land Rover crowd. \u201cThe Drive manages to capture the X-factor their other watches were lacking, while still looking distinctly Cartier,\u201d said Zach Weiss, 32, the executive editor of the watch site Worn & Wound, which caters to stylish young men."]
["fashion/mens-style", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a betrayal of their image or a shift in branding; rather, it\u2019s the brand creating a product for the tastes of a newer, younger market,\u201d Mr. Weiss added. \u201cThe cushion-cased design has the reserved but glamorous notes that are quintessentially Cartier, but with a bolder, more aggressive posture. It\u2019s stylish, masculine and tasteful. It\u2019s a watch you would imagine Ralph Lauren happily including in his line.\u201d Cartier is hardly an afterthought in the world of fine timepieces. The venerable French maison, which is owned by the Richemont luxury group and manufactures its watches in Switzerland, has typically been listed as either the second- or third-biggest Swiss watch brand in terms of sales, alongside Omega, behind Rolex. Indeed, Cartier has been churning out timepieces since World War I, when it introduced the Tank, with its design cues borrowed from the Renault army tank. Seven decades later, Gordon Gekko advertised his Master of the Universe standing by wearing an 18-karat gold Santos de Cartier Galb\u00e9e in \u201cWall Street.\u201d Even so, Cartier was not necessarily the first brand opted for by young men wearing untucked oxford shirts carrying Filson bags, particularly since many of its classic models, including the Tank and the Santos \u2014 even those in men\u2019s sizes \u2014 have become must-haves for female Wall Streeters and fashion editors. \u201cDespite being undeniably sophisticated, they lack the cool factor found in Speedmasters, Submariners and Carreras,\u201d said Mr. Weiss, referring to classic macho sports watches by Omega, Rolex and Tag Heuer, respectively."]

The brand made a new commitment to haute horlogerie starting in 2008 with the introduction of the Ballon Bleu Flying Tourbillon housing Cartier\u2019s first in-house movement, also its first caliber to bear the prestigious Geneva Seal denoting high craftsmanship. Cartier has continued to push the envelope with ultra-high-end watches for collectors such as the Rotonde De Cartier Minute Repeater Mysterious Double Tourbillon, priced at $450,000, which was released at S.I.H.H. in January.

Mr. Harris started by crafting the headline: \u201cBREAKING: \u2018Tens of thousands\u2019 of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.\u201d It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his \u201crigged\u201d meme. \u201cI had a theory when I sat down to write it,\u201d recalled Mr. Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader. \u201cGiven the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump\u2019s talking points people would click.

As Mr. Trump takes office this week, the beneficiary of at least a modest electoral boost from a flood of fakery, Mr. Harris and his ersatz-news website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, make for an illuminating tale. Contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his secret authorship of ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, he was wary at first, chagrined to be unmasked. \u201cThis topic is rather sensitive,\u201d Mr. Harris said, noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation. But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue. He seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully.

The ballot box story, promoted by a half-dozen Facebook pages Mr. Harris had created for the purpose, flew around the web, fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that Mrs. Clinton was going to cheat Mr. Trump of victory and who welcomed the proof.

That was a sizable share of the $22,000 an accounting statement shows he made during the presidential campaign from ads for shoes, hair gel and web design that Google had placed on his site.

But as other seekers of clicks discovered, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were far more fervent than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. In late October, with the inevitable end of his venture approaching, Mr. Harris sought an appraisal for the web domain that by then had vaulted into the web\u2019s top 20,000 sites. An appraiser said that given the traffic, he could probably sell it for between $115,000 and $125,000. But Mr. Harris made a costly mistake: He decided to wait.

["arts/television", "It\u2019s part of a veritable \u201cWolf Hall\u201d industry here. Ms. Mantel won the Booker Prize in 2009 for her first Cromwell novel, \u201cWolf Hall,\u201d and then did it again in 2012 with a sequel, \u201cBring Up the Bodies,\u201d resulting in huge book sales and a great deal of buzz when Mike Poulton adapted them for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The two productions, named after each book, have played to packed houses in Stratford-upon-Avon and the West End for the past year and \u2014 in an odd moment of Tudor takeover \u2014 will open on April 9 at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway just a few days after the television series begins. \u201cI think what we are setting out to do is very different,\u201d said Mr. Kosminsky, a veteran television director who worked with Mr. Rylance on the television drama \u201cThe Government Inspector\u201d in 2005. \u201cI think what Peter Straughan has tried to do is darker and more serious in its intent; he has gone for the political jugular.\u201d Asked whether the show was an attempt to reassert British mastery of long-form television after the recent dominance of American series, Mr. Kosminsky laughed. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all thought we were making a serious drama, which would play to devotees of the book. Nothing prepared us for the response that it has had. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting it to be a Trojan horse in the American drama market.\u201d"]
["arts/television", "Mr. Kosminsky added that the series is nonetheless an important gambit for the BBC, whose royal charter is up for renewal and whose system of funding is being questioned ahead of a general election. \u201cHere comes this series, based on two Booker Prize novels with magnificent actors and a substantial investment of time and money,\u201d Mr. Kosminsky said. \u201cThe BBC is saying, this is the kind of thing only the BBC can do.\u201d After the series was broadcast in Britain, there was exhaustive media coverage discussing everything from Tudor economics to fashion, and engendering a predictable amount of historical debate. \u201cThere\u2019s an important distinction to make,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, best known for playing Nicholas Brody in the series \u201cHomeland.\u201d Sitting on the lawn in full big-shouldered costume, looking every inch the handsome, charismatic and still-trim monarch he plays in the series, he added: \u201cWe are not telling Tudor history; we are creating \u2018Wolf Hall\u2019 from novels, which are already a rereading of Tudor history.\u201d The apparently inexhaustible appetite for versions of Ms. Mantel\u2019s story is partly the result of Britain\u2019s perpetual fascination with the Tudor dynasty but is mostly testament to her vividly original reading of the period: Henry\u2019s desperation for a male heir, the break with the Roman Catholic Church, the beginnings of Protestantism, the dissolution of the monasteries and the eventual execution of Anne, the point at which the second book ends. (Ms. Mantel is writing a third installment, \u201cThe Mirror and the Light,\u201d which will chronicle the last four years of Cromwell\u2019s life.)"]
["arts/television", "All these events are mediated through the perspective and personality of Cromwell, usually depicted by historians as an unscrupulous and cruel power-monger, but here given a far more enigmatic profile as Ms. Mantel\u2019s narrative follows his rise from blacksmith\u2019s son to heights of power second only to the king. As Cromwell frees his master from his marriage to Catherine of Aragon so that he may marry Anne Boleyn, then orchestrates her downfall, he emerges as clever, witty and urbane, multilingual, inexhaustibly energetic and a master of the dog-eat-dog political chess game that is Henry\u2019s court. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary job for me,\u201d Mr. Rylance said after shooting multiple takes of a confrontation with an ailing Catherine of Aragon (Joanne Whalley). \u201cThere are about 70 or 80 scenes per episode, and I\u2019m in most of them. The difficulty is that you are playing a character who never reveals what he is thinking. So you can\u2019t compromise his expressionlessness, but you have to convey what might be going on for him.\u201d Although the series has arrived after the plays, Colin Callender, a former president of HBO films whose production company Playground produced the series (with Company Pictures, \u201cMasterpiece\u201d and BBC Two), began negotiations to secure the rights in 2012.

["arts/television", "\u201cI thought that the way Hilary had reinvigorated the historical novel showed a way to blow the cobwebs from the historical TV drama,\u201d Mr. Callender said in an interview before a February screening of the final episode at the BBC in London. \u201cFor audiences who are fascinated by complicated moral lines, characters like Tony Soprano or Kevin Spacey\u2019s politician in \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d there was something quite wonderful here.\u201d To adapt the novels, Mr. Callender approached Mr. Straughan, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for the film adaptation of John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s \u201cTinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\u201d Mr. Straughan\u2019s achievement in condensing the thousand-plus pages of the two Mantel novels into a six-hour production surpassed all expectations. \u201cHe has reduced it in the way a good maker of bourbon would,\u201d Mr. Rylance said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly barrel strength.\u201d Mr. Straughan said that early in the adaptation process he decided to structure the script around the idea of Cromwell\u2019s revenge on those who brought about the downfall of his mentor, Cardinal Wolsey. \u201cWhen you\u2019re adapting something with this kind of scale, you are looking for a spine that will help you make decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt instinctively that this would help to understand Cromwell, the long game he is playing, the concessions and moral compromises he must make. And then, when the field is clear, he is left in plain sight of the king, which becomes dangerous.\u201d Ms. Mantel, he said, was \u201cvery open\u201d to the idea. \u201cThe good writers understand that a slavish adaptation is going to make poor drama,\u201d he said."]

(The broadcaster contributed the major part of the series\u2019s roughly $15 million budget.) Mr. Rylance, who has won three Tony Awards, has done relatively little film or television work and isn\u2019t well-known to a broader audience.

["arts/television", "\u201cIt was very courteous of them,\u201d Mr. Rylance said, adding that the choice of director had been crucial to him and that he had suggested Mr. Kosminsky, who has mostly directed films on political and social topics, but Mr. Rylance pointed out that \u201cpolitics and the way political power is exercised\u201d are precisely the subject of \u201cWolf Hall.\u201d Mr. Kosminsky said he was attracted to Ms. Mantel\u2019s interest in the changes in the Tudor era that now underpin modern society. \u201cThe start of the evangelical movement, the campaign to have an English Bible in each church, the beginnings of the English Civil Service, the limits of the absolute power of an absolute monarch and the beginnings of a representative parliament: Hilary confronted these issues head on rather than skirting around them as backdrop to a love affair,\u201d he said. His approach to filming, he said, was to let Mr. Rylance\u2019s Cromwell be the audience\u2019s guide. \u201cWe had to find a way of showing this was Cromwell\u2019s story and, sometimes, his interior story, without his voice, which we have in the books,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the camera is really on Mark\u2019s shoulder. You look at people with him, you see his memories and dreams as elements that build on this sense we are seeing this in real time.\u201d The result is Tudor history as a form of contemporary theater rather than costume drama. \u201cOne of the great things about the books is that none of the characters know their future, and I wanted to convey that immediacy,\u201d he said."]

How do you explain the Holocaust to children? The short film \u201cThe Number on Great-Grandpa\u2019s Arm\u201d offers a simple answer: Let a child do it. Presented by HBO and the museum, the documentary captures the tender relationship between Elliott Saiontz, 10, and his 90-year-old great-grandfather, Jack Feldman, a survivor of Auschwitz. Elliott provides much of the narration in the 19-minute movie, which juxtaposes archival photographs and film clips with Mr. Feldman\u2019s soft-spoken recollections and the hand-painted animation of Jeff Scher, which, though haunting, is less grim than historical footage. Produced and directed by Amy Schatz, the film is at the heart of this museum installation. Visitors can see the documentary on a continuous loop alongside hundreds of its images, including 24 of Mr. Scher\u2019s original watercolors. Although Mr. Feldman suffered greatly \u2014 first sent to a labor camp at 14, he never saw his parents again \u2014 he seems happy to be alive, surrounded by the love of the generations that the Nazis tried so hard to erase.646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org"]

["dining", "Healthier Cereals Snare a Spot on New York School Menus - The New York Times The New York City public school system has quietly replaced breakfast cereals made by the Kellogg Company, the titan whose name is virtually synonymous with cereal, with those from a small California upstart called Back to the Roots. The switch, which follows a student taste test that began last spring, adds menu options that are lower in sugar and sodium and higher in whole grains. Coming in the nation\u2019s largest school system, and potentially spreading to other large districts that collaborate with New York in bulk purchases, it is one of the biggest signs to date of the inroads that small food companies are making into the mainstream. But the change also highlights the many hurdles facing small food companies and advocates of better nutrition, years after the federal government started pressing school districts to improve their menus. Last summer, Kellogg discontinued two Kashi cereals, Berry Blossoms and Honey Sunshine, that were on the schools\u2019 breakfast menu. But instead of replacing them with other Kellogg cereals, the schools opted to buy Back to the Roots cereals because of their better nutritional profile and organic ingredients, said Eric Goldstein, the chief executive of the Office of School Support Services, which oversees food operations of the city\u2019s Department of Education. Today, the 254,000 students, on average, who eat a free breakfast in city schools are offered two Back to the Roots cereals in addition to three more conventional choices from General Mills, Kellogg and Post Foods."]
["dining", "One 28-gram serving of Back to the Roots Cinnamon Clusters, for instance, has half as much sugar and four-fifths as many calories as the same amount of Kellogg\u2019s Frosted Mini-Wheats, which are still offered in New York schools. The Kellogg product is made of five ingredients, including the preservative butylated hydroxytoluene and gelatin, and has eight added vitamins. The Back to the Roots cereal has just four ingredients, no preservatives and no added vitamins; it is certified organic, and organic vitamins are hard to find. \u201cBreakfast is really important to us, and we\u2019re trying to get our menu to where we want it to be,\u201d said Mr. Goldstein of the school district, where all 1.1 million students are eligible for free breakfasts. \u201cIn the world we live in, though, there are so many constraints, so being able to offer Back to the Roots cereals for us is like a breath of fresh air.\u201d Public schools are under enormous pressure to contain costs and provide foods that children will actually eat, factors that make it harder to offer higher-quality foods. In 2010, Congress passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, the first significant overhaul of school meal programs in about 15 years. The law updated the nutritional standards school districts must meet to qualify for federal subsidies and all but banished soda, candy and other junk food."]
["dining", "Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said schools have made huge improvements since the regulations went into effect in 2012 and 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s not anywhere near perfect,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this is a journey toward providing healthier meals that kids will like.\u201d Mr. Goldstein said New York City spends 90 cents to $1 on food for each school breakfast, and has a hard time finding suppliers who can deliver products to fit that budget and at the volume needed. That was the challenge for Back to the Roots, which started to woo New York school officials about a year ago. The eight-year-old company in Oakland, Calif., is tiny compared with General Mills and Kellogg. And though it had landed its cereals in school lunchrooms in Pasadena and San Jose, Calif., and in Phoenix, Mr. Goldstein questioned whether the company could guarantee a consistent supply. Then there was the cost. An 11-ounce carton of Back to the Roots cereal costs $4 to $5 in stores, while a similar-size box of a Kashi cereal from Kellogg is around $3.50. \u201cProducing a food product that is fundamentally better for kids and that kids are going to want to eat at the scale and consistency needed is a huge challenge,\u201d said Sam Kass, who was assistant chef in the White House during most of the Obama administration and oversaw Michelle Obama\u2019s efforts to improve children\u2019s diets."]
["dining", "It was Mr. Kass who introduced Mr. Goldstein, an old friend, to Back to the Roots. Mr. Kass is an investor in the company through his role as a partner at Acre Venture Partners, which invests in food businesses. The next potential obstacle was students\u2019 taste buds, which have been conditioned to crave cereals containing at least six grams of sugar, or twice the amount in Back to the Roots cereals. (Many cereals in the grocery store contain 13 grams or more.) For three years, the school system has been testing foods with children of all ages and soliciting their opinions. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned the hard way that we had to stop making decisions here about what kids would eat and let kids tell us what they would eat,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201cWe don\u2019t test anything unhealthy, but within the realm of what\u2019s possible in terms of healthiness and cost, we let the kids decide.\u201d The results of those tests are sometimes surprising. Back to the Roots was convinced that its Cocoa Crisps cereal would be a home run, but it wasn\u2019t the favorite among the students. They liked Purple Corn Flakes best. \u201cThe milk turns purple, and kids love that,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. That turned into a problem last fall, when Back to the Roots had trouble finding enough organic purple corn to fill the district\u2019s order. Food companies have software to help them stay in stock in grocery stores, but Alejandro Velez, a founder of Back to the Roots, said there is nothing similar for school cafeterias. \u201cYou literally are doing calculations on the back of an envelope,\u201d Mr. Velez said."]
["dining", "The school district pays a little more for Back to the Roots cereals, but Mr. Goldstein said that is more than offset by their popularity among students, their organic ingredients and their lower sugar content. Asked for comment, Kellogg officials said only that they had discontinued the two cereals that have been replaced. Back to the Roots is among a growing number of smaller food companies looking to join school lunchrooms. Revolution Foods, perhaps the grandmother of the bunch, got its start in 2006 by providing healthier lunches made from fewer and higher-quality ingredients, an alternative to what the big food service companies that supply most school districts were offering. This year, the Plant Based Foods Association, a trade group for companies that make things like nut-based butters and cheeses and soy milks, plans to push to make school food policy more open to alternatives to meats and dairy products. Mr. Kass said he sees that effort as part of a transition that\u2019s been going on for the last several years, as the big food companies long dominant on grocery shelves are displaced by smaller, more nimble start-ups. \u201cNow these companies are able to talk to a contractor like the New York City public school system, which is not only interested in getting better food into school cafeterias, but also is willing to take a risk on a young company,\u201d he said."]

Shares of Twitter, which had stabilized on the hopes that Salesforce might still make a bid, dropped about 5 percent in afternoon trading on Friday, to $16.88. And shares of Salesforce rose about 5 percent, to $74.27. Mr. Benioff confirmed his remarks but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Kristin Binns, declined to comment. The interview all but confirms that Twitter will need to pursue a self-help plan rather than looking to a new owner that could shield it from the skepticism of stock market investors."]
["business/dealbook", "Despite its prominence as a forum for public discussion \u2014 especially during the presidential race \u2014 Twitter has still lost ground to competitors old and new. Some Twitter users have been leaving the service, and the company has found it difficult to persuade people to join. Its advertising revenue growth is also on a path toward slowing down. Twitter has been emphasizing its mission around live events and real-time commentary, stressing initiatives based on live-streaming video, like its broadcasts of some N.F.L. games. Twitter executives and the board have tried to buy more time to show that they can refocus the company on those live events and increase its appeal. During the weeks when rumors of a Twitter deal reached fever pitch, speculation swirled around potential divides within the company\u2019s board. Among those who opposed a sale, at least at first, was Jack Dorsey, its co-founder and chief executive. More recently, Mr. Dorsey had become increasingly open to selling the company. Without a deal, Mr. Dorsey and his team are more likely to face tough questions when earnings are reported on Oct. 27. Twitter executives have considered selling some units or laying off employees, as The New York Times reported last month. It could sell Vine, the mobile short-video service, or MoPub, a mobile advertising business. The investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company are advising it on its options. \u201cThere is declining advertising interest in Twitter,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cWhen you overlay that with the company\u2019s current fundamentals, you\u2019ll see very little top line revenue growth next year.\u201d"]
["business/dealbook", "At the same time, companies mooted as potential buyers had decided that Twitter at its current valuation \u2014 its market capitalization has surpassed $13 billion at certain points \u2014 was too expensive and required too much work to fix. Salesforce\u2019s investors are probably feeling some relief. For much of its 17-year existence, Salesforce has relied on acquisitions to grow, augmenting its core customer-relationship management offerings. But 2016 has proved a particularly active time for deal-making at the company. Salesforce has bought 13 companies for more than $4.4 billion. Shareholders were upset that in August, Mr. Benioff agreed to pay $582 million for a company called Quip, a maker of real-time collaboration software that had negligible revenue. But Mr. Benioff said he needed its founders to rebuild his corporate architecture for the next new things in corporate software. A bid for Twitter \u2014 a consumer-oriented company with significant challenges \u2014 represented to many investors an act of overweening ambition. At a $12 billion market cap, Twitter would have been the largest deal yet for Salesforce, which is worth $50 billion. It was Salesforce\u2019s initial takeover approach that set off the flurry of speculation about a takeover, and as recently as early as this month, Mr. Benioff telegraphed his interest in buying what he called \u201can unpolished jewel.\u201d In an interview during his annual customer conference this month, he said he was attracted to Twitter as a way for companies to field customer complaints and promote themselves, and pursued the deal in part to learn more about the current tech market."]
["business/dealbook", "Some of that may have been bluster. Mr. Benioff has often treated his company a bit like a start-up, both in his generous stock grants to employees and his single-minded decision-making. Yet many large Salesforce shareholders, including the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, sent emails and other messages to Salesforce executives voicing their displeasure. The prospect of a shareholder revolt could have proved disastrous for the company, which relies heavily on its stock for its deal-making and to pay its employees. A sustained drop in Salesforce\u2019s stock price would harm both activities. In a meeting with analysts last week, Mr. Benioff sounded unusually contrite and somewhat shocked that his impetuous style had riled his biggest shareholders. \u201cWe will think through everything, but we would never do a deal that would ever do the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at that meeting.

Still, some thorny questions remain before next summer\u2019s tournament in Canada. The most pointed one involves the law as well as soccer. Solo, widely viewed as one of the world\u2019s top goalkeepers and a complicated teammate, is scheduled to face trial next month on two misdemeanor charges of fourth-degree domestic assault. She has pleaded not guilty in a highly publicized case and has challenged a police account of the episode in June.

In a court filing Thursday, Maybrown said Solo\u2019s accusers had refused to participate in pretrial interviews.

["sports/soccer", "In light of the recent domestic violence episodes involving N.F.L. players, the Solo case has raised questions about whether she should have been allowed to participate in this regional World Cup qualifying tournament. It concludes here Sunday with the United States facing Costa Rica in the championship match. Jillian Loyden, a former backup goalie to Solo whose sister was killed two years ago in an episode of domestic violence, wrote in an op-ed column for USA Today that Solo should have been suspended. \u201cU.S. Soccer needs to send the right message,\u201d Loyden wrote. \u201cThey need to communicate that domestic violence is never O.K. and that it will not be tolerated.\u201d The case has also sparked debate about whether there is a fundamental difference between what Solo is accused of doing and the elevator punching episode involving Ray Rice, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens, which was captured on video. Bob Ford, a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer, wrote that to equate the Solo case with the Rice case \u201cis to diminish the life-and-death nature of what thousands of women face every day.\u201d In goal, Solo provides a confident, athletic presence and often plays at her best in the biggest games. But her career has often steered into controversy. Solo issued a veiled criticism of her fellow goalie Briana Scurry after being benched during the 2007 World Cup and was ostracized by teammates; received a public warning from antidoping officials after testing positive for a banned diuretic before the 2012 London Olympics; engaged in a Twitter skirmish with the American former star Brandi Chastain during those Games; and later said she was inebriated when appearing on \u201cToday\u201d after the United States won the gold medal."]

["us/politics", "The effort to repair the immigration system has attracted support across the political spectrum, including from traditional Republican allies like business, agriculture and evangelical Christians. The Senate passed a sweeping bill in June on a bipartisan vote. But lawmakers on both sides agreed that the window for action on immigration is narrow, most likely limited to the remaining months of this year, before the next fiscal deadlines, or maybe to early next spring. Mr. Boehner would like to make progress this year on immigration, a spokesman said Friday. \u201cThe speaker remains committed to a step-by-step process to fix our broken immigration system,\u201d said the spokesman, Michael Steel. But House Republican leaders are waiting to gauge the intensity of distrust of the White House among fractious conservatives in their caucus. \u201cThe president\u2019s attitude and actions over the past few weeks have certainly made getting anything done on immigration considerably harder,\u201d a senior Republican aide said. Several Republicans who had been working on immigration bills before the shutdown said they no longer believed Mr. Obama would negotiate fairly. \u201cI think what he has done over the last two and a half weeks, he\u2019s tried to destroy the Republican Party,\u201d Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, said Wednesday. \u201cI think that anything we do right now with this president on immigration will be with that same goal in mind, which is to destroy the Republican Party and not to get good policies.\u201d"]
["us/politics", "If the House takes any action, it will probably be on smaller measures that emerged earlier this year from the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. The Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, approved four bills that deal with enforcement, agricultural guest workers and high-skilled visas. A homeland security bill would tighten border security. Republican lawmakers, including Mr. Goodlatte and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, have been working on a bill to give legal status to young immigrants who came here illegally as children. But no bill has been introduced and no decisions have been made on who would introduce it, Republican aides said Friday. House Democrats predicted Republicans would be spurred on by an interest in showing skeptical voters that they can produce results. \u201cI\u2019m more optimistic because what prevailed at the end of this Republican shutdown and potential default was a clear message that this is not how you run government,\u201d said Representative Xavier Becerra of California, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Republicans who want an immigration bill were encouraged that Mr. Boehner survived the shutdown retaining the support of the conservatives who set it off; they hope the speaker will be emboldened to move on immigration legislation, which is still controversial within his conference. Many Democrats say Mr. Boehner could quickly pass a bill similar to the Senate\u2019s if he would allow a vote like the one that ended the shutdown, to pass legislation with both Democratic and Republican votes."]

["world/europe", "Russia, Light on Cash, Weighs Risks of a Heavy Tax on Oil Giants - The New York Times MOSCOW \u2014  As the gusher of oil money that underpinned the rise of President Vladimir V. Putin has dwindled in the price slump, the Kremlin has found ways to keep the economy chugging along, albeit at a reduced rate, spending down rainy day funds and cutting wages and pensions. But the budget strains are worsening as the price decline grinds along, forcing the Kremlin to look for new sources of money \u2014 freezing pensions, withholding wages, raising some taxes, selling off chunks of state-owned companies, even reportedly trimming military outlays. Things have become so tight, insiders say, that the Kremlin is considering cracking open the one piggy bank that was always considered sacrosanct, one that carries long-term consequences for the Russian economy: taxing the funds that oil companies need to invest to ensure future oil production. That move would be the oil industry equivalent of eating the seed corn. The longer the government keeps extracting cash from the crucial oil sector, the greater the damage to the country\u2019s future economic prospects, even if oil prices rebound. \u201cThe situation is very serious,\u201d Mikhail I. Krutikhin, an energy analyst at the consultancy RusEnergy, said in a telephone interview. He estimates that Russia\u2019s oil production, now at a post-Soviet record high of 10.8 million barrels a day, will peak at some point next year and begin a long-term decline."]
["world/europe", "\u201cThe only question is the slant of this line,\u201d he said. \u201cThe oil companies are not investing at all in exploration of new deposits because profits on these projects will only come in 10 years. Nobody will invest in these projects.\u201d This year, new taxes will cost oil companies about 200 billion rubles, or about $2.9 billion. But a far larger tax, reported by Russian news media to be up to $11 billion, is under consideration for the 2017 budget. There is little doubt that Russia needs the money now, and that the oil companies provide an enticing target. Because they are paid in dollars but conduct their domestic business in the battered ruble, Russia\u2019s oil majors have lots of cash. While globally most oil companies are deep in the red, cash reserves industrywide in Russia remain at an estimated $90 billion, a deep and tempting pool for the strapped Kremlin. But Mr. Putin, who personally oversees the energy industries, knows the dangers of taxing the companies too heavily and has long resisted the temptation. \u201cPutin faces a dilemma,\u201d Mr. Krutikhin said. The dilemma stems from the structure of Russia\u2019s oil tax system, which was designed for the state to capture the windfall of profits from high prices of oil and other commodities, rather than leaving them for the country\u2019s oligarchs."]
["world/europe", "The higher the price, the more Russia\u2019s oil companies are paid in taxes. At an oil price of $100 a barrel, for example, the companies were paying taxes of $74, according to Renaissance, a Moscow investment bank. When oil prices collapsed, the government took most of the loss in diminished tax receipts. With oil at $35 a barrel, the tax is about $17, leaving $18 a barrel for the companies \u2014 not too much less than the $30 a barrel they made at the peak. The average cost of producing and transporting a barrel of oil is about $15. Adding a tax of $17 a barrel, when oil is selling for $35, leaves a profit of only $3, a margin that rapidly shrinks as the tax rises, leaving little or nothing to show for an investment. The quandary for the Kremlin is made worse by geology because oil deposits discovered and developed in Soviet times are nearing depletion. The country\u2019s oil future, like that of the United States, lies in offshore and shale projects that are more expensive to develop. Given oil\u2019s outsize role in Russia\u2019s economy, it is no surprise that a fierce fight has erupted over tax policies. The powerful industry and its allies in the Ministry of Energy are resisting tax increases, while equally powerful factions in government want to raise taxes to maintain spending at current levels, not least on the military."]
["world/europe", "A study leaked from the Ministry of Energy, seen as allied with the oil industry, and published last week in the business daily Vedomosti, presented a doomsday scenario. Russia, the analysis predicted, could cease to be an oil power, with output plummeting to half the current level by 2035. The Ministry of Finance, in contrast, has pressed for new taxes on the oil industry as Russia prepares a revised budget for 2016, which is due in June. Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said the government was striving to keep the deficit within the legally required limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product. The ministry is considering foreign borrowing and privatizing shares in public companies, including in the national oil company, Rosneft, as an alternative to defense cuts or energy industry tax increases. Even while piling up cash reserves, however, oil companies\u2019 investment rose at a rate of 11 percent, which was lower than inflation of 12.9 percent, last year. \u201cThe response from oil companies has been they will have to cut further into investment programs; otherwise, they will not be able to bring their books into balance,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said. Lukoil, Russia\u2019s largest private oil company, trimmed spending last year on capital outlays to $9 billion, down $1.5 billion from the year before. Spending by Rosneft, the largest state company, also fell in dollar terms."]
["world/europe", "Russian companies have not broken ground on a major new field here since the Trebs and Titov, a complex of oil fields in northern Russia, was tapped in 2014 just as Western sanctions took effect and oil prices slumped. Industry lobby groups have pushed back, so far as is possible in Russia\u2019s tightly coiled political system. It would not be the first time oil entered a spiral of declining volumes and rising demands from the state. Short of cash in an oil price downturn in the late Soviet period, the Kremlin squeezed the oil industry. It was deprived of capital, at the time, for such things as imported machines. Output in what is today the Russian Federation fell to about 8.8 barrels in 1991 from about 11 million barrels a day in 1988, according to \u201cCollapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia,\u201d by a former prime minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, who argued that oil prices and not the arms race with the United States ended the Soviet Union. A diminishing role for the oil industry is not so bad for Russia, politically or economically, Yevgeny G. Yasin, a former minister of economy, said in an interview. Russia should raise taxes on oil companies even if it diminishes the share of extractive industries in the economy in future years, and shift focus to other areas of Russian strength, such as education and science, he said.

Much like those televised competitions \u2014 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cThe Voice\u201d being the national brand leaders \u2014 \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d presents audiences with a stage full of singers who, one by one, have a chance to step into the spotlight (in this case a very smoke-suffused one) and astonish us with the mighty heft and range of their voices. The through-sung score, by Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and Alain Boublil (the English lyrics are by Herbert Kretzmer), boasts a passel of throat-searing numbers that build to rousing climaxes. Theatergoers at the reviewed performance cheered as if they were indeed at a sing-off featuring fresh-faced young performers singing pop favorites with all the dazzling flourishes they could muster. As pretty much everyone by now knows, the musical dramatizes the elaborate tale of an unfortunate French guy who stole a loaf of bread and lived to regret it. The production that opened at the Imperial Theater on Sunday night, returning the show to Broadway to capitalize on the popularity of the recent movie version, gives it an update of sorts. The original London staging by John Caird and Trevor Nunn, with its famous turntable set, has been set aside in favor of a new one, directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell, with nothing spinning around except maybe the drunken revelers at the tavern. (A short-lived revival that came to Broadway in 2006, just three years after the long-running original closed, was a facsimile of that production.)"]

Casting and matters of crowd control are of paramount importance. True, the sets by Matt Kinley, augmented by his \u201cimage design\u201d drawn from the paintings of Hugo himself, seem aimed squarely at mimicking aspects of the cinematic experience. There are several atmospheric video sequences projected onto a screen at the back of the set, for example, so that we can follow Jean Valjean (Ramin Karimloo) as he slogs through the Paris sewers with the wounded young Marius (Andy Mientus) on his back. Mr. Kinley\u2019s design also features lots of distressed-looking wood sprouting beyond the proscenium to encompass the boxes that flank the stage. Scenic tweaking aside, and an orchestra shrunk to 20 from 27, this \u201cLes Miz\u201d will offend none of the musical\u2019s fans with any directorial innovations, and will give them a chance to assess how a new generation of performers meets the challenges of the score. The big winners, happily, were the actors playing the dominating roles of hero and villain: Mr. Karimloo as the bread stealer, single father, long-sufferer and future saint; and Will Swenson as Javert, dogged pursuer of said hero and general scourge to all noble causes and pure hearts."]
["theater", "Mr. Karimloo, an Iranian-born Canadian performer, has appeared mostly in the West End of London, where he has played Valjean, Marius and Enjolras in this show, and the lead in Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s forgettable (and, at least in my memory bank, forgotten) \u201cLove Never Dies,\u201d the sequel to \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d Making a sterling Broadway debut, he sets a high standard in the prologue, performing Valjean\u2019s angry soliloquy with fiery intensity and full-throttled vocalism that gradually shades into more nuanced coloring as Valjean puts behind him the grim shadows of his imprisonment and forges a new life. The highlight of his performance, and perhaps the production as a whole, is Mr. Karimloo\u2019s beautifully restrained but richly felt rendition of \u201cBring Him Home,\u201d one of the score\u2019s less thundering songs, in which Valjean sends up a prayer for Marius, who has fallen at the barricades after falling for Cosette (Samantha Hill), whom Valjean has raised after her mother\u2019s death. Mr. Karimloo\u2019s croon is as sweet as his belt is big. Mr. Swenson, who has played nice guys with big hair in \u201cPriscilla, Queen of the Desert\u201d and \u201cHair\u201d on Broadway, makes for an unusually dreamboaty Javert. (A beauty contest between hero and villain would be a tough call here.) He musters his inner sinister to snarl and glower with gusto, and his singing has both power and precision. (I liked the way Mr. Swenson emphasized an extra syllable in the word \u201cGod\u201d when he sang it at one point, as if the name of the deity naturally stuck in the throat of this vile character.) Javert has his own climactic soliloquy mirroring Valjean\u2019s opening one, in which he is forced to question his life\u2019s purpose, since Valjean\u2019s good seems to be triumphing so annoyingly over his evil. Eyes still glowing with thirst for vengeance, Mr. Swenson\u2019s Javert met his end with soul shaken, but vocal resources firmly intact."]

Mr. Mientus\u2019s Marius was on the bland side, both dramatically and vocally, and as Enjolras, the student leader of the rebellion seeking to bring forth a new day in repressive France, Kyle Scatliffe got a little pitchy at times, as they say on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d As the sweet Cosette, Ms. Hill sings and looks pretty, which is about all that is required of her."]

["health", "F.D.A. Plans New Scrutiny In Areas of Biotechnology - The New York Times Seeking to calm public anxiety, the Food and Drug Administration yesterday proposed rules that would strengthen scrutiny of several biotechnology areas: genetically modified foods, gene therapy and the transplantation of animal organs and tissues into people. The agency said it would make it mandatory, rather than voluntary, for developers of genetically modified food to subject such food to a safety review before bringing it to market. The agency also said it would make much of the information provided by the companies publicly available. The F.D.A. also issued guidelines on how food companies could voluntarily label their products as being made without genetic engineering. But it declined requests from numerous consumer and environmental groups that it require all genetically engineered foods to be labeled. Regarding gene therapy and the animal organ transplants, the agency said it planned to release data on clinical trials that it now keeps confidential, a proposal that angered the biotechnology industry. Such public disclosure, the agency hopes, will assuage public concerns that have arisen about gene therapy since the death of a teenager in a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania in September 1999. Providing more information about bioengineered crops is also expected to remove some concerns about biotech foods, officials said. ''What any product doesn't need is for there to be suspicion on the behalf of consumers that something is being slipped by them,'' Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said in an interview about the food regulations."]
["health", "But many consumer and environmental groups said the new rules do not go far enough. ''It's a baby step in what needs to be a leap toward real regulation,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit group. Ms. Goldburg and other critics said the safety review of genetically modified crops would still fall far short of the more rigorous scrutiny given to food additives. The food and biotechnology industries generally applauded the rules, which they have been advocating. The industry hopes mandatory F.D.A. review will demonstrate to consumers that biotechnology is regulated; it will not impose many new burdens on the companies because they are already notifying and providing data to the agency voluntarily. Food companies have also pushed for voluntary labeling. Mandatory labels on foods with genetically modified ingredients, they maintain, would be interpreted by consumers as a skull and crossbones. On the other hand, stating on a label that a product does not contain genetically modified ingredients could be a way to attract customers concerned about genetic engineering. ''I think you're going to see a number of companies putting on their labels 'nonbiotech,' '' said Gene Grabowski, spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America. Some companies, particularly organic or health food companies, have already started such labeling. The new guidelines, however, would impose restrictions on such labels. The agency said it would frown on use of labels that state a product is ''free'' of bioengineered ingredients because that is virtually impossible to guarantee. It would prefer labels saying that the products were not made using biotechnology. It also said that any label implying that the nonbioengineered food was somehow superior to the bioengineered equivalent would be ''misleading.''"]
["health", "It is estimated that two-thirds of the processed foods now in American supermarkets are made with genetically altered corn, soy or other crops. The F.D.A. maintains that it cannot require labeling of genetically modified foods because there is no evidence they are different in terms of safety or nutritional value. Representative Dennis Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, sharply criticized the new rules as ''purely public relations'' and said he would renew his push to enact legislation requiring mandatory labeling. The new food rules have been expected since May, when the F.D.A. announced its intentions. The agency had conducted three public hearings late in 1999 and received more than 35,000 written comments. There will now be a public comment period before the rules are made final, giving the new administration of George W. Bush a chance to weigh in. Regarding gene therapy and the animal tissue transplants, the agency said it wanted to depart from the rules requiring that information about clinical trials be kept confidential unless the organization conducting the trial allowed disclosure. The justification for this departure, it said, is that the two techniques pose a theoretical risk of viral infection to the public, not just to the patient being treated. Because it is considered so novel, gene therapy trials are regulated not only by the F.D.A. but by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health. And some information on trials is already made available through that committee. But the proposed F.D.A. rules are expected to increase the amount of data made public."]
["health", "The biotechnology industry expressed dismay. ''It's somewhat out of left field,'' said H. Stewart Parker, president of Targeted Genetics, a gene therapy company in Seattle, who added that the rules would ''make it much harder to operate in the field of gene therapy.'' Ruth Macklin, professor of bioethics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said the proposed rules could undermine the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, of which she is a member. One reason for that committee's existence, Professor Macklin said, has been to provide the public with information that the F.D.A. kept confidential."]
["realestate", "Midtown Manhattan: New Amenities and High-Rises Attract Residents - The New York Times Walking a straight line at a constant speed though Midtown Manhattan one day last month proved difficult. Office workers thronged food trucks. Tourists clustered at corners, unwilling to move until there was a proper walk signal. Noisy bottlenecks of traffic occurred like clockwork. With such clamor and commotion, it may not be surprising that New Yorkers rarely cite the central business district of the country\u2019s most populous city as their preferred residential address. But thousands actually do live amid the office towers and hotels, a number that is climbing with the opening of new luxury high-rises. And with the addition of amenities that more traditional neighborhoods take for granted \u2014 supermarkets, pharmacies, sit-down restaurants \u2014 the commercial hub may slowly be catching on. \u201cYou would go outside at 8 a.m., and businesspeople would be walking back and forth, and taxis would be honking, and it would hit you in the face: You were not living in a residential neighborhood,\u201d said Lani Azenberg, 68, of her impression upon moving there in 1979 from the Upper West Side.

Still, as exhausting as the hustle and bustle can be, this neighborhood, sandwiched between Central Park and Broadway\u2019s theaters, and amply served by public transportation, is convenient in a way that\u2019s hard to beat, residents say. And its arts legacy, however faded, they add, is also a major draw."]

The couple raised three children, all of whom now work in the performing arts, in a three-bedroom, three-bath co-op that cost $520,000 in 1989, she said. Based on available listings, it might fetch about $1 million today. If residents can still enjoy concerts at Carnegie Hall or musicals at New York City Center or learn how to paint with watercolors at the Arts Student League of New York, other cultural mainstays have been lost. In 2014, the Rizzoli Bookstore shuttered its 57th Street location, while the longtime Lee\u2019s Art Shop closed last year. Piano stores and art galleries, once prevalent, have also seen their ranks thinned. Uprooting some of those businesses have been high-rise condos called supertalls.

A major artery is 57th Street, otherwise known as Billionaires\u2019 Row, for all the deep-pocket buyers who call those supertalls home. Among the highest profile of the batch is One57, a 90-story tower from Extell Development Company that in 2015 set a record for the city\u2019s priciest deal, when a duplex penthouse traded for $100.5 million. Six years after sales began, however, it hasn\u2019t yet sold out.

In an area where investors often snap up apartments to sublet them, rentals can also be found in condos like Metropolitan Tower, Museum Tower and CitySpire. These kinds of rentals are often used as pieds-\u00e0-terre, giving some buildings a transient quality, brokers and residents say. On July 27, 113 co-ops and condos were listed at an average price of $4.6 million, according to data from StreetEasy. The most affordable was a co-op studio with granite counters and parquet floors at Carnegie House, a postwar co-op, at $365,000; the most expensive, a four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath unit at One57 with granite counters and rosewood herringbone floors, at $52 million. Despite a softening luxury market, average prices seem to be rising, though averages can be elevated by a few big-ticket deals, brokers point out. In 2016, of the 172 co-ops and condos that sold, the average was $1.88 million, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants. In 2017, in contrast, the average price of the 137 apartments that sold was $2.09 million, Mr. Miller said. Most of the rentals listed on StreetEasy last month were condo sublets, which are usually pricier than typical apartments. One-bedrooms averaged about $4,600 a month, according to the website, while two-bedrooms were $13,000."]

Cubicle workers in search of caffeine can avail themselves of no fewer than eight Starbucks coffee shops; for tourists, there are the Rue 57 brasserie and the opulent Russian Tea Room. Residents say their dining scene has vastly improved in the last few years, with such offerings as Quality Italian Steakhouse. Also energizing Midtown is Turnstyle, a year-old food hall inside the Columbus Circle subway station at the neighborhood\u2019s edge; tiny restaurants like Bolivian Llama Party, with empanada-like pastries, and Blossom du Jour, with vegan fast-food, serve their dishes there while trains rumble underfoot.

So Vesey found Pastrnak and crosschecked him back. Then he hugged his teammates. Vesey\u2019s father, Jim, a former N.H.L. forward, happened to be watching the game on television. The goal, a tap-in off a gorgeous cross-ice pass from Rick Nash, was terrific, but to his father, Vesey\u2019s response to Pastrnak was even better. \u201cI said, \u2018When he hits you, you\u2019d better hit him back,\u2019\u201d Jim Vesey said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to protect himself.\u201d Jimmy Vesey, a 23-year-old from North Reading, Mass., was the captain of the Harvard hockey team, and he won the Hobey Baker Memorial Award as the top N.C.A.A. player last season. As a senior, Vesey scored 24 goals in 33 games and sat in the penalty box for only six minutes. But it has become apparent to the Rangers that he takes great pride in being more than a prolific scorer. At 6 feet 3, 207 pounds, Vesey can be physical and punishing. \u201cI have a bigger body, and I don\u2019t mind doing that stuff,\u201d Vesey said Thursday after practice. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m looking to bring every night.\u201d Ted Donato, a former N.H.L. forward who is the coach at Harvard, said Vesey worked at becoming a better all-around player while with the Crimson."]
["sports/hockey", "\u201cNow, it\u2019s not just about whether he scores or not \u2014 a coach can trust him to be on the ice up a goal or down a goal,\u201d Donato said. \u201cHe had a commitment to becoming a 200-foot player,\u201d Donato added, referring to Vesey\u2019s defensive abilities. \u201cJimmy came in as a player who could score, but he left as a player who could score goals but also kill penalties, a guy you could use in all situations. Those kind of guys buy themselves more leeway with coaches, not just because they can score goals.\u201d Vesey was selected by Nashville in the third round of the 2012 N.H.L. entry draft but decided to go to Harvard. Nashville could not sign him in its allotted time and traded his rights to Buffalo in June. The Sabres could not sign him either, so Vesey became an unrestricted free agent. Eight N.H.L. teams, including his hometown Bruins, pursued him. Vesey signed with the Rangers because he thought they really wanted him. It was a bonus that Rangers forward Kevin Hayes is a friend since childhood. Now the two are dressing-room neighbors. \u201cJeff Gorton and Chris Drury are the ones who really did their homework on him,\u201d said Coach Alain Vigneault, referring to the Rangers\u2019 general manager and assistant general manager. \u201cThey had told me he was a good two-way player at the university level."]
["sports/hockey", "\u201cNow, whether that translates to the N.H.L., sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. But in Jimmy\u2019s case, with his skill set, his work habits, his work attitude and his smarts, he\u2019s been capable so far to settle in what we\u2019re trying to teach. He\u2019s been efficient on both ends of the rink right now.\u201d Jim Vesey would regard this as the highest praise. Vesey, 51, grew up in Charlestown, a working-class Boston neighborhood, and had a seven-year professional career, playing in only 15 N.H.L. games. Jimmy Vesey was born as his father was about to make the last stop of his career, with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the International Hockey League. He grew up with his father as his coach from the 8-and-under mites level to high school. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in the car,\u201d Jimmy Vesey said, smiling. \u201cHe taught me how to grow up and be a man. He was one of the biggest influences on me. He was definitely passionate about hockey with me and my brother, but no one really pushed us or forced us to do anything.\u201d As a coach, Jim Vesey, who is now a Boston-based amateur scout for the Toronto Maple Leafs, said he expected all his players, no matter how gifted they were at putting the puck into the net, to play hard in all zones, or else they would not play at all. Soon, Harvard called. \u201cAnd when you go to Harvard, let\u2019s face it: Harvard is not a place you go to leave early,\u201d Jim Vesey said."]
["sports/hockey", "Playing hockey at Harvard turned into a four-year project for Jimmy Vesey. The Crimson had losing records in his first two years there, but he was asked to fill many roles. Harvard qualified for the N.C.A.A tournament in his last two years but lost in the first round each time. Along the way, Donato said, Vesey \u201creconfigured his body,\u201d becoming more explosive and powerful. \u201cI think I grew up a lot in college,\u201d Vesey said. \u201cStaying four years really helped me. I grew as a hockey player and as a person. I was learning how to play within a team and how to play two ways, but maturity was the biggest thing.\u201d Vesey scored five goals in four games for a team of Rangers prospects at a pre-training-camp tournament in Traverse City, Mich., but drew praise from coaches for his ability to drive to the goal. He then won a spot on a line with Derek Stepan and Nash. \u201cWhat I like about him the most is that he gets to the gritty areas,\u201d Stepan said. \u201cHe seems to be always be in the tough areas, and that\u2019s where you score goals. That\u2019s something going forward that he\u2019s going to need to do if he wants to keep having success.\u201d Nash said of Vesey: \u201cHe\u2019s kind of got a power-forward-type style to him. He\u2019s a big guy, uses his body, but he\u2019s good with his hands, too \u2014 fun guy to play with. But you have to be able to play defense. A guy has got to learn at a young age that the offensive chances are going to come with good defense. He plays the body, so he\u2019s got a little bit of aggressiveness, too.\u201d"]
["sports/hockey", "Hockey coaches and players like to refer to that quality as bite. Vesey scored in his third N.H.L. game, a 7-4 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Oct. 17 at Madison Square Garden, then scored twice in his fifth game, a 4-2 victory at Washington five days later. With his first goal out of the way, his father said, Vesey can focus on blending in. Vesey has a bachelor\u2019s degree in government from Harvard, but asked what he would do if he could no longer play hockey, he said he would probably be a hockey coach or hockey executive. \u201cMy dad played. My older cousins played. Me and my brother played. I just liked it,\u201d Vesey said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a religion in Boston, especially in the city. It\u2019s in our blood. We grew up with it and fell in love with it.\u201d"]
["science", "How the Brown Rat Conquered New York City (and Every Other One, Too) - The New York Times Millions of them live in New York, and billions more in cities and on farms across the globe. And wherever they scurry, they wreak havoc. They devour food supplies and contaminate what they don\u2019t eat with feces and urine. They spread a range of harmful viruses and bacteria. In delicate ecosystems around the world, they threaten other species with extinction. \u201cThey\u2019ll gnaw through walls. They\u2019ll gnaw through wires. They\u2019ll destroy cars,\u201d said Jason Munshi-South, a biologist at Fordham University. \u201cThey\u2019ve managed to spread wherever there are humans.\u201d Despite their ubiquity, Rattus norvegicus, otherwise known as the brown rat, remains surprisingly mysterious. Scientists have only a hazy idea of how it went from wild rodent to unwanted human companion. Now Dr. Munshi-South and his colleagues have completed the first in-depth genetic study of brown rats from around the world. Their story has twists and turns that surprise even the experts. After spreading slowly for thousands of years, the scientists found, brown rats scampered over much of the planet in just the past three centuries. And once brown rats settle into a new city, the new study suggests, they repel all newcomers \u2014 a finding that could have big implications for our health. Dr. Munshi-South said the study emerged from a simple question: \u201cWhat is a New York City rat, and where did it come from?\u201d"]
["science", "He contacted researchers around the world to see if he could obtain DNA to compare with that of the rats he captures around New York City. To his surprise, he ended up with samples from hundreds of brown rats, from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to Brazil, from New Zealand to Japan. Instead of simply asking where New York City\u2019s brown rats came from, Dr. Munshi-South realized he might be able to figure out where the world\u2019s brown rats came from. Emily E. Puckett, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab, analyzed the DNA samples, sorting 314 brown rats from 30 countries into clusters of genetic relatives. Eventually, she was able to determine how different populations of the rats mixed together over time. Dr. Puckett, Dr. Munshi-South and their colleagues published their findings last week in Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences. The brown rat is sometimes called the Norway rat, but the new research confirms that the name is a misnomer. Instead, brown rats originated in northern China or Mongolia. Before they became our companions, they fed on wild plants and small animals on cold, open plains. Farming came relatively late to northern China, but at some point, native brown rats, finding a reliable food supply in their midst, switched to living on farms and in villages. Dr. Puckett and her colleagues can\u2019t say how long brown rats remained in northern China, but at some point, they started to expand their range. Their first migration, the study suggests, took them to southeastern Asia."]
["science", "Much later, a wave of brown rats spread northeast, into Japan and Siberia. Another emigrated west, eventually reaching Europe in what appear to have been three major arrivals on the Continent. These rats may have traveled on overland routes, or perhaps hidden on ships that sailed along the coasts of Asia and Europe. The new study suggests that brown rats were slower to spread around the globe than our other familiars, the black rat and the house mouse. Geography may be the reason: House mice originated in the Fertile Crescent, and black rats in India. Farming societies and widespread trade arose in those places much earlier than in northern China, giving the black rat and the house mouse early opportunities to travel. But in the past three centuries, the brown rat has more than made up for lost time. Brown rats in Alaska and along the Pacific Coast of the United States and Canada can trace much of their ancestry to Russia, Dr. Puckett and her colleagues found. Their ancestors may have stowed away aboard ships that traveled to fur-trapping communities in the New World in the 1700s and early 1800s. But the brown rats of Europe became the true globe-trotters. As Western European countries colonized other parts of the world, they took the rodents with them. The brown rats of New York and other Eastern American cities trace their ancestry to those in Western Europe. So do brown rats in South America, Africa, New Zealand, and isolated islands scattered across the Atlantic and Pacific."]
["science", "Even today, the ports of New York City are visited by rats from around the world. Before his new study, Dr. Munshi-South had originally suspected that the city\u2019s rats would have inherited a mix of genes from ancestors far and wide. But he and his colleagues found very little evidence of genetic mixing in New York, or in the other cities they studied. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of recent migrants arriving and reproducing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some force keeping them out.\u201d Michael Kohn, an evolutionary biologist at Rice University, said the difficulties that brown rats now encountered in cities was intriguing. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to get there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to get in.\u201d The reason may be that brown rats are territorial and just plain mean, as Dr. Munshi-South often is reminded when he inspects the specimens caught in traps. Many of them bear the marks of fights with other brown rats. \u201cThey\u2019ve got scars, they\u2019re missing eyes, they\u2019re missing part of their tail,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir life is fairly brutal.\u201d The researchers now theorize that the first brown rats to show up in a city rapidly fill it up. Later, when bedraggled latecomers tumble out of ships in the city\u2019s ports, the stronger residents rebuff them. To Dr. Munshi-South, that\u2019s good news. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that a lot of diseases are going to be entering cities on rats walking into the local rat population,\u201d he said."]

["books", "Poetry in Brief - The New York Times Different Hours By Stephen Dunn. Norton, $22. Stephen Dunn's poetry is strangely easy to like: philosophical but not arid, lyrical but rarely glib, his storytelling balanced effortlessly between the casual and the vivid. But don't mistake that ease for lack of staying power. Dunn's Pulitzer Prize-winning 11th collection, ''Different Hours,'' is largely grounded in the present day -- several poems refer to the millennium and news events such as the Oklahoma City bombing -- but it also has an out-of-time quality, like a conversation with your smartest friend during a long-distance road trip. Some of the best work here wrestles with marriage. In one poem, Dunn describes the complicated d\u00e9tente, during illness, between a man and his ex-wife: ''Each of them called it love / because precision didn't matter anymore.'' In another, he rages at his friends' divorce: ''But this is a mockery, a defeat. / My friends were perfect, perfect.'' Whatever Dunn describes, his subject is the ambiguity of human relations, the way our inner and outer worlds intersect like a magician's linking rings -- and the struggle to reconcile knowing how the trick is done with marveling at its mystery. Dunn has a gift for aphorism (''optimism is the enemy of happiness''), but his most startling ability is the way he maps out the subtle, mordant shifts of adult morality, the slippage of ''my daily mask, . . . my normal / dreamy life of uncommitted crimes.''

Robards\u2019s observation became a challenge that Mr. Shalhoub, fresh out of the Yale School of Drama, set for himself. And for 34 years on television, in movies and onstage, he kept his hands from taking refuge in the recesses of his clothing. Then he was cast in \u201cAct One,\u201d Lincoln Center Theater\u2019s staged adaptation of Moss Hart\u2019s 1959 theatrical memoir. In it, Mr. Shalhoub plays three very different characters: Hart in middle age; his impoverished immigrant father; and his longtime writing collaborator and mentor, the urbane George S. Kaufman. To help with the lightning-quick role changes, Mr. Shalhoub developed a private prompt for each character \u2014 an open-mouthed Cockney \u201coy\u201d for the elder Hart; a subtle finger flick for Kaufman; and for Hart himself, a hand in his pocket. \u201cThe alarms went off,\u201d Mr. Shalhoub said, when the play\u2019s writer and director, James Lapine, suggested the gesture. Ultimately, Mr. Shalhoub rationalized the hidden hand by concluding that his Moss Hart is narrating the action rather than participating in it. Mr. Shalhoub\u2019s wife, Brooke Adams, also an actor, liked the idea. It seems to be working. Mr. Shalhoub has won fine reviews and a Tony Award nomination for best actor in a play."]
["theater/theaterspecial", "\u201cI have a lot of friends who have seen the show,\u201d said Hart\u2019s son, Christopher, who is himself a director and producer. \u201cHalf of them don\u2019t realize Tony is playing my grandfather at the same time. He just does a brilliant job of going from one character to the next.\u201d Mr. Shalhoub\u2019s success was hard fought. For starters, the role is physically exhausting. The complicated three-tier set is on a huge turntable that compels the actors to race up and down stairs around the whirligig. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell after a while where the audience is,\u201d Mr. Shalhoub said. Then, aside from juggling multiple parts, Mr. Shalhoub has to synchronize his depiction of Hart with two other actors who play younger versions of him: a 12-year-old Moss (Matthew Schechter) and a tenacious young Moss in his mid-20s (Santino Fontana) who labors with Kaufman to write his first hit, \u201cOnce in a Lifetime.\u201d \u201cWe watched each other in rehearsal, so there is an overlap of certain kinds of gestures and postures,\u201d Mr. Shalhoub said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t want to overlap too much. People change all the time.\u201d Mr. Fontana agreed: \u201cI stole a couple of things that Tony does physically as I get older, but we\u2019re very different characters.\u201d As for Kaufman, his curio cabinet of tics and idiosyncrasies \u2014 his wild sagebrush hair, obsessive hand washing, acerbic one-liners \u2014 have become Broadway lore."]
["theater/theaterspecial", "Talking about Kaufman at a restaurant across the street from Lincoln Center, Mr. Shalhoub did Kaufman\u2019s trademark wiggle of his index finger: \u201cWaving this little finger meant \u2018Hello,\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t talk to me,\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t touch me,\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Perhaps the biggest hurdle for Mr. Shalhoub was to avoid replaying the obsessive-compulsive detective Monk that he portrayed for seven years on the namesake television series, winning three Emmy Awards for his work. But Mr. Shalhoub said he did what felt right for Kaufman\u2019s character, regardless of any similarity to Monk. Besides, he said, the two characters have hugely different temperaments. Hart, who helped write \u201cThe Man Who Came to Dinner\u201d and the Pulitzer-Prize-winning \u201cYou Can\u2019t Take It With You,\u201d and directed \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and \u201cCamelot,\u201d was much more elusive. His children, Christopher and Catherine Hart, were closely involved with the production and shared reminiscences and letters from their father, who died of a heart attack in 1961 at the age of 57. Mr. Shalhoub was also able to find a rare televised interview from 1959 that Edward R. Murrow did with Hart; his wife, Kitty Carlisle; and their children. Filmed at their sprawling Park Avenue duplex, the clip shows a Hart who had journeyed a long way from his tough childhood on the Lower East Side. With the help of a dialect coach and a recording of that interview, Mr. Shalhoub was able to echo Hart\u2019s distinctive voice: \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d with a shot of Brooklynese.

The clever and self-effacing man that the middle-aged Hart presented to the public hid his rancorous childhood and crippling depression. \u201cWhatever he went through in his life, he sublimated it,\u201d Mr. Shalhoub said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t revealing any of his neuroses.\u201d Mr. Shalhoub\u2019s next project does not sound quite as exhausting. He plans to appear in a Los Angeles production of Samuel Beckett\u2019s absurdist \u201cHappy Days\u201d with his wife.

The video begins on the edge of the city of Aleppo, its western, government-held half. The area we drove through is all government held but has been intensely fought over, again and again, and has changed hands several times. The route we took connects the city to a key supply route \u2014 whoever controls the road determines if the eastern, rebel-held part of the city is besieged or not. The destroyed buildings are in an area that was long held by rebels. The worst of the damage looks like the result of airstrikes. Only the government and, for the past year, its ally Russia have warplanes in the fight here. But some of the destruction could also be from artillery, which both sides have. You go from this moonscape of war-destroyed buildings to a street of buses, open shops and apartments with laundry hanging from the balconies. These are areas that the government never lost, so they were never hit with the heaviest firepower. But rebel groups fire mortars; an individual strike doesn\u2019t cause a building to fall, but that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t kill someone. As you enter western Aleppo, everything seems so normal. It looks like any city. Children are coming home from school. People are coming home from work. There are cars and taxis."]

And although almost any area does occasionally get hit by a shell, after four years of this, people just continue about their daily lives. I took these videos and photographs last week while on a bus tour of western Aleppo that was part of a government public relations offensive. There were 12 journalists, three Ministry of Information minders (government workers assigned to keep tabs on us and those we talked to) and maybe a dozen soldiers. This particular trip was even more controlled by the government than reporters here usually are. We were herded through quick, planned stops. That allowed for almost no random chats with ordinary people. I took this video while we drove past Aleppo University. One of the things so striking about life in war-torn cities is that you see the rhythms of normal life. I saw children still going to school in their little uniforms and hairdos, still running and laughing. Schools have been bombed in the conflict, and children have been killed, 14 of them by government airstrikes recently in rebel-held Idlib Province and three more by rebel shelling a few days later in Aleppo. No one knows how long the war is going to last, and families have decided it\u2019s worth the risk to send their children to school."]

At this point I have a collection of photos of road signs to places that you can no longer get to, like this one above. I can\u2019t go to Azaz from government-held Aleppo because it\u2019s rebel territory. It would be almost impossible, and prohibitively dangerous, to get there, crossing several front lines. One thing that was new to me were these little kiosks lining all of the sidewalks, selling cigarettes or snacks. Some were painted with a Syrian flag or had a United Nations tarp over them, like this one below. To receive a permit to set up a kiosk, you need to have someone in your family who was killed while fighting for the army, or you have to have been displaced from the old city souks, or markets. These kiosks show how the war is changing the cityscape even on the government side of Aleppo. Though the level of destruction here is not comparable to the rebel side, you can still see the ways that the entire city is being changed economically, socially, physically.

In western Aleppo, the shelling mostly comes from the besieged eastern parts of the city. They gave me a room high up, but at least it was facing west. The next morning another journalist rooming on the east side looked up and said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d The hotel had taken so many hits, so many windows were boarded up. In my hotel room, I found a beautiful set of handmade, classic Syrian furniture, a style called mosaic, wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The headboard was carved. There was even a little plate of sweets on the coffee table. I walked into the room and drew the curtains, and I saw beautiful Aleppo, and in the distance this huge plume of smoke. It was the battlefront where rebels outside the city were trying to break the siege of eastern Aleppo. It was a strange combination of elegance and war. This was a relatively quiet night \u2014 there has been a rare break in airstrikes with a unilateral cease-fire announced by Russia. But everyone says that is coming to an end now.

["theater", "STAGE: A NEW SONDHEIM, 'MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG' - The New York Times AS we all should probably have learned by now, to be a Stephen Sondheim fan is to have one's heart broken at regular intervals.  Usually the heartbreak comes from Mr. Sondheim's songs -for his music can tear through us with an emotional force as moving as Gershwin's.  And sometimes the pain is compounded by another factor - for some of Mr. Sondheim's most powerful work turns up in shows (''Anyone Can Whistle,'' ''Pacific Overtures'') that fail. Suffice it to say that both kinds of pain are abundant in ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' the new Sondheim-Harold Prince-George Furth musical that opened at the Alvin last night. Mr. Sondheim has given this evening a half-dozen songs that are crushing and beautiful - that soar and linger and hurt. But the show that contains them is a shambles. ''Merrily We Roll Along'' has been adapted by Mr. Furth from the second George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart collaboration, a Broadway curiosity of 1934. While the new version is rewritten and updated, it repeats the defects of the original text - even as it adds more of its own. Now, as before, ''Merrily'' is about three best friends who reach the top of the Broadway-Hollywood showbiz whirl only to discover, in two cases, that their lives are empty, petty and loveless. The gimmick is to tell the story backwards. The central plot begins with the principals at a present-day party, where they're at their lowest, most jaded ebb. We end up at a high-school graduation, where the hero vows to uphold all the pure ideals we've spent the evening watching him betray."]
["theater", "Mr. Furth blunts the shock effect of the original play's structure by enclosing it within a conventional flashback, and, even so, he fails to solve its major dramatic failure. We never do learn why the characters reached the sad state they're in at the outset. While a busy story - often built around unconvincing, melodramatic twists - does tell us how the three friends fell apart, that's not enough. We keep waiting for some insight into these people - that might make us understand, if not care, about them - but all we get is fatuous attitudinizing about how ambition, success and money always lead to rack and ruin. Like Kaufman and Hart - but unlike Harold Pinter in the similarly designed ''Betrayal'' - Mr. Furth abandons his emotional issues entirely once he moves far back in time. Act II is all anticlimactic plot exposition - an undramatized, breathless recap of the red letter events that first brought the friends to fame. There's another difficulty as well, for the book's tone often seems as empty as its characters. Mr. Furth's one-line zingers about showbiz, laced with unearned nastiness, are as facile as those he brought to ''The Act'' and ''The Supporting Cast.'' He defines the show's principal female character, an alcoholic writer (Ann Morrison), by giving her labored retreads of the wisecracks he wrote for Elaine Stritch in his book for the Sondheim-Prince ''Company.'' Meanwhile, the emotional basis of the friendship between the two heroes, a composer (Jim Walton) and a lyricist (Lonny Price) - or between them and the heroine - is never established at all. We're just told, repeatedly, that they're lifelong friends."]
