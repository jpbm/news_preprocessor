world,Montreal Hacker, 16, Pleads Guilty to 56 Counts of Vandalism - The New York Times A 16-year-old computer hacker who goes by the name Mafiaboy pleaded guilty here today to 56 charges related to attacks last year on some of the busiest commercial Web sites in the United States. From his bedroom overlooking a suburban golf course here, the hacker, a high school freshman, broke into computer networks across the globe, from Yale University to Denmark to South Korea, and implanted software programs that bombarded American Web sites in February, freezing or slowing 11, including amazon.com, cnn.com., ebay.com and yahoo.com. In e-mail exchanges with hacking friends, the youngster boasted that he had covered his tracks by throwing the hard drive of one of his three computers into a nearby river, Cpl. Marc Gosselin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police testified today in Youth Court. Press laws bar publishing the youth's identity because of his age. In court, he wore a suit, a tie and a neatly trimmed goatee and said little. In contrast to the subdued appearance, the young man had recently spent three weeks in jail for bail violations, including verbally abusing teachers. Last month, after having failed all his courses except physical education, he quit school and now works as a busboy in a steakhouse here.
world,''He was fairly proud of what he did, how he committed the crimes and what tools he used,'' Corporal Gosselin said, referring to six weeks of wiretaps and data interceptions that the Mounties conducted at the boy's house in the spring. ''He bragged that the F.B.I. was unable to catch him, that the F.B.I. were fools, and that he would commit these crimes again. He boasted that he would make lots of money with the case and that he would become famous.'' In the most damaging boast, the corporal testified, Mafiaboy told friends that he had vandalized the dell.com Web site, an attack that the Dell Computer Corporation had not disclosed. The teenager has not publicly apologized or cooperated with the investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that in a one-week period in February he caused $1.7 billion in damage by slowing or paralyzing access to the Web sites for up to six hours. In court, Corporal Gosselin said the damage was great, but added, ''I would be very surprised if it would be that high.'' In the six weeks of electronic surveillance, he said, the hacker used four Internet service providers to break into networks, largely ones maintained by United States and Canadian universities. Just before his arrest on April 15, he was boasting in an intercepted on-line chat that he was preparing new assaults on Web sites, according to Corporal Gosselin, the lead investigator.
world,''It is difficult to evaluate damages,'' said Mark Rasch, vice president for cyber law at Predictive Systems Inc., a computer security company in New York. ''While there were tremendous disruptions of networks and a lot of time spent by individuals to fix the problems and a loss of confidence by users in the Internet, there was not anything that was permanently destroyed. To CNN, the loss was loss of advertising revenue. People could not see ads for a couple of hours.'' Judge Gilles Ouellet scheduled a sentencing hearing for April 17 and 18. As a minor, the maximum penalty that the youth faces is two years in prison and a $650 fine.
movies,SUMMER FILMS/PLAYTIME; Don't Bet Your Cybersavings on Video-Game Spinoffs - The New York Times IN 1938, Johan Huizinga, the Dutch medieval historian, published a speculative essay called ''Homo Ludens'' -- literally, ''game playing man.'' In it, Huizinga examined the generally unquestioned labeling of our species as ''Homo sapiens'' -- ''intelligent man.'' Several alternative labels have been put forth by anthropologists and historians: ''man the tool maker,'' ''man the builder'' and so on. But none of those he had read before quite captured our essential quality, Huizinga maintained. What really distinguishes man from other species, he concluded, is that we spend so much time playing games. And so he characterized our species as ''Homo ludens'' -- man the game player. We do seem to enjoy it. How much time does it take to earn our daily bread? And what do we do with the rest of the time? I recall talking to an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago many years ago, and he estimated that early man spent no more than three or four hours a day satisfying his basic requirements. Judging by the people I've worked with, it's about the same today. Even lions hunt but a few hours, and not every day. What is to be done with the rest of the time? Lions sleep and scratch; we play games. These days we play a lot of video games.
movies,The video game industry has been on the threshold of seizing dominance in entertainment for several years. Ultimately it will. It's inevitable: we play games. For the last couple of years, sales of movie tickets and video games have been in a virtual dead heat (no pun intended). Only books are holding their own, and that's because most books are nonfiction and not published for entertainment. Looked at from the entertainment aspect: about two decades ago, at the height of the craze, revenues from the Pac-Man game roughly equaled book sales from all United States publishers. The handwriting was on the wall, but it was in the form of zeroes and ones, and some people couldn't read it. In the 20 years I have been writing about computers and software, I have read numerous articles and editorials predicting the imminent demise of video games. At one point in the early days of personal computing, when games accounted for an overwhelming majority of all software sales, the denunciation rose to a roar. There were critical editorials and articles in all the best places. A fad, they concluded. Continuing strength in game sales has proved to be an irksome reality, and subsequent critical commentary has declined.
movies,Hollywood is moving to the position of ''if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.'' This strategy will fail, and movies will move on into obscurity, a future entertainment category subsidized by taxes and private charity and viewed by a select audience, much like opera and ballet today. They, too, once dominated the entertainment world. There is a fundamental difference between movies and video games: the games are interactive, movies are passive. I don't see any way out of this. There have been several efforts to produce interactive movies, and they have failed miserably. No joystick, no joy. A movie is not a game. Still, they keep trying; don't go quietly into that good night and all that. Or as Satchel Paige put it: ''Don't look back, something might be gaining on you.'' GAMES PEOPLE WATCH In an effort to change the reality that a movie is not a game, on June 15 the hit computer game Tomb Raider will appear as a movie, also called ''Tomb Raider.'' This will be followed on July 11 by the game-based ''Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,'' which in turn will be followed by ''Resident Evil,'' with more to come. Best of luck to everyone concerned. So far, only one of the previous six movies based on computer games has ever made a profit. That was ''Mortal Kombat,'' in 1995, which rode the kung fu craze to $70 million in box office receipts and $37 million in video rentals. The production cost was about $20 million, leaving a very respectable profit, even by Hollywood accounting practices.
movies,What is it that prompts movie companies to make films with a track record of one success in six tries? We could say it's stupidity, but it's really the hope of selling tickets. In fact, the numbers must have started dancing through some heads from the first moment: Let's see . . . there were 17 million copies of ''Tomb Raider'' sold. All the buyers were young guys. If everybody who bought a copy goes to the movie, that'll be 17 million tickets. If they take a date, that'll be 34 million tickets. If they invite a buddy . . . And so on into the daydream world. Before you know it, you've calculated the biggest box office hit of all time and you haven't even finished lunch. What an easy business. Some movies are made from original scripts, but most are made from other movies, old and new, and then from books and plays. Movies have been made from as little as song titles or paintings, and some of them were even successful. And of course movies have been made from comic books. So why not video games? GAMES PEOPLE PLAY Games come with big numbers. Eidos, the British company that produced Tomb Raider, boasts that Tomb Raider is the most successful computer game in history. Though I asked a couple of company representatives, no numbers were forthcoming. The 17 million number for Tomb Raider came from Square-Soft, the maker of Final Fantasy, which says Eidos is living in a, well, fantasy. The most successful computer game in history, Square-Soft says, is its own Final Fantasy, which has sold 30 million copies.
movies,Just how big a video game can be can be seen with a look at the scorecard. At an average price of $35 a game, the sales for the nine adventures of Final Fantasy come to more than $1 billion. Version 10 is about to come out and will add more sales. Tomb Raider, even if the lower number is true, works out to well over a half-billion. A billion dollars is the kind of number that gets attention. At least it gets attention in the front office where the bankers meet. Though a movie ticket admittedly costs less than a video game, no movie has ever come close to a billion dollars in box office sales, and only ''Titanic'' has topped a half-billion dollars. Of course, if you look at movie series -- and after all, the games are a series -- the four episodes of ''Star Wars'' have taken in $1.5 billion. The production cost on ''Tomb Raider'' is said to be about $80 million. In addition, it stars Angelina Jolie, the hot item of the moment. If puffed lips, high breasts and lots of attitude can sell tickets to men -- and there's no reason to believe they can't -- she will make it or break it. In fact, she does look a bit like the exaggerated cartoon figure of Lara Croft, which made Tomb Raider, the game, a big hit among guys. I've heard that sex sells and -- who knows? -- it might be true.
movies,THE FUTURE ISN'T IN THE STARS The presence of stars has not made previous video game movies into hits. ''Super Mario Brothers,'' using characters originally created for the Donkey Kong arcade game, starred Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper but bombed. The film, which cost $50 million, barely managed $21 million at the box office. ''Mortal Kombat'' starred Christopher Lambert of ''Immortal'' fame, but it was the chop-sockey action that was the attraction, not Lambert. ''Street Fighter,'' hot off the video game shelves and into theaters in 1994, starred Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia but had miserable receipts. Of course, none of those guys had Angelina Jolie's talents. As for ''Final Fantasy,'' Sony Pictures and Square Productions say the budget is more than $100 million. I think that's a fantasy, given that there are no locations, no sets and no acting costs other than voice- overs, but I'm not privy to the books. ''Final Fantasy'' is animation, which puts it under the gun. No animated film, except those aimed at young children, has ever scored big money. This one will put that record to the test. The animation is so realistic that for the first moment you don't realize it's animation. A kind of quirky motion, however, soon clues you in, and hints of its heritage in Japanese cartoons.
movies,Certainly the film has the most realistic animation to date. And famous actors -- Donald Sutherland, James Woods and Alec Baldwin -- are the lead voices. I can't help thinking how much better the movie would have been if they had also done the acting. There is a widespread belief that we are nearing a stage in the development of computer-generated figures and motion where live actors will become superfluous. ''Final Fantasy'' is close to that level now, and viewing the 17-minute preview convinces me that live actors have nothing to worry about. They can not only do it better; if it really cost more than $100 million to put this film together, they can do it cheaper. THE NAME OF THE GAME Ultimately, the success or failure of films based on video games has had little or nothing to do with actors or production costs and everything to do with timing and story. In that view, ''Tomb Raider'' could be a winner. It's Indiana Jones with breasts. ''Final Fantasy'' looks less certain, unless it finds a cult audience. The story is based on the kind of nebulous New Age science in which the world is controlled by spirits and supernatural forces. It's best appreciated by those who have had a frontal lobotomy. The story has no relation to the ''Final Fantasy'' video game, by the way.
movies,In fact, this story split has been common to almost all video games that were turned into movies. The movie that hewed closest to the original story and action of the game was ''Mortal Kombat,'' and perhaps it is no accident that it is the most successful to date. Video games don't have much of a story, of course, but then again they don't need it: you play them. Homo Ludens.
world,Execution in China, Through a Brother's Eyes - The New York Times When Qiu Xuanming's body arrived at the crematory from the execution ground last June, his brother recognized it by the clothes. Mr. Qiu's head, which had been shot in the back at close range, was a tightly wrapped ball of white gauze, but the clothes were the same he had worn at his final court hearing a little more than an hour before. ''The pants were undone, and the striped shirt was open and the shirt he was wearing inside was pushed up,'' his brother said in a long cathartic interview at a nearly empty Irish pub in one of Shanghai's new office towers, chosen for the privacy it affords. ''There was blood on his shirt and when I saw the blood I realized what had happened and pulled it open. His belly was cut open, the intestines were spilling out. ''He had gained a lot of weight in prison, he had a 50-inch waist at the end, and the fat was this thick,'' the brother said, holding his thumb and forefinger several inches apart. ''I had never seen anything like that.'' ''I didn't know that's what it looked like,'' he added, his eyes wide with the horror of recollection. ''It was a footlong gash. I had blood on my hands. I saw it and started shouting, 'You've messed with him!' ''
world,Mr. Qiu, executed for tax evasion, had become one of hundreds, or even thousands, of condemned people in China whose organs have been ''harvested'' minutes after their death by gunshot to the back of the head. China executes more people each year than the rest of the world combined, although the exact number is a tightly guarded state secret. Amnesty International counted 18,194 executions reported in the state-run press in the 1990's, with 1,263 in 1999. Robin Munro, a London-based China scholar and human rights advocate, said the real total is much higher because many executions are never reported. Official law journals have sometimes reported figures approaching 1,000 executions a year in individual cities, he added. Many of the executed become organ donors. The practice is permitted under 1994 rules, but only with the written consent of the prisoner or his or her relatives. Because of the need to remove organs immediately after death, bodies may be dissected at the execution site. The practice of using prisoner's organs is widely acknowledged by doctors in China, though few will discuss the subject on the record. Whether most condemned prisoners donate their organs willingly is a matter of debate; Buddhist and Confucian beliefs dictate that the body be kept whole after death, meaning that voluntary donations are rare.
world,It is not clear if Mr. Qiu (pronounced Chyo) was a willing donor. But his tale is particularly chilling given the offense for which he died. Press reports at the time put the amount of tax evaded by him and two accomplices at about $2 million, $1.2 million of which was never recovered. Mr. Qiu's brother says that Mr. Qiu's share of the tax evaded was about half the total and that all of it should have been recovered by liquidating his assets. His brother also contends that Mr. Qiu was an unwitting victim of a larger scheme in which local government officials promised businessmen tax breaks they had no authority to give. China checked the practice, widespread in the mid-1990's, with a wave of executions. China is again in the throes of a  campaign against tax evasion that has already led to death sentences for seven people in Guangdong Province. Many more are expected to receive the ultimate penalty as the campaign sweeps the country. So Mr. Qiu's story provides a glimpse of what might lie in store for those people, and their relatives. ''The last time we spoke was during the Spring Festival of 1996 when he came home,'' recalled Mr. Qiu's brother, a middle-aged businessman with carefully combed hair and well-shined shoes. He said he was telling the story out of frustration with the unresponsiveness of China's justice system and the crushing isolation that relatives of China's condemned face after their loved ones die.
world,Spring Festival, also known as the Lunar New Year, fell in mid-February that year, and is China's biggest holiday. Mr. Qiu brought home his wife and newborn son. The family had no inkling that Mr. Qiu was already in trouble. He was arrested three months later ''and no one in the family was able to speak to him after that,'' his brother said. The family's communication with Mr. Qiu was limited to messages passed through his lawyer or written on postcards censored by the court.  The family could see him only when he was taken from jail to the courthouse to meet his lawyer. Even then, they could only see him through a crack in a door as he passed by. ''Only twice in four years could I see him well, for half an hour at his second trial and then for 10 minutes at his final hearing before he was executed,'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. The brother set about trying to win Mr. Qiu's freedom and said he ultimately spent about $50,000 on lawyer fees, travel expenses and entertainment for court and police officials. ''Most of the money was spent to buy connections to try to change the verdict,'' he said, a sad, embarrassed smile playing over his lips. In some cases, he paid middlemen for introductions to court officials. And he sent Mr. Qiu about $70 a month in prison to ease his life there and to help him develop a network of informants that they hoped would help mitigate his case.
world,Leniency is regularly offered prisoners in China who can provide the state with information that leads to the conviction of other criminals. Mr. Qiu developed a thick dossier on a series of cases, which he turned over to the court. Mr. Qiu's brother even paid for a lawyer and two police officers to fly to Yunnan Province to investigate one case. The investigation proved inconclusive. The local court sentenced Mr. Qiu to death in 1997 and though the provincial court requested a second trial in 1999 it, too, resulted in a death sentence. The provincial court upheld the sentence in August of that year and referred the case to the Supreme People's Court, which must approve death sentences in economic or political cases. ''They said that because the case involved such a large amount of money, someone had to die,'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. He does not know what conditions were like for his brother on death row. ''The last communication we had from him was at the end of May,'' he said. ''He said he felt that he was going to be executed soon.'' In May, the Supreme People's Court notified the provincial court, which notified the county court, that the sentence had been approved. The court informed Mr. Qiu that his execution would be the next day.
world,Normally, families learn of executions only when the crematory asks them to collect the deceased person's ashes. But people in the court who had benefited from the largess of Mr. Qiu's brother told the family that there had been a development. The brother went to the court and saw a notice that Mr. Qiu and one of his accomplices would be executed the next day. The family gathered in court about 8 a.m. for the final hearing. The two men's sentences were read. ''We could see him but couldn't talk to him,'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. ''He looked at me. We were only able to communicate by sight.'' ''I can see in his eyes hate and sadness, that he felt wronged,'' the brother recalled, speaking more slowly and lapsing occasionally into the present tense. ''I could see that he wanted to cry in court, but he is very strong. He raised his head and I could see his eyes close to keep the tears from falling.'' Everyone in the family was crying. After the judge read the verdict and Mr. Qiu was being led out, ''he turned his head and shouted at us: 'I'm going! Take good care of the boy! Take care!' '' Mr. Qiu's brother said he had paid extra to court officials so that the cord binding Mr. Qiu's hands would be loosened. ''I also asked that the people who carried out the execution cause him as little pain as possible,'' he added, his voice catching and eyes reddening.
world,After the hearing, Mr. Qiu's brother and his cousin hailed a taxi, hoping to follow Mr. Qiu to the execution ground. They saw Mr. Qiu and the other condemned man leave the court, each one standing between guards in the back of a five-ton truck. Mr. Qiu was in the second truck, wearing a transparent blue poncho against heavy rain. The trucks, led by a police car and followed by several more, wound through the city's main thoroughfares. ''As they pulled out from the court, he saw me and nodded,'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. ''I could see the rage in his face and I nodded back to him.'' The rain turned to a downpour, visibility dropped to a few feet and Mr. Qiu's brother lost the trucks when the convoy split up at an intersection. ''We took the wrong turn,'' he said, looking down at the restaurant table, where a dish of thick seafood chowder offered to him was growing cold. Mr. Qiu's brother said he later learned that the ropes binding Mr. Qiu's arms were loosened and that when the truck stopped at the execution ground there was no delay. ''He didn't walk very far, several steps, knelt and was shot quickly.'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. The taxi driver said he knew of two execution grounds and they visited both, chasing around the outskirts of the city for an hour. Neither place proved to be right so they drove to the county crematory, where they were told that the other condemned man had already been cremated. Mr. Qiu's body had not yet arrived.
world,''Shortly after we asked, a van arrived,'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. He noticed that the license plates were covered with white paper. Two men got out and pulled out a stretcher. ''I recognized the shoes first,'' he said. He had bought Mr. Qiu black cloth shoes while he was in jail. He recognized the tan pants, the first clothing he had sent Mr. Qiu in prison. He recognized the green-striped shirt and the expensive brown polo shirt underneath it, his final gift to his brother just days before he died. ''The shirt cost 700 yuan,'' about $85, Mr. Qiu's brother remembered. Then he saw what had been done to the body and started shouting. ''They rushed the body into the crematory and one of the crematory staff blocked us from going in,'' he said, growing agitated. ''When the men from the van came back, I shouted again at them, 'You did something to the body.' '' He ran to the van, pulled the paper from the license plate and wrote down the number. A Chinese character on the plate indicated that the van was a military vehicle. ''When I saw that it was a military license plate, I knew that it must have been a military hospital,'' Mr. Qiu's brother said. He and his cousin drove back to the court and demanded an explanation. No family member had been asked if his brother's organs could be removed and he did not believe that his brother would have given consent.
world,The court official said only that the organ removal was done according to regulations. Another court official later told the brother that Mr. Qiu had consented to donate his organs. ''We asked for evidence, but they wouldn't give us any,'' he said. ''They said the consent was given verbally.'' Mr. Qiu's brother said he heard from other people in the court that Mr. Qiu had asked why he needed a blood test when one was administered on the morning of the execution. He was also told that Mr. Qiu was given an injection to prevent his blood from clotting after death. Mr. Qiu's brother said he was initially asked to pay the expense of transporting the body from the execution ground to the crematory, but that the request was dropped after he objected to the removal of his brother's organs. The family was never asked to pay for the bullet used to kill Mr. Qiu, as is often the case with executions in China. But telling this story carries grave risks. After complaining to central government authorities in Beijing, Mr. Qiu's brother was warned to keep silent or face retribution. He said he now lives in fear.
technology,Virtual Mayhem Arouses Real Anger at Hackers' Attack - The New York Times THE killing started on New Year's Day. The victims were virtual: characters created by participants in the online version of a popular role-playing game, Diablo II, in which gamers embark on quests and accumulate arcane possessions while encountering -- and often smiting -- others. These weren't just any characters: the dead and dying were among the most successful on the ranking maintained by Blizzard Entertainment, the company that created the game. Several of the top characters ''have mysteriously died today,'' wrote a worried Diablo fan on a Web site where games are discussed, Network54, moments after the new year began. ''Only 3 of the top 10 remain alive.'' Within an hour, all of the top 10 were gone. Characters die all the time in role-playing games: an encounter with an ax-wielding goatman or a marauding sand maggot can shorten anyone's life span considerably. But the Diablo murders were the handiwork of a real-life adversary: hackers. Exploiting a bug in the software that underlies Diablo II and other Blizzard games on the company's free Battle.net Web site, the malicious computer intruders were able to take on the identities of top players, steal their armor, weapons and other hard-won possessions and kill them. Ultimately, hundreds of players were affected. ''It's like watching some sort of disaster unfolding,'' wrote a Network54 participant. ''I can't help but feel like I'm witnessing the virtual equivalent of the Titanic or the Hindenburg,'' wrote another. Others called it ''the Internet's first mass murder.''
technology,All online games, to a certain extent, have suffered from cheaters and hackers, said Matt Pritchard, a game designer who helped create the game Age of Empires, which is published by Microsoft. ''As long as there have been online games, people have cheated,'' said Mr. Pritchard, who attributed the phenomenon to ''something about human nature.'' Hacker attacks, he added, can leave a lasting wound -- for the companies. Players who have a disappointing experience quickly move to another game, another site. ''It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that sooner or later this all circles back to our bottom line,'' Mr. Pritchard said. Blizzard, which has angered players in the past with a perceived lax attitude toward cheating and hacking, earned praise from its players by quickly coming up with a solution: bringing the dead back to life. On Monday it announced that it had corrected the flaw in its software and said that on Jan. 8 it would restore all characters killed between Dec. 19 and Jan. 1. (The company has not been in touch with law enforcement officials about the act of computer mischief, said Paul Sams, Blizzard's senior vice president for business development.) ''This has basically turned around the opinion of Blizzard in a lot of people's minds,'' said Nicholas Ryan, a California-based software engineer and Diablo fan.
technology,Still, the sense of violation is strong in the fragile online community of Diablo players. ''The e-mails I'm getting, some of them are very sad,'' said Gaile Gray, who writes for a nonprofit Web site for Diablo devotees called DiabloII.net. All of the hours, weeks and months spent building a character and accumulating possessions through role playing means that ''you do invest a bit of yourself and a bit of your pride in your character,'' she said. ''I don't think anyone's going to throw themselves off of a bridge over the loss of a Diablo II character,'' Ms. Gray said. But, she added, ''when someone maliciously destroys them, there's a feeling of loss.'' The anguish the players felt, she said, is the same as ''if you got a book and you were really enjoying reading it, and you got right to the end and somebody had carved out the last chapter.'' ''It's the same kind of vandalistic mentality,'' she said. An overseas fan posted a plaintive call for help on the Blizzard online bulletin board, nearly unintelligible but as powerful as blank verse: now . . . my item all lost . . . sword.two ring.amulet.amor.boots.helm . . . what happen . . . ?? my charecter is lv90 baba . . . mana-source and name is serverdownT-T i need really help . . . hu . . . i waiting your message . . . i like blizzrd and dia2 . . . plz . . . help me . . .
technology,Not everyone was sympathetic to the plight of the victims. On the site Slashdot, which calls itself ''News for Nerds,'' the news of the Diablo raid was treated with derision by some readers. ''Now these top players can leave their basements and return to reality a bit more often,'' sneered Daniel Lutker, at the State University of New York at Albany. ''Maybe they could even go outside.''
sports/golf,Back to a Short Putter, Adam Scott Is Happy With the Results - The New York Times DORAL, Fla. —  Adam Scott looked as if he were paying tribute to the recently departed Leonard Nimoy on Thursday on the greens of Doral’s Blue Monster. Holding his putter in his left hand, Scott rested his right hand, palm down, lightly on the grip and gave his golf ball a modified Vulcan salute. He was greeting a new old friend. For the first time in four years and 83 worldwide starts, Scott used a short putter in his round of two-under-par 70 at the World Golf Championships event. Making his 2015 debut, Scott had 27 putts, two more than J. B. Holmes, who set the pace with a tournament record-tying 62. “Tough golf course except for a couple of guys who shot really low,” Scott said, referring to Holmes and Ryan Moore, who carded a six-under 66 with a double bogey on the last hole. Scott, who missed only one putt inside 15 feet, described himself as “very happy” with his performance on the greens. “I’m trying not to clutter my head with too much thought,” he said. The last time Scott used a conventional putter in competition was at the Sony Open in Hawaii in January 2011. He posted rounds of 72 and 70 to miss the cut. At the time, he was so discouraged by his performance on the greens, he said, “You could have given me a hockey stick and I would have used that.”
sports/golf,After consulting with his brother-in-law, Brad Malone, who is also his swing coach, Scott unveiled his broomstick model a month later at the World Golf Championship match play event outside Tucson. With it, he won the 2013 Masters and ascended to No. 1 last year. The long putter will be banned starting next year, and Scott decided there was no time like the present to make the switch. “I thought because I do have to make an adjustment by the end of this year, if I’m going to spend some time doing it, I should try and start now and maybe find the best solution,” Scott said. After experimenting with a couple of models in his practice sessions, Scott settled on one and forged ahead, treating it as if he were taking a test using a No. 2 pencil. He felt prepared, so he did not expect any discernible difference. “My stroke and everything feels as good as it ever has,” Scott said, adding: “It really isn’t that big a deal. It just takes a little while to adjust and change a couple of muscle-memory things.” Scott’s feel on the longer putts was tested early in his round. On the first seven holes, his closest approach was 14 feet. Scott had a 33-footer for birdie on the first that he came within 14 inches of holing. He drained a 14-foot putt on the eighth for the first of four birdies in a five-hole stretch. His stay at four-under was brief. He played the next two holes in three-over. “I played a really good round of golf other than that,” he said.
sports/golf,Scott did not throw out the process with the long putter. He kept the modified claw grip he used with the broomstick. He also continues to use the AimPoint Express method of reading greens, in which he reads the slope with his feet and raises fingers on his right hand to correspond with the amount of break. He did not even discard his long putter. Scott brought it with him from his native Australia to use as a training tool. He felt no need, he said, to snap the old putter over his knee so he would not be tempted to go back to it. “It treated me pretty well,” Scott said, “so I don’t think it deserves a snapping.” The switch has invigorated Scott’s putting, which was very good, in stretches, earlier in his career. “It felt a bit like when I switched to the longer putter,” Scott said. “It was a really different, fresh feel, and so is this. I’m not doing things exactly the same as I did them before. It’s been feeling really good.” A change in putters was the least of the adjustments Scott has made since his last trip to the States. After the Tour Championship he replaced his longtime caddie, Steve Williams, with Mike Kerr. On Feb. 15, he became a first-time father when his wife, Marie, gave birth to a daughter, Bo Vera. After nine days of diaper duty, Scott, 34, left Australia and settled in for a six-week stay in the United States that will take him through the Masters.

well,How Do People Die From Diabetes? - The New York Times Q. How do people die from diabetes? A. People who have diabetes cannot regulate their blood sugar levels and if the disease isn’t tightly controlled, blood sugar can spike to abnormally high levels, a condition called hyperglycemia, or dip below normal, a condition called hypoglycemia. Both conditions are potentially life-threatening and can lead to coma and death if not promptly treated. But complications resulting from the disease are a more common cause of death. Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes. People with Type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease, are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity, Dr. Gabbay said, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The good news,” he said, “is that a lot of treatments, like those for lowering cholesterol, are even more effective at lowering risk in people with diabetes than in people without.” Some new classes of diabetes medications used for Type 2 diabetes have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, he said. People with Type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk for heart disease, though the reasons are less clear.
well,Both types of diabetes can also lead to other long-term complications, like kidney disease, that may result in premature death. Problems like vision loss, nerve damage and infections that may lead to amputations can increase the likelihood of injuries and accidents. Good disease management starting early in the disease process helps people avoid some of these complications, Dr. Gabbay said. Do you have a health question? Ask Well

opinion,Pakistan’s Tyrannical Majority - The New York Times JUST after the stroke of midnight on Aug. 14, 1947, the Peshawar broadcast station of All India Radio crackled to life: “This is Pakistan Broadcasting Service.” Next came the words of the Urdu-language poet Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi: “Pakistan bananay walay, Pakistan Mubarak” — “Oh, maker of Pakistan, congratulations on Pakistan.” On Saturday, Pakistanis will head to the polls to choose a new government; for the first time in 66 years, a democratically elected administration has completed its term. Given Pakistan’s tumultuous past, this is an impressive achievement, but it should not prevent citizens from asking the candidates vying for their votes: what kind of Pakistan have you made? The makers of Pakistan were peasants and laborers. In 1940, they passed a resolution in Lahore to demand a separate homeland for Muslims and an end to British colonial occupation. In 1946, their votes brought a political party, the Muslim League, to power. They chose Muhammad Ali Jinnah, a modernist technocrat, as their leader. Jinnah asked his party’s legislators to focus on the well-being of the “masses and the poor” and demanded that “every one of you, no matter to what community he belongs, no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what is his color, caste or creed, is first, second and last a citizen of this State with equal rights, privileges and obligations.” Men like Muhammad Zafrulla Khan (an Ahmadi diplomat) and Raja Amir Ahmad Khan (a Shiite noble) had worked alongside Jinnah for decades to fulfill this dream of equality.
opinion,Yet the birth of Pakistan was not auspicious for minorities. The original claim of Pakistan — religious equality — was the first claim proved false. Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, though he became the first foreign minister, was hounded by religious conservatives, who branded him an apostate because of his Ahmadi faith. Ahmadis, followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), consider themselves part of the Muslim tradition but have faced stern resistance from Sunni Muslims, who accused them of following a false prophet. In 1974, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto passed an amendment to the Pakistani Constitution declaring anyone who did not believe that Muhammad was the last prophet a non-Muslim. And in the 1980s, the military dictator Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq passed punitive laws that defined the practice of the Ahmadi faith as a “blasphemous” criminal offense. Ahmadis are allowed to vote only for parliamentary seats reserved for non-Muslims, effectively disenfranchising them. Since they refuse to declare themselves non-Muslims, they don’t vote. Shiites have not fared much better. Raja Amir Ahmad left Pakistan, soon after 1947, fearing for the safety of his community. In the last five years, more than 1,000 Shiites, belonging to the Hazara community, have been targeted and killed in the city of Quetta. In February, when 84 Shiites were killed in a bombing attack, Quetta’s Hazaras refused to bury their murdered kin, demanding that the government ensure their safety. The corpses, wrapped in burial shrouds in coffins, were kept on the streets and mourned by thousands. This act of civic protest shook the nation, but it did little to prompt action from the state.
opinion,Today, tolerance is under siege from all directions. Even Imran Khan, the sports star turned politician — who enjoys a near-divine status among young, urban Pakistanis — has contributed to the marginalization of minorities. On May 4, he said at a rally that he did not regard Ahmadis as Muslims and would not campaign for their votes. Mr. Khan has based his campaign on a message of “change” reminiscent of President Obama’s in 2008. His statement on Ahmadis was therefore particularly damaging and chilling. As a candidate marketing himself as a political outsider, he could have opened up a national conversation on equality of citizenship and reached out to all voters, including Ahmadis, Hindus and Christians. Instead he reaffirmed the political exclusion of minorities and legitimized intolerance in the eyes of his millions of idealistic young followers, who quickly echoed his dismissal in online networks. Over the last five years, hundreds of Ahmadis have been targeted and killed in Pakistan’s cities. In 2010, 94 were killed in a terrorist attack in Lahore, and since then their burial grounds, mosques and homes have been under assault. There has been no response from the government, which still refuses to grant them equal status as citizens of Pakistan. Christian communities have also been targeted, and prominent Christian leaders, like Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister of minorities, have been assassinated. While the state has done little to punish these acts, various militant organizations have brazenly claimed credit for them.
opinion,The candidates campaigning in this election, rather than arguing for the rights of all Pakistanis, have further marginalized religious minorities and given license to those who attack them. Despite the rise of satellite television and online media that have allowed mass participation in politics outside of old patronage networks, a new form of majoritarian tyranny has taken hold. It is built on the classic anxieties of the rising middle class: the fear of the other, the conspirator among us. Today, the verses of another poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, who was imprisoned and exiled by Pakistan’s military dictators, seem more appropriate: “Chalay chalo kay woh manzil abhi nahin aaye” — “Keep on walking, for we are not at the destination yet.”
opinion,No Reason to Wait on Marriage - The New York Times In a wise ruling last month, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson declared that same-sex couples “must be allowed to marry in order to obtain equal protection of the law under the New Jersey Constitution.” On Thursday, she ordered that same-sex marriages be allowed starting Monday because New Jersey would suffer no harm if gay men and lesbians are permitted to wed. Gov. Chris Christie, however, is pursuing an appeal of her decision, and the State Supreme Court has scheduled oral argument on the case in early January. In the interest of equality, the state’s top court should deny Mr. Christie’s request for a temporary stay preventing same-sex marriages from beginning in New Jersey. It is evident that civil unions under New Jersey law do not afford the equal treatment that the State Supreme Court promised in a 2006 decision. The inequality became even more blatant once federal agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services began rolling out rules providing federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. Those benefits are not available to those in civil unions. Given what the court has said in the past, it seems likely that Mr. Christie will ultimately lose his appeal on the merits. There is no reason to continue inflicting injury on New Jersey residents while the appeal is pending. Same-sex couples and their families would suffer serious harm if marriage equality were delayed, including humiliating second-class status and the denial of federal benefits.
world/middleeast,Israel Halts Talks, Citing Palestinian Unity Agreement - The New York Times JERUSALEM — The Israeli government decided on Thursday to suspend American-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians because of the agreement the Palestinians announced on Wednesday between two rival factions, one of which refuses to recognize Israel’s right to exist. After a meeting of top ministers that lasted nearly all day, Israel announced that it would freeze the negotiations until the Palestinians’ reconciliation agreement is reversed or collapses. With the Palestinian factions intending to form a new unity government in the next five weeks, Israel said it would not resume negotiations with any government backed by Hamas, the militant Islamist faction that Israel, like the United States, considers a terrorist organization. “Whoever chooses the terrorism of Hamas does not want peace,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement circulated by his office. The statement promised unspecified retaliatory measures against the Palestinians. The agreement between Hamas, which controls the Gaza strip, and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is dominated by the more moderate Fatah party and governs the West Bank, “was signed even as Israel is making efforts to advance the negotiations with the Palestinians,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “It is the direct continuation of the Palestinians’ refusal to advance the negotiations.”
world/middleeast,The peace talks, begun at American urging last summer, were far from reaching a resolution, and were due to end in five days. Secretary of State John Kerry and his peace envoy, Martin Indyk, have been working furiously to find a formula under which the parties would extend them. Mr. Kerry and President Obama have issued dire warnings that this round of talks may be the last chance for a negotiated two-state solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The peace talks were stalemated for months, and had been on the brink of collapse since April 2, when the Palestinians, frustrated by Israel’s failure to keep a promise to release a group of Palestinian prisoners, moved to join 15 international conventions in defiance of Israel. Both sides and the United States had said they wanted to keep the peace process going, but they remained far apart on the terms for doing so. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace talks, said Israel had “deliberately sabotaged the peace process” by halting the talks and by refusing to freeze construction of settlements in the West Bank, as the Palestinians have demanded. “The Israeli government was given the choice between peace and settlements, but it chose settlements,” Mr. Erekat said in a telephone interview Thursday evening. Many analysts saw Wednesday’s reconciliation deal as a ploy by President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to press Israel into making concessions to keep the talks going. Instead, it seems to have provided Mr. Netanyahu with a pretext for walking away from them.
world/middleeast,Mr. Abbas “basically miscalculated,” said Hillel Frisch, a professor at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University who specializes in Palestinian politics and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “They were both in it to appease the Americans, and wanted to blame each other for the failure of the talks. By moving with Hamas, they played into Israeli hands.” After the reconciliation deal drew harsh reactions from Israel and Washington, Palestinian leaders had sought on Thursday to soften its impact on the peace process. Jibril Rajoub, a top official in Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction, said that the new government would recognize Israel and renounce violence, meeting the conditions set by the “Quartet” of Middle East peacemakers —the United States, United Nations, Russia and the European Union —that Hamas has repeatedly rejected. “The government of national consent that will be established, headed by Abu Mazen, will declare clearly and unequivocally that it accepts the Quartet’s conditions,” Mr. Rajoub said, using Mr. Abbas’s nickname in an interview on Israel’s Army Radio channel. “There is no cause for concern.” Similarly, Yasser Abed Rabbo, secretary of the P.L.O. executive committee, called Wednesday’s agreement “merely a first step” and said that American and Israeli reactions were “premature.” For its part, Hamas signaled that it was drawing a distinction between its own views and those of the unity government it was joining and that there was no need for Hamas to recognize Israel.
world/middleeast,“You don’t need organizations to recognize Israel,” Ghazi Hamad, the Hamas deputy foreign minister, told Ynet, an Israeli news website. “It’s enough that the Palestine Liberation Organization — the representative of the Palestinian people — recognizes the State of Israel.” As for whether his party would renounce violence, Mr.Hamad told Ynet that the question would be worked out in negotiations with Fatah over the next few weeks. Several Palestinian officials and analysts emphasized that the promised new government was to be made up of “technocrats” — professionals who are not partisan political figures — and that its task was to unify the Gaza Strip and West Bank after a seven-year schism and prepare for elections to be held in six months. Therefore, they said, there was no contradiction between a reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, and the Palestinian government’s continued negotiation with Israel. But Mkhaimer Abusaada, a Gaza-based political analyst, said the new government would be subject to a confidence vote by the Palestinian Legislative Council, an elected body that has a Hamas majority. “If Hamas gives a vote of confidence in this government, and this government is going to accept the Quartet preconditions, what is the contradiction between such a deal and negotiations with Israel?” Mr. Abusaada asked. “If that government takes a vote of confidence from the P.L.C. and at the end of the day the government is going to accept the Quartet preconditions, that means that Hamas is indirectly accepting the conditions of the Quartet. Whether that will work or not, we’ll have to see.”
world/middleeast,Whatever nuances Palestinians may find in Hamas’s position, Mr. Netanyahu was emphatic in an interview with MSNBC on Thursday that Israel “will not negotiate with a Palestinian government backed by Hamas.” “These people are calling for the obliteration of the Jewish state,” and were “openly, openly calling for the killing of Jews wherever you find them,” he said. Mr. Netanyahu said Israel was still prepared to talk peace. “If we encounter a Palestinian leadership and Palestinian government that is ready to pursue genuine peace negotiations, we’re going to be there,” he said. But he said that Mr. Abbas had, by embracing Hamas, “made a terrible decision for peace and I think, by the way, a terrible decision for his own people.”
world/europe,Inquiry Urged on Site Called Mass Grave of Irish Babies - The New York Times
garden,Failing Home Economics - The New York Times IT was nearly six months ago that Jill Andresky Fraser, a financial journalist, was undone by a cauliflower. Like almost every other household in America, Ms. Fraser’s was starting to embrace a new austerity, and the cauliflower was an early milestone. Until this year, Ms. Fraser, whose math skills are formidable (she has written books on personal and corporate finance), had always practiced a shopping calculus that balanced time against money. “If there was a choice between the two, I would choose anything that would save me time,” Ms. Fraser said. But no longer. And so it was that she found herself shopping for groceries on the Upper West Side, stymied by the price of a cauliflower ($5) in the first store she visited. A market a block or so away sold cauliflowers for $2.99 each, but a can of artichoke hearts (another item on her list) was $4.99. A third store offered a deal — three heads of cauliflower for $5 — which was a good thing, because it was getting late and the day was disintegrating into the narrative of a fourth-grader’s word problem. Ms. Fraser filled a cart with cauliflower and other groceries. When the cashier rung her up, however, it turned out that the artichoke hearts at this store were $6.99 a can, and Ms. Fraser had bought four.
garden,“So on the one hand I had saved all this money on cauliflower,” Ms. Fraser said, “but probably my family was never going to eat that much cauliflower, and there was the problem of the $7 artichokes. In the end, I had spent more money than I had ever planned. This was a cosmic moment.” All around the country, at similar cosmic moments, perfectly sound brains have been seizing up like an old car on a frigid day, particularly in the last few weeks. As Americans attempt to perform cost-benefit analyses of their needs and behaviors, they are whittling pennies from cable bills only to squander dollars on gas driving miles to discount stores, or on coupon-spurred splurges for nonessential items, like Cheez Whiz or organizing supplies. Pinched by shriveled retirement and college accounts, battered by ballooning mortgage costs, rent and co-op maintenance increases, and hedging against the possibility that a job might vanish, some are practicing economies that may not deserve the name. When Best Buy announced  its latest sales figures last month, the company reported “an unprecedented drop in consumer buying of items like flat-screen televisions,” said Ori Brafman, a business expert and an author, with his brother, Rom, of  “Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior,” out since June from Doubleday Business. “But when Wal-Mart released its report last week, there was a surprise. Consumers had increased their flat-screen purchases. Somehow, because Wal-Mart feels like a bargain store, shoppers who have deprived themselves of luxury items elsewhere rationalized their purchases at Wal-Mart as ‘getting a good deal,’ ” Mr. Brafman continued. “Granted, flat-panel TV’s at Wal-Mart might run a little cheaper than elsewhere, but no financial adviser would include one on his or her list of Items to Buy During Tough Times.”
garden,Americans may be forgoing Starbucks and stocking up on Spam, but they are also making severe “diagnostic errors,” Mr. Brafman said. “They’re stressed out, and using the wrong information” — such as the belief that buying at Wal-Mart equals saving money — “to make a decision, and ignoring all other data that contradicts that decision.” Kathy Peel, a Dallas-based family manager (that is, a life coach whose niche is training families to run their homes like businesses), said that instances of feckless budgeting and bad math seem to be on the rise, at least judging from the reports of coaches trained in her system. Leslie McKee, a Peel-trained family manager in Pittsburgh, has noticed a pattern of “people signing up for discount stores that sell in bulk and over-purchasing ‘bargains’ that are so enormous they will not live long enough to use the item,” she said. “Then they call me and spend more money to help them organize it all into mini-malls inside their homes.” At the high end, there are bulk buyers like Rick Angres, a screenwriter in Santa Monica, Calif., who visits two farmers’ markets each week, stocking up on lilies and orchids. “On the one hand I get a very good price,” he said. “On the other hand, I spend perhaps 10 times as much on flowers as is appropriate for a man of my means.”
garden,Representing the opposite extreme, Ms. McKee said, is the client who is rewinding adding-machine tape so she can use the other side, or the woman whose laundry room is cluttered with dozens of empty laundry detergent bottles, awaiting their turn in the washer, where she leaves one each night — cap off and upside down — to drain out the last drop of liquid. “What’s happening I think is we are letting all our gremlins out,” said Carol Prisant, American editor of The World of Interiors magazine. “Some people will obsess about drops of detergent and others will want to buy in massive quantities. This is the moment when we all sort of mildly crack up.” Ms. Prisant, an antiques expert who has written books on how to gauge the value of furniture and other decorative objects, nonetheless stumbled recently, with a budgeting choice that involved shunning the $12 quart of green tomato soup at Grace’s Market — once a weekly purchase — but forking out $500 for two extra-large doughnut-shaped and oyster-colored dog beds from Perfect Dog Beds, which match the color of her new apartment. “O.K., the old ones were yucky,” Ms. Prisant said. “But they were also, um, brown.”
garden,“Grocery wise, cable foolish” is how Richard Winkler, an executive producer at Curious Pictures, a television production company in Manhattan, describes his current habits. “You know, walking three blocks to save 10 cents on Triscuits,” Mr. Winkler said, while “my phone bill still has charges like $4.99 per month for technical stunts I can’t even pronounce, much less access. No wonder Verizon is doing well.” (Mr. Winkler, whose wife has been entering their expenses into a Quicken financial planning program, vows to look at the budget she’s created — soon, really — and start pruning the premium channels from his cable bill.) And then there are those who are attempting to save money by spending it. Last month, Terence Lance Buckley, a Manhattan public relations executive, spent $400 at Overstock.com on an electric fireplace, hoping to keep his thermostat off this winter. Mr. Buckley had just moved, and the rent on his new apartment includes electricity but not gas. He now has a beautiful fake fireplace and mantel, but the thing gives off barely enough heat to warm his hands. “Now I’m cranking up the thermostat to stay warm,” he said, “leading me to believe that my brilliant budget plan to save money on heating costs was a waste of $400, money that I could have put towards holiday gifts.” AS nonsensical as these maneuvers may appear, behavioral economists and financial consultants like Mr. Brafman say there are reasons for them, variables beyond a bank balance that give rise to gyrations in spending and saving. Psychologically, Mr. Brafman said, sometimes we just can’t do the math.
garden,A behavior called loss aversion tends to freeze consumers in place in one area even as spending in other areas remains unchecked. Mr. Brafman noted that many would-be travelers, rattled by the rise at the pump last summer, canceled their vacation plans while continuing to spend at home. Gas prices were up, on average, $2 a gallon, he said. “It seems like a substantial amount, but for a 600 mile trip, that amounts to $80 in savings. This could have been easily recouped by cutting out one trip to a restaurant.” Loss aversion is a naturally selected trait, said his brother, Rom, a psychologist, “left over from when cavemen were trying to keep the deer they had just killed away from the bear.” Dan Ariely, a professor of behavioral economics at M.I.T. and the author of “Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions” (HarperCollins, 2008), suggests that our irrational financial behaviors are irrational in very predictable ways. “In my book I tell the story of the $15 pen,” he said. “What if you were told the same pen cost $8 less at a store seven blocks away? You’d walk to the store, right? But if you’re buying a suit for $1,115, and the salesman says, Guess what, you can get the same suit for $8 less at a store seven blocks away, you’re not likely to take that walk.”
garden,“Need” and “cost,” he pointed out, are deeply personal and wildly relative. “I have a student at M.I.T.,” Mr. Ariely continued, “a very smart guy, who just wrote me bemoaning the fact he’d lost all this money in the stock market.” The student told Mr. Ariely he had wanted to buy a $4,000 mountain bike, and regretted not doing so before the stock slide. However, he had decided to buy the thing anyway. “He had lost so much money already he was immunized against feeling the pinch of the purchase of the mountain bike,” Mr. Ariely said. “In other words, having lost $40,000 in one week, looking at spending $4,000 on a bike seemed like nothing. We see money in relative, rather than absolute, terms.” What is rational behavior, anyway? In economic terms, Mr. Ariely said, “rational would mean that you take all possible information into account and you make the optimal decision. But I have a more relaxed definition, which is that rational decisions are those you make and don’t regret later.” Seen in this way, the pleasure of the $4 coffee you still drink may be rational. That is, “unless I interview you three years from now,” Mr. Ariely added, “and you tell me you regret not saving that money for beer.”
garden,In the meantime, Ms. Prisant is happy with her dog beds, which arrived the other day, and said she has no regrets. “Fortunately my math is terrible,” she said, so she didn’t know if she was  in the red or the black this week. Mr. Buckley is still ruing the purchase of his fireplace. And Ms. McKee, the family manager, is trying to teach her clients restraint. “Store it at the store,” is how she put it. “Buy it when you need it. Portion control studies have shown that when we buy more, we use more.” And Ms. Fraser, the cauliflower buyer, has refashioned her “cosmic moment” as a business opportunity. Her new blog, EconoWhiner.com, is fueled by two principles. One is pure service, “actionable advice from Real World Joes,” as she put it, like price comparisons on all sorts of items (as of this week, canned tomatoes, tuna and olive oil, but no cauliflower), tips for surviving a firing and how to slash funeral costs. The other mandate is catharsis. Goaded by the remark by former Senator Phil Gramm that America is a “nation of whiners,” Ms. Fraser would like to invite readers to her site to vent and complain. “A lot of people tend to blame themselves,” she said. “But we can only go so far blaming ourselves. This situation is beyond our control, we’re saddled with a mess we didn’t create. Complaining is a very effective defense.” If you can’t budget, whine.
world/asia,After ’09 Fraud, Afghanistan Reports a Cleaner Election - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — The Afghan presidential election on Saturday appeared to be substantially cleaner than the widely discredited 2009 election, according to complaint figures released Tuesday by the authorities here. None of the leading candidates have said so far that they would dispute this year’s balloting, whose results have not yet been announced. Widespread complaints about ballot-box stuffing in 2009 led the country’s Independent Election Complaints Commission to order a recount, which cost President Hamid Karzai the outright majority that he initially appeared to have secured, though he still won a second term. “The scale of fraud and violations in this election was much lower compared to previous elections,” said Nader Mohseni, the spokesman for the commission, citing both international and Afghan election observers. In the 48-hour period for filing complaints, which ended Monday night, the commission recorded 1,573 formal complaints, Mr. Mohseni said. “Compared with 7.5 million people who voted, that number is very small,” he said. “That’s what the international observers believe as well.” He said that 228 of the complaints were lodged against one or another of the eight presidential candidates or their campaigns. By contrast, the commission recorded 2,842 complaints after the 2009 election, according to the National Democratic Institute. The institute had international monitors in Afghanistan in 2009 and tried again this year, but withdrew the monitors shortly before the voting after one was killed in an attack by insurgents.
world/asia,Under Afghan election law, the candidates are supposed to refrain from claiming victory until the official results are released, which may not happen until April 24, officials have said. Nonetheless, of the three major candidates, two have let it be known that they believe they won outright by taking more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round. One candidate — Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank official and longtime Karzai aide — went as far as posting a pie chart on his personal Facebook page showing 57 percent of the vote for him, with Abdullah Abdullah, the runner-up in 2009, supposedly receiving 26 percent and Zalmay Rassoul, Mr. Karzai’s former foreign minister, a distant third with 10 percent. The pie chart was apparently based on tabulations of 5.12 million votes compiled by Mr. Ghani’s campaign. “Congratulations to him,” Mr. Abdullah said mockingly of Mr. Ghani’s claims, which were later withdrawn from his Facebook page. “And he’s been very gracious in according me, also, some votes in the country, so I’m grateful.” In an interview on Monday, Mr. Abdullah said that his 20,000 observers had reported results to him, but that he was going to wait until the election commission released its official tallies before speaking about his own. “We have to respect the rule of law here,” he said. But people involved in his campaign released figures they said were based on analysis of 2.25 million votes (about one-third of the total cast), showing Mr. Abdullah with 50 percent; by their reckoning, Mr. Ghani was running second with 38 percent and Mr. Rassoul third with 10 percent.
world/asia,Whatever the credibility of these rival counts, it seemed likely that the contest was coming down to Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah. Mr. Ghani claimed as much in an interview Sunday: “The pattern has become clear, the losers are clear. It has become a two-way race, whatever else one says.” For his part, Mr. Rassoul has been silent about the results. One of his supporters, though, Gen. Helaluddin Helal, a former deputy interior minister who works on Mr. Rassoul’s campaign, said his two opponents’ tallies were suspect, and in some places showed more votes cast than there were residents to cast them. “Those votes are not real votes,” he said. “Rassoul is not giving up.” Still, a former Afghan official who is close to Mr. Rassoul said his campaign had concluded that it would most likely place third behind Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah. Mr. Rassoul was the only one of the three major candidates who made a clear promise to accept whatever results the election commission announces. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah have each praised the election as relatively clean, but both have registered complaints of irregularities and stopped short of committing to accept the official outcome. “The scale of the fraud is not massive,” Mr. Ghani said. Mr. Abdullah said that the 2014 poll was “much cleaner” than 2009 and that he “would accept the results in accordance with the process, yes, whatever, anything — but not ballot papers from the sky.”
world/asia,There were major differences in campaign monitoring this year, compared with 2009. The five-member complaints commission had three foreign members in 2009, but this year it is entirely Afghan. Similarly, there was extensive international influence over the election commission in 2009; this year it is headed by Mohammad Yusuf Nuristani, a former spokesman for Mr. Karzai’s government. International monitoring groups and United Nations officials have praised both bodies for doing a credible job. And in the years since 2009, a small army of Afghans have been trained as poll-watchers and monitors, working for political parties and civic organizations as well as international groups. Mr. Mohseni of the complaints commission said it would take time to investigate the reports of irregularities, and he did not rule out possible action. “The fact that the election was successful does not mean there has not been fraud and violations during the election,” he said.
sports/baseball,With Washington Senators’ Move, a Youth Torn Away - The New York Times In 1989, my 10-year-old son, Brendan, asked if I would take him and his younger brother Patrick to a trading card show. When I was Brendan’s age, in 1955, I boasted the largest card collection in my Washington neighborhood — hundreds filling two large boxes. The cards in those days were not for collecting. They were for bartering, trading and learning the career statistics of favorite players. Roaming the card show with two boys hunting for a Michael Jordan rookie card, I was shocked to discover that a 1955 Mickey Mantle card listed for $2,400. I asked a couple of vendors if they had any old Washington Senators cards. They stared back blankly. We were in Year 18 of the exile of Washington baseball from the nation’s capital. The Senators had left for Texas after the 1971 season, the second team in a little more than a decade to desert Washington. I paused at a table and thumbed through an aged binder. Suddenly, my legs felt weak. Staring up at me through the plastic-sheet protector was the 1952 Topps card of Eddie Yost, hero of my youth, presenter at the Nativity School C.Y.O. awards dinner and longtime Senators third baseman. I turned the card over. On the back was the information we memorized as children: 154 games, .283 batting average, 109 runs.
sports/baseball,I thought I was hallucinating. I had spent every penny I had on those Topps cards, which cost a nickel a pack at the drugstore in our Fort Stevens neighborhood. (Fort Stevens was our local monument, the Civil War site where Lincoln came to see the action during one battle and was almost shot.) By the sixth grade, I had a most impressive collection, but I cared only about the cards of my team. The Washington Senators were charter members of the American League in 1901. They won the pennant in 1924, 1925 and 1933, and the World Series in 1924. They hosted the president 40 times on opening day. Their greatest star was pitcher Walter Johnson, who won 417 games and set a career strikeout record that lasted for 55 years. From the arrival of Johnson through the 1930s, the team was respectable, averaging 76 wins. In the first half of the ’40s, with most of the best players serving in World War II, the Senators cobbled together teams that finished second in 1943 and in 1945. Then came the long descent to baseball oblivion. Unfortunately, I was born in 1945. The team was owned by Clark Griffith, who looked like a grandfather in a Frank Capra movie. Hired to manage the team in 1912, Griffith bought a controlling interest in 1920 and ran it as a mom-and-pop operation until his death in 1955. He depended on rent from the Washington Redskins and colleges and high schools in the area to pay his bills. The Senators had $25,000 in the bank when he died.
sports/baseball,From 1940 to 1950, Griffith Stadium was also a home to the Homestead Grays of the Negro leagues. The Grays featured Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard, two of the greatest players in baseball history. If the Senators had signed them, who knows how history might have changed? Today, Gibson, Leonard and four of their teammates are in the Washington Nationals’ Ring of Honor. My earliest memories of the Senators are of listening to games on the radio. My brothers were a decade older and got to go to Senators games with my father, just as they got to go to the Redskins and Notre Dame games I burned to see. My father, a D.C. police detective, had been on the security detail protecting President Franklin D. Roosevelt at a traditional opening day game. I cherish a great photograph of him in a fedora and plainclothes watching over the president as Roosevelt stood with the help of his braces to throw out the opening pitch. In 1955, at long last, Dad gave the tickets to me. I invited my best friend, Charlie Sparacino, and the nuns gave us a pass from grade school for opening day. The trolley cars ran straight down Georgia Avenue, six and a half miles from our house to the stadium. As the trolley drew closer to the stadium, we became more excited. Why not? We were tied for first. We joined the crowd entering the stadium, our senses overwhelmed by the mingled smells of hot dogs, peanuts, cotton candy, and the bread baking next door at the Wonder Bread factory.
sports/baseball,We went up the ramp to the upper deck. I looked out in awe on the greenest expanse I’d ever seen. Griffith Stadium was built in 1912. Like most stadiums of that era, it was integrated into the neighborhood. It had a covered grandstand and two decks of seats — bleacher seats in left and center, and a 30-foot wall in right. It seated about 30,000 for baseball and looked like Fenway Park in reverse. The dimensions of the park were so huge that only one Senator hit a home run there in 1945. The team was warming up: Yost at third; Pistol Pete Runnels, a line-drive-hitting infielder; Roy Sievers, acquired from the St. Louis Browns for his long-ball potential; and Mickey Vernon, a first baseman who had won two batting titles. The Senators had a Cuban scout named Joe Cambria, and the team was loaded with players from the Caribbean who worked cheaply and spoke little English. The manager was Chuck Dressen, who had twice guided the Brooklyn Dodgers to the World Series. The opponents were the hated Baltimore Orioles. I gloated as the Senators won, 12-5, to take over first place. But they won only 52 more games that year. I spent much of my time scheming to get back to Griffith Stadium, even persuading my sports-agnostic mother to take my 4-year-old sister, Maureen, and me to a Ladies’ Day game. For my mother, the draw was her favorite radio personality, Arthur Godfrey, who was appearing with his horse after the game.
sports/baseball,But when Maureen became lost coming back from the concession stand, causing my mother to miss the performance of Godfrey, the Old Redhead, she wasn’t eager for an encore. Later that year, my father took me to the stadium to see the first integrated high school football game between the champions of the Catholic and the public schools. Opening day in 1956 found the mighty Yankees in town. I was back in the stands to see Mantle crush two home runs over the center-field wall. That year also brought a major alteration to the stadium. Calvin Griffith, Clark’s adopted son, moved the fences in to take advantage of the power hitters in the lineup; in left field, the fence was moved in 50 feet. On Aug. 9 the first beer was sold at the stadium. Clark Griffith, a prohibitionist, had not allowed beer, further reducing the potential of his meager profits. My biggest thrill came in the summer of 1957. My friend Charlie and I were standing on the trolley car platform clutching our Peterson’s official scorebooks. The platforms were in the middle of the street, forcing the cars to go on either side. A ’56 aqua-and-white Chevrolet convertible pulled up. “You guys going to the game?” the driver said. I was dumbstruck. There sat Runnels, the infielder, and his wife. We jumped in the back seat and desperately tried to think of something to say. I knew all of Runnels’s statistics, but he was in the only slump of his career. We didn’t talk.
sports/baseball,Runnels was traded after the season to Boston, where he won two batting titles and narrowly missed another when Senators pitchers (of all people) held him hitless on the last day of the 1958 season. The construction of the left-field bleachers was completed and designated as the beer garden, where patrons could bask in the sun sipping National Bohemian, the club’s sponsor, as Clark Griffith turned slowly in his grave. In 1959, we had an improved lineup, featuring the power-hitting Harmon Killebrew, Jim Lemon, Sievers and the rookie Bob Allison. Ugly rumors had begun to swirl that Calvin Griffith was flirting with other cities. Teams in Boston, St. Louis and Philadelphia had relocated in the 1950s, but those cities had two teams, and no one thought baseball would leave the nation’s capital with no team. Despite the Senators’ improved roster, attendance still waned, and the team tried all sorts of goofy promotions like Patrol Boy Day and coupon giveaways from the three D.C. dairies. On the last week of the season, my brother Michael took me to a game. The pregame festivities included an egg toss, a home-run-hitting contest and the grand finale, a match race between Pedro Ramos, the team’s fastest runner, and a chicken. The chicken won. The summer of 1960 answered the most fervent dreams of my childhood. The team blossomed. Killebrew and Allison provided power, and Camilo Pascual and Ramos anchored the pitching staff. The Senators won 73 games, the most since 1953. They finished fifth, and winning games seemed to be drawing more fans than races with a chicken.
sports/baseball,I had entered high school by then and was standing on a trolley platform on Oct. 13 when I heard, on a cabdriver’s radio, of the Bill Mazeroski home run that won the 1960 World Series for Pittsburgh. I thought my own team wasn’t that far away. But pernicious forces were at work. The city fathers had agreed to build a new stadium for the Senators and the Redskins. Calvin Griffith, who blamed Griffith Stadium’s inner-city location for the attendance woes, said that the new home, in northeast Washington, would be no better. In 1978, at a Lions Club lunch in Minneapolis, the perfidy was explained in a blast of prejudice: he told the group that he had chosen to move the team to Minnesota “when I found out that you had only 15,000 blacks here.” On Oct. 26, 1960, the owners voted to let Griffith move the team. Still fearful of losing their antitrust exemption, they immediately awarded Washington an expansion team, a collection of the dregs of baseball. Did they actually think no one would care? The Minnesota Twins went to the World Series in 1965 with a core of players still encased in plastic in the binders in my closet. I cared.
sports/soccer,For David Beckham and M.L.S., a Miami Marriage at Last - The New York Times MIAMI — After four years of frustration and dead ends, David Beckham’s efforts to establish a Major League Soccer team here finally bore fruit on Monday with the league’s announcement that it had granted his ownership group an expansion franchise. The league, which had been carefully noncommittal about its future with Beckham and Miami since hosting a similar event with him here in 2014, did little to disguise its excitement this time around. It passed out hundreds of tickets for the lunchtime announcement in a concert hall at the Adrienne Arsht Center, an event with pounding music, enthusiastic celebrity testimonial videos, Las Vegas-style showgirls and boisterous chants from members of the Southern Legion, a local soccer supporters’ group that, until Monday, had no team. There was even confetti. “We’ve been waiting for this moment for 20 years, since the Fusion, and we’re very excited,” said Juan Carlos Aviles, 32, a youth soccer coach, referring to the Miami Fusion, the previous M.L.S. team based here. That club was folded in 2001 after years of poor attendance, the same year that the Tampa Bay Mutiny, another M.L.S. franchise, folded. This time, the league is promising to put its full weight behind the Beckham team. M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber has endured years of skeptical questions about the bid’s many ups and downs, but on Monday he beamed as he told the crowd that he intended to help make the league’s newest team “one of the great clubs of the world.”
sports/soccer,What neither he nor Beckham could provide were any concrete details about the team itself: a name, colors or even when it would begin play. “All that will be rolled out in the coming months,” said Tadd Schwartz, a spokesman for the new club. Beckham and his group were clearly relieved that this day had come. “This is something that has been a dream for many, many years,” said Beckham, a former captain of England’s national team who also played for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Paris St.-Germain and in M.L.S. with the Los Angeles Galaxy. “There were times we said, ‘This dream is not going to happen — there’s too many bumps in the road,’” Beckham added. “But we never gave up.” As part of his original contract with the league from when he joined the Galaxy in 2007, Beckham was given an option to buy a franchise for $25 million at the end of his playing career. A significant figure at the time, it has proved to be a bargain. The owners of the two franchises entering the league in its current round of expansion, in Nashville and a to-be-named city, will pay about $150 million each for their teams. Monday’s announcement was made almost exactly four years after M.L.S. heralded Beckham’s intention to exercise his ownership option. The pledge Beckham received from Garber back then was contingent on Beckham’s group finalizing a stadium plan — a point M.L.S. officials have made publicly and privately for years. Last fall, after reports of wavering confidence in the shifting ownership group and mounting frustration at the league office in New York, the deal appeared all but dead.
sports/soccer,But after a dinner in New York two months ago, a newly configured ownership group came into play, determined to press on. The new members included the billionaire founder of the Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, and the brothers Jorge and José R. Mas, members of one of Miami’s most well-known Cuban exile families and the owners of Mastec, an engineering and construction company based nearby in Coral Gables. The other members of the group are Sprint’s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, and the entertainment mogul Simon Fuller, a longtime associate of Beckham’s. “The stars have aligned,” Carlos A. Giménez, the Miami-Dade County mayor, said in a telephone interview on Monday. “There were a lot of false starts, a lot of obstacles to overcome. David persisted and persisted, and when a door closed, there was always another one.” Beckham’s first plan was to build a stadium in the county-owned PortMiami, but the cruise industry, heavily invested in the harbor, put up roadblocks to the deal. Later proposals included a waterfront site in downtown Miami and another in the Little Havana neighborhood, next to Marlins Park, but both ran into their own crippling hurdles. That “rocky road,” as Claure put it in his remarks on Monday, appeared to have come to an end with the ownership group’s agreement to purchase almost nine acres in Miami’s downtrodden Overtown neighborhood. If all goes well, that site will be home to a 25,000-seat stadium that could cost $500 million. Local officials, embarrassed by a deal for the Miami Marlins stadium that left taxpayers on the hook for $2.4 billion, had balked at helping to underwrite the costs of the soccer venue, and Beckham had to opt for private rather than public financing.
sports/soccer,Although the deal is all but sealed for the Overtown location, at least one legal challenge remains. It concerns part of the proposed site, a 2.8-acre lot owned by the county and used as a storage depot. In a lawsuit filed last summer, Bruce C. Matheson, a wealthy Miami landowner, challenged the county’s approval of the $9 million sale since it had not allowed for competitive bids. County officials argued that Florida law permits such no-bid transactions involving public land if they result in wider economic benefits. In October, a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge dismissed the lawsuit, but Matheson has appealed. In addition, some residents of Overtown, traditionally one of the city’s poorest and most underdeveloped neighborhoods, have objected to the proposed stadium on the grounds that there is no official provision for job creation in the immediate area. But most businesses seem to welcome the prospect of a stadium in their midst. “Talk about stimulating the neighborhood,” said Luis García, whose family has run a seafood restaurant on the Miami River, three blocks south of the proposed soccer venue, since 1966. “I’ve got to believe that local restaurants and bar owners are going to benefit. Consider the demographics: We have the melting pot of Latin America. How come we haven’t had a major soccer team here?”
world/europe,France, Land of Croissants, Finds Butter Vanishing From Shelves - The New York Times PARIS — It’s hard to imagine a country where butter is taken more seriously than it is in France. It’s a staple of sauces and baking, alike. Without it, the croissant would be a leaden mass of flour, and the jambon-beurre sandwich missing a certain something. The Rouen Cathedral is said to have been built in part on the back of butter fees, and even today, in the western region of Brittany, salted butter is something of a religion. So an empty butter shelf in France is like a dry baguette: deeply disconcerting. But with a slump in European dairy production and a surge in world demand, that is exactly what some French are encountering in their stores. Alarmed by news reports about the shortage, Laurence Meyre, a 53-year-old professor shopping in a supermarket in southern Paris one recent morning, said she had made sure to stock up. “I thought to myself: Not having butter in France, that’s appalling,” she said. In truth, the shortages, though noticeable nationwide, have been sporadic, and France gives no appearance of grinding to a halt. But in a country that by some measures consumes more butter per head than anyplace else, that is a fine point. And so French news outlets are giving advice on how to replace butter or to churn your own. One headline asked whether there would be butter for Christmas. The agriculture minister faced questions in Parliament. Online, shoppers shared pictures of empty shelves, and jokers ran fake advertisements offering small amounts of butter for ludicrous prices. Inevitably, a #BeurreGate hashtag popped up.
world/europe,Last year, France consumed about 18 pounds of butter per capita, according to statistics from a coming report by the International Dairy Federation. That is over twice the European Union average, and more than three times the figure in the United States. Gérard Calbrix, the head of economic affairs at the Association of French Dairy Processors, said the industry had been expecting a crunch since spring. “Over the past year, from June of 2016 to this summer, milk production has fallen in Europe,” he said. “At the same time, demand for butter has increased, on all world markets.” Several factors help explain the mismatch, according to Mr. Calbrix and other analysts. Dairy production in Europe, already falling since European Union milk quotas ended in 2015, slumped after the summer of 2016 because of bad yields from fodder crops and unfavorable weather. Meanwhile, as butter has shed some of its unhealthy image, demand has risen worldwide, especially in the United States — where the fast-food chain McDonald’s promised to put butter back in its recipes last year — and in China. In France alone, butter consumption increased 5 percent from 2013 to 2015, according to a recent report by an umbrella organization for France’s dairy industry, Le Cniel. The result? Butter prices have spiked, rising to nearly $8,000 a ton in September from roughly $2,800 in April 2016. But only France has seen shortages, because of the way its food supply chain is organized. In France, Mr. Calbrix explained, prices between suppliers and big retailers are negotiated once a year, in February.
world/europe,“The absence of certain products on shelves is an indicator of tensions between some large retailers and their suppliers,” the Cniel said in its report, noting that many retailers were refusing to pay the increased market price for butter. The government has suggested that fears of a mass shortage are overblown. Stéphane Travert, France’s agriculture minister, acknowledged on Wednesday that pricing disagreements between producers and distributors were keeping butter out of some stores, but he told France Inter radio that “strictly speaking, there is no shortage.” Industries that use butter, like bakeries and pastry shops, have had no choice but to pay up and, in some cases, to pass on their increased costs, according to Matthieu Labbé, the managing director for the Federation of Bakery Companies. Could they make do with cheaper substitutes, like margarine? Don’t even think about it. “There’s no comparison,” Mr. Labbé said. “If you want to preserve the quality of our products, you have to use butter — you can’t do anything else.” Much of the attention over the shortages has focused on France’s butter bastion: Brittany, famous for its crepes and salted-butter caramel. A satirical short film released this month by a collective of local artists imagined, almost presciently, what would happen if the butter ran out. Life in the artists’ butter-deprived Brittany is bleak. Robbers steal it from a restaurant at gunpoint; it is illegally churned by dealers in a motor home, “Breaking Bad”-style, for sale on the black market; and the last slice of kouign-amann — a delicacy whose Breton-language name translates as “butter cake” — is auctioned off.
world/europe,Reality has not been as dire. For La Trinitaine, a family-run maker of local delicacies in the Morbihan region of southern Brittany, it has been slightly harder and more expensive to secure a steady supply of butter, according to Annabelle Cantin, the company’s head of marketing and communications. “Butter and salted butter are part of the founding elements for recipes in Brittany,” she said. “So yes, we are inevitably affected, and have been for several months now.” Jean-Robert Pitte, a geographer and gastronomy specialist at the Sorbonne University in Paris, said that France had traditionally been split between a butter-dominated north and an olive oil-using south, but those divisions had broken down. “When I was little, there was hardly any olive oil in Paris,” Professor Pitte said. “Now, we eat butter everywhere, and we consume olive oil everywhere.” Fernand Point, a revered mid-20th-century chef, famously said, “Butter! Give me butter! Always butter!” but Professor Pitte said France had moved past the butter-heavy style of cooking popularized in the United States by Julia Child. It is unclear how long the shortages will linger. The government argues that production traditionally picks up in the winter, but the industry counters that demand also increases toward Christmas. Some shoppers like Ms. Meyre have stockpiled butter, worsening the scarcity. But when she went back to the supermarket several days after doing so, she found the refrigerated butter shelves still half full. “I’m getting the slight impression that we got scared for nothing,” Ms. Meyre said.
world/europe,The scare was also an opportunity for laughs. In one Twitter post last week, a dairy plant in the Limousin region of central France warned readers about the dangers of “beurre-out,” cautioning that “margarine is not the solution” and sharing its phone number as a mock hotline. “Talk about it with those around you,” the dairy said. “And remember to regularly check in on your friends in Brittany.”
world/europe,Ireland Reconsiders Its Constitutional Ban on Abortion - The New York Times DUBLIN — An assembly of Irish citizens convened by Parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country: the near-total ban on abortions, which has been enshrined in Ireland’s Constitution since 1983. The group, a 100-member Citizens’ Assembly led by Mary Laffoy, a Supreme Court judge, does not have the power to change the law. But its mandate from Parliament — to examine the full range of medical, legal and ethical issues surrounding abortion — suggests a willingness to revisit the ban, one of the most stringent in the Western world. Over the last three months, the assembly has received more than 13,500 comments from the public — more than 1,000 of which have been published online so far. It pored over these submissions at the Grand Hotel Malahide over the weekend, along with testimony from experts, and is scheduled to issue a report later this year. Abortion was already illegal in Ireland before 1983, but the Eighth Amendment gave “the right to life of the unborn” equal status to “the right to life of the mother” under the Constitution. The amendment was enacted through a voter referendum, and can be altered — or abandoned — only via another referendum. Several highly publicized cases since then have contributed to and reflected a shift in the public’s mood, however. In 2012, a 31-year-old woman, Savita Halappanavar, died from septic shock while having a miscarriage, after a hospital denied her an abortion that might have saved her life.
world/europe,And last year, a United Nations committee ruled that Ireland had violated a woman’s rights by forcing her to travel abroad for an abortion even though severe congenital defects had been diagnosed in the fetus. Legal uncertainty over how to define “the unborn” has long dogged the amendment, and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel’s criticisms. It is common for women in Ireland to travel to countries such as Britain and the Netherlands for abortions. Figures from Britain’s National Health Service showed that more than 3,400 women gave Irish addresses to British abortions clinics in 2015. That said, Ireland remains a conservative society, and the Roman Catholic Church opposes any change in the law. “We believe that every unborn child, irrespective of his or her medical condition or the circumstances of his or her birth, has the right to be treated equally before the law,” the bishops’ conference said in a statement. Submissions posted online expressed a wide range of views, with many of them offering deeply personal perspectives. Leslie Spillane, a woman in her 20s from Cork, in southwestern Ireland, wrote that several of her friends had traveled abroad to terminate their pregnancies. “These friends of mine are also the lucky ones, they have been able to borrow the money for the travel, and they have had friends they could tell,” she wrote. “Abortions happen, everyday. Making them illegal doesn’t stop woman needing, or wanting them, or inflicting them on themselves — there will always be coat hangers, broken bottles, painkillers, stairs to fall down, fists to hit, medicines to swallow.”
world/europe,In a phone interview, she said that “even if you don’t agree with abortion, it’s not morally acceptable to force your views onto others.” Defenders of the law were equally adamant. “Abortion, in our firm belief, is the taking of human life irrespective of the stage of pregnancy,” wrote Kathleen Gleeson and her husband, Raymond Gleeson, from County Kerry, in southwestern Ireland. Valerie Marjoram, a woman in her 30s in County Kildare, just west of Dublin, described herself as a feminist who opposed abortion on religious grounds. “I find it appalling that a certain brand of feminism would put more effort into obtaining the legal sanction of murdering one’s own child than fighting for the right to carry a child to term without losing one’s pay, career path, promotion, college place,” she said in a phone interview. “The fact that abortion is legal in any country has led to a culture of selfishness where even life can be rescheduled if it happens at the ‘wrong time.’” The Eighth Amendment has been subject to legal and political challenges over the years. In 1992, Ireland’s highest court upheld the right to an abortion if the mother’s life is at risk, including from suicide, but how to interpret that right remains in dispute. In 1992, voters approved an amendment to the Constitution to allow women to travel abroad for abortions and to receive information about abortion services abroad. And in that year, and again in 2002, voters rejected amendments that would have removed the threat of suicide as grounds for a legal abortion.
world/europe,Conor O’Mahony, a lecturer in law at University College Cork, says the continued contentiousness reveals problems with the wording of the ban. “The Eighth Amendment doesn’t work as a means of regulating abortion, whether you are coming from the anti-abortion or abortion rights perspective,” he said in a phone interview. “And the evidence I would give you is that neither side has ever been happy with how that amendment has been interpreted and applied over the years.” He said that public opinion had been gradually shifting in favor of legalizing abortion — particularly in cases involving severe fetal abnormalities or rape — but predicted that the debate would continue for years even if a referendum was to take place in the near future. Gerard Whyte, a professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, said in a phone interview that it would be unwise to simply repeal the amendment, as some abortion-rights advocates seek. “If there is no constitutional protection for the unborn, then there is a problem and we’re into uncharted territory,” he said. “I’m simply warning about a situation whereby people decide to repeal the Eighth but don’t add anything else.”
sports/golf,At British Open, Caddies Have Their Golfers’ Bags, and Backs - The New York Times
opinion,Palestinians and the U.N. - The New York Times In little more than a month, the Palestinians are expected to ask the United Nations to recognize their state. We have sympathy for their yearning and their frustration. For years, they have been promised a negotiated solution — President Obama called for a peace deal by September — and they are still empty-handed. But the consequences could be profoundly damaging for all involved. If the Palestinians want full U.N. membership, they have to win the backing of the Security Council. The United States will undoubtedly veto any resolution, and that will further isolate both Israel and Washington. The Palestinians may instead ask the General Assembly to recognize them as a state or give them observer status as a state. Either would undoubtedly pass. But it would be in name only. After the initial exhilaration, Palestinians would be even more alienated, while extremists would try to exploit that disaffection. The best way, likely the only way, to head off this debacle is with the start of serious negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The two sides haven’t even been in the same room together since September 2010. All share blame for the stalemate. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has used any excuse he can find (regional turmoil, the weakness of his coalition government) to avoid negotiations. He has blustered and balked at President Obama’s prodding. Republican leaders in Washington — who seem mainly interested in embarrassing Mr. Obama — have encouraged his resistance.
opinion,Arab leaders haven’t given the Israelis any incentive to compromise. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, seemed to give up on diplomacy when Mr. Obama could not deliver a promised settlement freeze. We see no sign that he has thought even one step beyond the U.N. vote. With the September deadline approaching, the Obama administration is back in the business of incremental diplomacy. The White House is working with Israel and the Quartet (the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations) on a statement setting out parameters for negotiations. The core element: a Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with mutually agreed land swaps and guarantees for Israel’s security. In May, President Obama endorsed that idea, which is widely accepted as the basis of any deal. At the time, Mr. Netanyahu scored points with hard-liners in Israel — and Republican lawmakers played the same game here — denouncing those boundaries as “indefensible.” Now the Israeli leader seems willing to accept them. It’s a start but not enough. To have any chance of inducing the Palestinians to drop their statehood bid — and finally move the peace process forward — the United States and its partners should put a map and a deal on the table, with a timeline for concluding negotiations and a formal U.N. statehood vote. The Security Council and the Arab League need to throw their full weight behind it. We see no sign that Washington or the Israelis are thinking beyond the incremental. The United States can veto a statehood resolution. But all sides will end up paying a high price.
technology,First-Weekend Sales of Apple’s iPhone 6 Models Top 10 Million - The New York Times Apple’s investors obsess over early iPhone sales like Hollywood producers tracking opening ticket sales for a blockbuster movie. A big weekend is usually a healthy predictor of consumer demand for the holiday season — not just for Apple, but for the entire consumer electronics industry. Those Apple watchers can rest easy because the company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are no bust. Apple said on Monday that it had sold 10 million units of its new and bigger iPhones over the weekend, up from the nine million iPhones it sold last year in the first weekend of sales for the previous generation of iPhones. The iPhone is still Apple’s biggest cash cow, accounting for about 70 percent of its profit. So early sales can help predict quarterly or even annual results for the company, based in Cupertino, Calif. Now the momentum from the new iPhones’ strong opening weekend is expected to help carry Apple to record sales this holiday quarter. Maynard Um, a senior research analyst for Wells Fargo, predicts Apple will sell about 58 million iPhones in the holiday quarter, up from 51 million in that period a year ago. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, estimates Apple will sell 55 million to 60 million iPhones in the holiday season. The weekend iPhone sales, which were a record for Apple, were on the upper end of financial analysts’ predictions, which ranged from 6.5 million to the “low teens” of millions of units.
technology,The early results also reflect consumer demand for bigger phone screens. Both new iPhones have much larger screens than the 4 inches of earlier versions: the iPhone 6’s screen is 4.7 inches diagonal and the 6 Plus is 5.5 inches diagonal. The only real surprise to some analysts is that Apple held out so long before releasing smartphones that kept pace with large-screen competitors from companies like Samsung Electronics, HTC and Nokia, which have been offering so-called phablets — a blurring of the line between a phone and a tablet computing device — for several years. “It’s really unusual that a company avoids a hot product category as long as Apple has been avoiding phablets,” said Tero Kuittinen, a managing director for Frank N. Magid Associates, a technology research company. “Every other vendor jumped on the phablet train.” As is typical with Apple product introductions, some customers stayed up late to order the new iPhones online while others slept in garbage bags outside Apple Stores. But notably, none of them were in China. Apple has delayed the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus there, apparently because the devices have not received approval from Chinese regulators. IDC, a research company, estimated that at least 20 percent of all smartphones shipped last year in China, the largest smartphone market, were five inches or larger. “Even without China, Apple was able to move $6.5 billion of product in three days, which would be impressive for any industry,” said Walter Piecyk, managing director at BTIG Research.
technology,Apple’s share price rose slightly Monday, ending the day up 0.1 percent to $101.06. Still, some analysts, like Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray, wondered whether first-weekend sales were still a reliable measure of consumer demand. The iPhone is already immensely popular in many countries, he noted before Apple’s weekend results, so early sales may be more of a sign of how many iPhones can initially be produced by Apple and its manufacturing partners. “The first-weekend iPhone sales number continues to be more about how much Apple can supply than what the demand is in the market,” Mr. Piecyk said. Timothy D. Cook, chief executive of Apple, said as much on Monday. “We could have sold many more iPhones with greater supply, and we are working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible,” he said in a statement. The introduction of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus was the second time Apple released two new iPhones at the same time. Last year, it introduced the iPhone 5S with the iPhone 5C, a colorful plastic model sold at a lower price. Apple is not treating the iPhone 5C like past iPhones. Traditionally, Apple has upgraded each iPhone once a year, with improvements like faster chips and better cameras. However, this month, instead of announcing an upgrade for the iPhone 5C, Apple said it would continue to sell the exact same iPhone, but for less: free with a contract.
technology,Analysts say that it appears Apple’s strategy all along for the iPhone 5C was to sell an older, plastic iPhone over a longer period to allow the costs of production and components to drop. That lets Apple decrease the price of the plastic iPhone and increase market share in less affluent markets. Although Apple is late to the party with bigger phones, Samsung of South Korea could suffer the most. Samsung, the largest handset maker, has relied heavily on larger screens as a selling point for its popular Galaxy smartphones. Mr. Kuittinen of Magid Associates said that Samsung’s smartphone sales were already slowing before Apple introduced larger iPhones. So this holiday season could look grim for Samsung and other handset makers. “It’s going to be a very scary Christmas for HTC, Samsung and LG,” he said. “This is really going to be crunch time.”
business/dealbook,Barclays Plans to Sell 12 Percent Stake in African Business - The New York Times LONDON — Barclays said on Wednesday that it planned to sell a 12.2 percent stake in the Barclays Africa Group as it moves to reduce its holdings in the business in an accelerated strategy shift led by its new chief executive. The British bank announced plans in March to sell down its 62.3 percent stake in the African business over the next two to three years, and James E. Staley, its chief executive, said the action announced Wednesday was “an important first step.” Barclays, which has operated in the region for more than a century, wants to reduce its holdings in the African business to below a controlling level or sell the stake entirely. The goal is to free Barclays from regulatory and capital requirements that have dragged on its balance sheet. “We continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options,” said Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, in a news release. The Barclays African business is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and holds majority stakes in banks in 10 countries, with offices in two others. The business’s biggest profit driver is South Africa. The African business was considered one of four pillars of Barclays’s strategy, alongside its credit card and its consumer and investment banking operations, under Antony Jenkins, who was ousted as chief executive in July.
business/dealbook,Under Mr. Staley, the bank is accelerating the sale of businesses it does not consider core operations and focusing its strategy around two divisions: the British consumer bank, and the corporate and investment bank. Barclays said it would sell 103.6 million shares, or 12.2 percent of the business, in a private offering to institutional investors. The Public Investment Corporation, an investment manager owned by the South African government, has agreed to serve as an anchor investor in the sale, buying up to 10.3 million shares, or about 1.2 percent of Barclays Africa. The announcement of the planned sale came just over a week after Atlas Mara Limited, an investment company backed by the former Barclays chief executive Robert E. Diamond Jr., said it was in discussions with a group of investors about exploring a bid for Barclays’s African business. Atlas Mara was formed in 2013 to invest in financial services companies in Africa. Barclays’s investment bank will serve as the sole global coordinator on the offering.
us,Pope Francis’ Remarks to Victims of Sexual Abuse - The New York Times Following are Pope Francis’ remarks to victims of abuse on Sunday. The remarks were released by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops: My dearest brothers and sisters in Christ, I am grateful for this opportunity to meet you, I am blessed by your presence. Thank you for coming here today. Words cannot fully express my sorrow for the abuse you suffered. You are precious children of God who should always expect our protection, our care and our love. I am profoundly sorry that your innocence was violated by those who you trusted. In some cases the trust was betrayed by members of your own family, in other cases by priests who carry a sacred responsibility for the care of soul. In all circumstances, the betrayal was a terrible violation of human dignity. For those who were abused by a member of the clergy, I am deeply sorry for the times when you or your family spoke out, to report the abuse, but you were not heard or believed. Please know that the Holy Father hears you and believes you. I deeply regret that some bishops failed in their responsibility to protect children. It is very disturbing to know that in some cases bishops even were abusers. I pledge to you that we will follow the path of truth wherever it may lead. Clergy and bishops will be held accountable when they abuse or fail to protect children.
us,We are gathered here in Philadelphia to celebrate God’s gift of family life. Within our family of faith and our human families, the sins and crimes of sexual abuse of children must no longer be held in secret and in shame. As we anticipate the Jubilee Year of Mercy, your presence, so generously given despite the anger and pain you have experienced, reveals the merciful heart of Christ. Your stories of survival, each unique and compelling, are powerful signs of the hope that comes from the Lord’s promise to be with us always. It is good to know that you have brought family members and friends with you today. I am grateful for their compassionate support and pray that many people of the Church will respond to the call to accompany those who have suffered abuse. May the Door of Mercy be opened wide in our dioceses, our parishes, our homes and our hearts, to receive those who were abused and to seek the path to forgiveness by trusting in the Lord. We promise to support your continued healing and to always be vigilant to protect the children of today and tomorrow. When the disciples who walked with Jesus on the road to Emmaus recognized that He was the Risen Lord, they asked Jesus to stay with them. Like those disciples, I humbly beg you and all survivors of abuse to stay with us, to stay with the Church, and that together, as pilgrims on the journey of faith, we might find our way to the Father.
sports/golf,Thorbjorn Olesen and Kevin Kisner Lead the P.G.A. Championship - The New York Times CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Kevin Kisner and Thorbjorn Olesen emerged as the top survivors on a Quail Hollow course with some of the fastest, scariest putting surfaces the P.G.A. Championship has ever seen. And both had to watch lengthy birdie putts creep into the cup on the 18th hole to share the lead at four-under 67. For all the talk about this 7,600-yard course favoring the big hitters, the shortest club in the bag turned out to be just as valuable. “Any time you have a putt down grain, downhill, we just tap it and hope it stops by the hole,” Jon Rahm said after a 70. Jordan Spieth is among the best putters in golf, especially from long range. On consecutive holes, he ran long putts some 10 feet by the cup and made bogey. He saved his round with two late birdies for a one-over 72 and still was just five shots behind. Spieth, 24, would become the sixth, and youngest, player to complete a career grand slam if he were to win the P.G.A. Championship. Brooks Koepka, the United States Open champion, led five players at 68. He missed a half-dozen putts from 12 feet or closer, and while it looked as though he hit the ball well enough to go low at Quail Hollow, he was not the least bit frustrated.
sports/golf,“It’s going to test your patience one way or another,” Koepka said. “That’s just a major. You’ve got to stay patient. You can’t make doubles out here. That’s the big thing. Make sure the worst score you make is a bogey and give yourself a couple of good chances on the easier holes.” That is the way Kisner approached it. It helps that he grew up in the South and loves Bermuda greens. Given the size of Quail Hollow, Kisner drew up a simple plan. He identified four or five holes where he could make birdie, and he played for par everywhere else. “I birdied them all today,” Kisner, 33, said. “Make a lot of pars, and get to a par 5 or one of those short par 4s, I can do my wedge game and get it to 10 or 12 feet. That’s my plan. Other than that, I’m playing for par.” The 18th was not one of the birdie holes he had in mind, especially with his ball nestled in the Bermuda rough 205 yards from the pin. Kisner thought the grass was thin enough behind the ball to get a 5-iron on it, and from there it was a matter of judging how much it would bounce. It ran up to the green about 20 feet away, and he used that rhythmic putting stroke to trickle it into the cup. Olesen, a 27-year-old Dane, picked up birdies on most of the same holes, and he finished with a 30-foot birdie that also sounded like an accident.
sports/golf,“It was a little bit of a safe shot into the green,” he said. “That’s what can happen on this golf course. When you play safe into the greens, you give yourself very tricky putts, like the one I had — downhill, left-to-right. It was very, very fast. But it was just a very good roll. So it was nice to see that one drop.” Rickie Fowler made plenty of birdies, and he needed them to offset his triple bogey on the sixth hole. Rory McIlroy, the betting favorite coming into the week because of his two victories at Quail Hollow, was motoring along just fine when he birdied the 10th hole to reach two-under, just two shots behind. One swing changed everything. He hooked his tee shot into the water on the reachable par-4 14th, had to drop in nasty rough and missed a short putt to make double bogey. He failed to birdie the par-5 15th and closed with three pars for a 72. Hideki Matsuyama, Dustin Johnson and Jason Day were among those at one-under 70. Quail Hollow played to an average score of 74.7, making the P.G.A. Championship look like the toughest test of the year in the majors. The P.G.A. Championship typically features good scoring because it is held in August when water has to be kept on the greens to keep them from dying.
sports/golf,The club switched to Bermuda grass, and with the undulation on the greens, it became a beast to play. The 67s were the highest score to lead the opening round of the P.G.A. Championship since Matt Kuchar shot 67 at Whistling Straits in 2010. Phil Mickelson failed to make a single birdie — the second straight major that has happened — and shot a 79, his worst score ever in the P.G.A. Championship. Ernie Els, who might be playing his final P.G.A., matched his worst score in the championship with an 80. He also shot 80 when he was 22 playing his first one at Bellerive in 1992.

arts,The Secret of Success in a Chilly Classic Car Market - The New York Times PARIS — “It’s a real kerplunk.” José Luis Celada smiled with satisfaction as he closed the rear passenger door on his 1951 Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 S. “That’s a really strong door,” he added. “All four of them are like that.” Mr. Celada, 65, a collector based in Buenos Aires, had just bought the immaculate maroon Alfa saloon for 143,750 euros, or about $177,000, at an RM Sotheby’s auction in Paris on Feb. 7. The car, thought to be one of just 17 surviving examples of the model, sold for far less than the presale estimate of €175,000. The result and the buyer were both typical of the trading in classic automobiles in Paris during the 43rd annual Retromobile fair and its accompanying auctions. Demand has cooled considerably since 2013, when prices soared as much as 62 percent for collectible Ferraris, for instance, making classic cars the hottest “passion investment.” Equivalent Ferraris increased 2.5 percent in value in 2017, according to an index compiled by Historic Auto Group International, based in London. “The market has gone down. It’s flat,” said Mr. Celada, who owns a dozen classic cars and who regularly participates in historic rallies. Mr. Celada said that his collecting field had attracted “a lot of people who didn’t know about cars who were just interested in investment.” They now appeared to be less active, he said, leaving the market once again to specialists like him.
arts,RM Sotheby’s 84-lot sale was the first of three major classic car auctions held during the week. Bonhams followed with 228 lots on Thursday, and the Paris auctioneers Artcurial with 250 lots on Friday. With buyers more selective, owners are more reluctant to offer exceptional cars at auction. When they do, expectations can be out of step with new realities. Last month, during a bellwether series of sales in Arizona, two 1950s Jaguar D-Type racers, estimated at $12 million at RM Sotheby’s and $10 million at Gooding & Co., failed to sell. The top end of the car auction market also had some misfires in Paris. Artcurial’s star lot, a 1963 Ferrari 275 P that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race, was expected to sell for more than €20 million, but was withdrawn before the sale. The car had been owned by the French collector Pierre Bardinon, whose estate remains subject to legal proceedings. At RM Sotheby’s, only two of the five lots estimated to sell for more than €2 million managed to find buyers. The evening was topped by a 2017 Bugatti Chiron, which sold to a telephone bidder for €3.3 million with fees, just above the low estimate. With an electronically limited top speed of 260 miles per hour, this road car — one of the first 20 of the 500 Chirons manufactured — bucked new models’ reputation for value depreciation: Last year’s list price was €2.4 million.
arts,The Paris auctions posted an aggregate €70.9 million, down from the €86 million achieved at the equivalent auctions in 2015. The 2015 auction market “was a boom. Everyone was afraid of missing a car,” said Bodie Hage, founder of Real Art on Wheels, a classic car dealership based in the Netherlands. “There were a lot of opportunists around, and because of that a lot of collectors started selling.” Mr. Hage, 29, entered a grime-encrusted 1965 Porsche 912 into the RM Sotheby’s sale. Regardless of the state of the market, an untouched “barn find” usually creates a stir at auction. It proved to be one of the few lots to sell over estimate at RM Sotheby’s, reaching €92,000 with fees against an upper valuation of €70,000. In the absence of the rarest 1960s Ferraris, the Bugatti marque captured the top prices at all three auctions. At Bonhams, a 1935 3.3-liter Bugatti Type 57 Torpedo Tourist Trophy that Earl Howe raced in the Ulster TT sold for €713,000. The following day, Artcurial took €2.9 million for a 1938 Type 57C Atalante coupe. Both prices were below presale expectations. Artcurial had by far the biggest-grossing sale, with €31.8 million, but it offered more vehicles than either of its competitors. These auctions of automotive classics are increasingly being bulked up with modern cars. The many Porsche 911 variants are the most obvious example, representing for some collectors a more affordable, more dependable investment than a 1930s Bugatti or a 1960s Ferrari.
arts,“Porsches are good for a timid buyer. They keep working,” Nick Bartman, a British collector, said at the Bonhams auction, where a 1973 Porsche 911 S 2.4-liter Targa sold for a low estimate of €145,833. Mr. Bartman, 63, said that the investment value of older cars could be undermined by mechanical failure. “If you’re looking for 5 or 10 percent, you don’t want the gearbox to go,” he said. “Spares are expensive.” Many more of the week’s most prized cars were to be seen, if not bought, among the 550 exhibitors at Retromobile. The Zurich dealer Lukas Huni displayed no fewer than 10 Ferrari 250 GT SWB racers; none were officially for sale, but experts valued them at €7 million to €15 million each, depending on their histories. Fewer than 180 of these highly competitive coupes were made from 1959 to 1962. “That’s car porn,” said Nick Aaldering, the co-owner of Gallery Aaldering, a dealership based in Brummen, the Netherlands. His nearby stand featured a glamorous, recently restored 1967 Ferrari 275 GTS Pininfarina Spyder convertible. An Irish collector bought it for €1.7 million. “We had three fantastic years when everyone was talking about investment and cars performing better than stocks,” said Mr. Aaldering, 37. “Now we’re back to a normal kind of classic car business. I’m glad.” “Cars have to be top quality, with a clean history, good documentation and certification, and the right price,” Mr. Aaldering said, adding that two years ago his Ferrari Spyder would have been tagged at €1.9 million.
arts,But will wealthy collectors want to keep buying gas-guzzling sportsters when everyone else is zipping around in self-driving electric cars? Mr. Aaldering said he thought that there would still be a market in 20 years’ time for the rarest and most prestigious postwar classic cars. “But they have to be drivable,” he said. If not, your investment could go kerplunk.
theater,This Podcast Is a Love Story, for Your Ears Only - The New York Times When did you last cry in front of another person? What is your most treasured memory? When did you realize that the future of musical theater might just take the form of a podcast? In “36 Questions,” the composers Chris Littler and Ellen Winter and the sound designer Joel Raabe have created a radically intimate, slightly twee and seriously winning musical. So far, anyway. The first act began on July 10. Act II (which I’ve previewed) will drop on Monday, and Act III two weeks later. All three parts are podcast episodes, distributed free of charge. “36 Questions” sounds like a lot of musicals. It has a pop score goosed with blues and indie rock, endearingly quirky characters, wry lyrics. But here’s what it doesn’t have: sets, costumes, chorus, lights, anything except two pealing voices and a glut of sound effects. In the first act, the lyrics find Judith Ford driving down a deserted road on the way to see her husband, Jase Connolly, who walked out on her two weeks earlier. In his defense, he had learned that she had been using an assumed name and she wouldn’t tell him why. The couple fell in love two years before when they asked each other 36 questions derived from a social psychology research paper (“The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness: A Procedure and Some Preliminary Findings”) and popularized by a Modern Love column. Now Judith thinks that if she can persuade Jase to redo the 36 questions — this time offering honest answers — she can resuscitate their marriage. In its acute focus on a troubled relationship, the show is a little like “The Last Five Years,” if “The Last Five Years” nixed the dual timelines in favor of some dorky board-game jokes.
theater,Judith is voiced by Jessie Shelton (“Hadestown”) and Jase by Jonathan Groff (“Frozen,” “Hamilton”). Jase’s pet duck is uncredited, and if that duck dies a tragic, Éponine-esque death in the third act, hey, confit for all. As directed by Mr. Littler and Ms. Winter, Act I — which has already racked up 28,000 downloads and topped the charts at Pocket Cast — is disarmingly conversational and musically shrewd. The dialogue geeks out at times — O.K., a lot of the time — but the songs are booby-trapped with hooks. And the people crooning them into your earbuds feel bracingly, embraceably real. “36 Questions” was conceived by Skip Bronkie and Zack Akers of Two-Up Productions — a team whose previous podcast effort, the creepy, distinctly unmusical “Limetown,” was an adrenaline cascade disguised as docudrama. So a romantic chamber musical must have felt like an obvious next step. What makes the “36 Questions” project that much more surprising is that it’s very likely the first (mostly) serious musical of the podcast era and a gauntlet thrown to any composer daunted by the hassle and cost of a live production. Plenty of radio dramas draw on theatrical forms, and lots of podcasts have strong musical components, from stalwarts like “Prairie Home Companion” to newer ones like the “Welcome to Night Vale” spinoff “The Orbiting Human Circus (of the Air)” or Jemaine Clement’s “The Mysterious Secrets of Uncle Bertie’s Botanarium.”
theater,As if Lin-Manuel Miranda didn’t have enough accolades already, you can credit him with helping pioneer the podcast musical genre with “21 Chump Street,” a 14-minute, crazily likable piece he wrote for an episode of “This American Life.” A few longer entries have followed, like the episodic sci-fi series “Songonauts”; the “Serial” parody “Wait Wait Don’t Kill Me”; and the manically incomprehensible “The Fall of the House of Sunshine,” with songs by the composer Matthew roi Berger. But “36 Questions” is a full-length and more or less traditional book musical written expressly for the podcast form. Ms. Winter and Mr. Littler, who play in a nerdcore group called Chamber Band and cite Stephen Sondheim and Esperanza Spalding as among their influences, had to learn how to write a musical and how to make that musical intelligible to the headphone set. After all, not every musical would work as a podcast. “A Little Night Music” or “The Secret Garden”? Probably. “Miss Saigon” or “Starlight Express”? Probably not. And this differs from an original cast recording, a newly popular genre, in that it’s not a record of another phenomenon. The podcast is the thing itself. “There was a big learning curve,” Mr. Littler said in a phone interview. Ms. Winter added, “It was a lot of balancing the writing with the sound effects we were hearing and imagining.”
theater,Early on, they dismissed the easy out of having an external narrator, a typical podcast trope, and decided to loop the two singers’ voices into multipart harmonies to avoid the need for a chorus. After settling on a quiet mix of live and electronic instrumentation, they structured each episode as a series of voice memos that Judith records on her phone. The result? A show that sounds like eavesdropping on a talky pair who just happen to vault into a tangy soprano and a boyish lyric tenor whenever emotions run high. It’s like having a front-row seat — or sitting even closer than that. “Every breath and sigh and inhale and exhale reads on the microphone,” Mr. Groff said by telephone. “Everything is like a close-up on the voice. The microphone picks up everything, every vocal gesture.” That’s a kind of intimacy that maybe only a command performance can offer. But a podcast can reach a lot more people than even a Broadway long-runner, without the lotteries, the rushes, the scalpers, the hurried preshow meals and obstructed views. It is free, and it sounds as if it was recorded just for you. Two episodes in, “36 Questions” is a charmer. (I’ve even forgiven it for the duck. Mostly.) It’s made me greedy for the finale and for Ms. Winter and Mr. Littler to write for an actual wood-and-plaster stage. But it’s most exciting in the challenge it sets other composers to turn their treble clefs to podcasting. “This format works,” Mr. Littler said.
theater,I’d like to think that listening to “36 Questions” will have musical theater writers asking themselves about the form. Maybe they’ll even fall in love.
nyregion,Fritz Koenig, Sculptor of Trade Center ‘Sphere,’ Dies at 92 - The New York Times Fritz Koenig hoped to see his monumental “Sphere” — a sculptural symbol of the promise, destruction and resilience of the original World Trade Center — return to its intended site in Lower Manhattan. But the effort to bring the battered artwork home, like every other element of the trade center redevelopment project, was waylaid by battles over political and physical turf. As it stands now, Mr. Koenig’s 27-foot-high bronze sculpture, still badly scarred from the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, is not scheduled to return to the trade center from a nearby park until late summer or early fall. But when he died on Feb. 22 at 92 at his home in Ganslberg, Germany, he knew at least that the fate of his “Sphere” finally seemed secure. When the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which had commissioned the work a half-century ago, committed itself last July to reinstalling the sculpture at the World Trade Center, Mr. Koenig was said to be “electrified.” “He is now 92 years old but still very interested in the fate of his ‘child,’” Stefanje Weinmayr of the Fritz and Maria Koenig Foundation in Landshut, Germany, said at the time. The foundation confirmed his death last week. Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority, said Mr. Koenig’s “memory will live on in the ‘Sphere’ that will soon stand in the World Trade Center’s Liberty Park.”
nyregion,“Sphere” was the best known of his sculptures, though Mr. Koenig produced powerful memorials, including one at the former Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. Born on June 20, 1924, in Wurzburg, Mr. Koenig served in the German Army, on the eastern front, during World War II. From 1946 to 1952, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Anton Hiller. His first one-man show in the United States was at the Staempfli Gallery in Manhattan in 1961. “In such unusual sculptural subjects as racehorses crossing the finish line, or in a majestic modern version of a quadriga, where energy seems to explode from within the mass,” Stuart Preston wrote in The New York Times, “he achieves a concentration of animal power that is most impressive.” Six years later, Mr. Koenig was among five sculptors commissioned by the Port Authority to produce artworks for the World Trade Center, then being planned. The twin towers were to be the tallest buildings in the world, though they were soon surpassed by the Sears Tower in Chicago. Minoru Yamasaki, the chief architect of the trade center, was his real patron, Mr. Koenig said. “Yamasaki kept asking me to make the sculpture bigger and bigger to complement his design, but I wanted to make something in contrast,” Mr. Koenig told The Times in 2001. What resulted was “Sphere” (or “Grosse Kugelkaryatide,” the large spherical caryatid). Its smooth golden surface was sliced by incisions and shattered in some places by Cubist eruptions.
nyregion,Because it stood in a fountain in a center dedicated to world trade, the sculpture could easily have been taken for a globe. But Mr. Koenig described it as “a head, and a Cyclops” and “in some ways a self-portrait.” Some viewers saw the head as wearing a helmet. “Laughingly, I said to Yamasaki, ‘The helmet is there because when your towers fall, I don’t want my head to be crushed by them,’” Mr. Koenig recalled in 2001. “I was joking, of course, but who knows why I said that?” At Mauthausen, Mr. Koenig created a harrowing tableau to serve as the West German memorial. At the juncture of two broad planes, and dwarfed by them, are what appear to be a sphere and four rods. After a moment’s study, however, a human figure reveals itself, huddled, emaciated, shivering — if it is alive at all. It was finished in 1983. In 1993, Mr. Koenig and his wife, Maria, donated their property to the city of Landshut, which agreed to build a museum for his sculptures and the artwork he collected. The museum opened in 1998. Maria Koenig died in 2010. Mr. Koenig is survived by his partner, Irmtraud Scheiwe, and two half sisters, Ursula Fürstin Ezterhazy and Christine Schneider. A 1995 memorial by Mr. Koenig in Munich honors the 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer who were killed at the 1972 Summer Olympics by Palestinian terrorists. It is a 30-foot-wide granite beam — “a boundary stone of life” — inscribed with the victims’ names.
nyregion,Terrorism was about to cast a much longer shadow. After being hit by jetliners commandeered by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001, the twin towers collapsed around “Sphere.” Nearly 3,000 people were killed. Astonishingly, the sculpture emerged from the wreckage in recognizable form. On March 11, 2002, six months later, it was made the centerpiece of the city’s mourning, rededicated as an interim memorial in the Battery, a park at the tip of Manhattan. Ten years later, “Sphere” had drifted to the edge of civic consciousness, though it remained an arresting stop for visitors. The nonprofit conservancy that runs the park did not want the sculpture any longer. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center did not want the work at all. The Port Authority said it wanted to return “Sphere” to the site. But it would not say where, when or how. Michael Burke, whose brother, Capt. William F. Burke Jr. of the Fire Department, was killed in the 2001 attack, led a campaign to repatriate the Koenig sculpture. “Had plain common sense and respect for history and adherence to precedent prevailed — imagine the U.S.S. Arizona memorial without the U.S.S. Arizona — the ‘Sphere’ would have been back before 2011 and Koenig may well have been there,” Mr. Burke said last week. Despite that frustration, he said he was grateful that the sculpture would return. “However humble,” Mr. Burke said, “it is an expression of the human endeavor that triumphed over those who hate.”
nyregion,And given its intended place in Liberty Park, 25 feet above street level, it may be more visible than ever.

upshot,For Incarcerated Japanese-Americans, Baseball Was ‘Wearing the American Flag’ - The New York Times After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, some Americans expected Major League Baseball to be suspended until World War II was won. Many of the players would want to enlist, they argued, and letting baseball go on as usual might be frivolously disrespectful of the nation’s war effort. But President Franklin Roosevelt disagreed. In what came to be called his “green light letter,” he wrote the longtime baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an ex-federal judge who was the first to hold the job, that baseball games would give Americans “a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work.” “Even if the actual quality of the teams is lowered by the greater use of older players,” F.D.R. insisted, “this will not dampen the popularity of the sport.” Landis agreed, and baseball provided a vital respite and tonic for an anxious, overworked country at war. Still, this did not prove to be the national pastime’s only contribution to the home front. A month after writing Judge Landis, Roosevelt issued his now-notorious Executive Order 9066, which resulted in the brutal and abrupt forced removal of more than 110,000 people of Japanese descent, about two-thirds of them United States citizens, to 10 remote, quickly constructed “War Relocation Centers.” The first was at Manzanar, close by the Sierra Nevada, in the apple-growing region of central California. Here, surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers, about 10,000 inmates were crowded into barracks, with communal, unisex showers and latrines without partitions.
upshot,During Manzanar’s second year, Ansel Adams, renowned for his natural images of an almost primordial American West, got permission to photograph the camp — under severe restrictions by censors (off limits, for instance, were armed guards, searchlights and watch towers). Adams was determined to discover, in this “nightmare situation,” how these human beings, “suffering under a great injustice,” had “overcome the sense of defeat and despair.” He soon realized that one key to the puzzle was baseball, which moved him to make this photograph. The male inmates of Manzanar (now a National Historic Site) formed almost 100 baseball teams, the females 14. Some used names from squads they had played on before the Pearl Harbor attack, like the San Fernando Aces and the San Pedro Gophers. Drawing large crowds, their sandlot games elevated morale by allowing the internees to recapture at least one vestige of their prewar lives. “Without baseball, camp life would have been miserable,” said George Omachi, who was interned in Arkansas. (He later became a major league scout.) By 1943, when some of those in the relocation camps were allowed to volunteer for war service, some of the ballplayers joined the Army’s almost all-Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which suffered grievous casualties in Europe and came to be called the most decorated military unit in American history.
upshot,Perhaps the most moving characteristic of the games in those World War II camps is that many of the inmates considered playing baseball a weapon with which, amid their hourly humiliations, they could assert their own Americanism. As one internee at Manzanar, Takeo Suo, recalled, “Putting on a baseball uniform was like wearing the American flag.” The son of an inmate at the Minidoka camp in Idaho, Ken Mochizuki, said the same thing in the title of the children’s story he wrote about the subject. His book is called “Baseball Saved Us.”
world/europe,He Was Convicted for Being Gay. 42 Years Later, He Wants an Apology. - The New York Times George Montague has been many things during his long and colorful life: World War II veteran, entrepreneur, father, grandfather, Scout leader — and criminal.  In 1974, he was convicted of gross indecency under a British law that targeted gay men.  Last week, the government announced it would issue a blanket posthumous pardon to thousands of these men, but that those still living — as many as 65,000 — would have to apply. Mr. Montague, who lives in Brighton, England, says he wants an apology, not a pardon.  I’m the happiest old gay guy there is, and every day I tell at least one person this, but I can’t get this gross indecency thing out of my head. For some reason, I just woke up one day at 93 and said I have to do something about it. If you accept the pardon, then you accept that you were guilty. How can I be guilty for being born the way I was? My mother made me a homosexual! The wheels of politics grind very slowly. It will take a year or two, but we’ll get our apology. I look forward to my 100th birthday. And when that day arrives, this old queen will get a letter from the real queen. I was born a poor working-class boy. My father was a gardener for the local squire and my mother was the laundress.
world/europe,I didn’t do very well in school. I was virtually illiterate, but I was very good with my hands and became a patternmaker. When I was 15 or 16, I thought there was something wrong with me, that I was different from the others. But at that age you sublimate — you just don’t let it take control. You work hard, forget about it and find yourself a girlfriend. The word homosexual was not used at all. It was such an aberration, such a terrible thing. People automatically thought that you were a pedophile and that was very hurtful. So you did everything to hide it. The war was on, everywhere was getting bombed, and I wanted to join up. I was accepted by the Royal Air Force and at first I worked in a factory repairing airplanes. I wanted to be an aircrew member, but I was rejected. I became a physical training instructor, training the Battle of Britain pilots, and later joined one of the first convoys that sailed through the Suez Canal, while the fighting was going on. My character was formed in the Boy Scouts Association. I learned, “Never tell a lie,” always to be totally honest. But the pressure to marry, especially from my mother, became intense, and when I was 35, I decided to marry Vera, who accepted that I was gay.
world/europe,I did anything I could to make her happy and loved her, but I was still in love with the boyfriends I had on and off, and she put up with all of that. We had three children and once we had them, well, the sex part wasn’t that important anymore. We had a little family meeting, and I told my children, “Sorry, guys, your mummy and I are going to live apart because your daddy’s gay.” And my daughter said, “Oh, Daddy, we’ve known for years.” If you were gay and lived in a small, country village, the only way to meet other men was to go to the public gents’ toilet. People would write poems or their phone numbers on the wall. They wouldn’t do anything naughty; just use their eyes, and talk and meet people. The police used to get up into the loft and watch people below. The police would also pick up a young, vulnerable guy who had done something wrong and take him to the police station and bully and threaten them. He’d give all the names. That was called the queer list. My name was on the list so I was always very careful. But one day in 1974, I was in the stall when the police came pounding on the door. I was alone and doing nothing wrong but it didn’t matter.
world/europe,I was convicted of gross indecency by a local magistrate and forced to resign from the Scouts after 40 years of working with severely disabled boys. In those days, if you were gay, they assumed you were a pedophile, which of course wasn’t true. It was very unjust. About three years before my wife died, I met Somchai at a bar in London. I was in love with him the morning after I woke up next to him. My wife liked him, too, and one day she said, “I’ve had him all this time. You can have him now.” Somchai and I have been together for 21 years in complete harmony, and we shall be together until the day we die.
sports/football,Russell Wilson Has Seahawks Back in the Playoff Picture - The New York Times The Seattle Seahawks lost to the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 15, and fell to 4-5. The offense was struggling, and the star running back Marshawn Lynch was dealing with an abdominal injury. Lynch has not played since, and Seattle also lost tight end Jimmy Graham for the season. Yet the Seattle offense looks better than ever, thanks to the outstanding play of Russell Wilson. The Seahawks have won four consecutive games, with the bulk of the credit going to Wilson. He has completed 89 of 118 passes (75 percent) for 1,171 yards (9.9 yards per attempt), with an incredible 16 touchdowns and zero interceptions. He has taken just five sacks in this time after struggling in that department for most of his career. He has averaged 11.93 adjusted net yards per attempt over his last four games, the best stretch of his career. The graphic at right displays Wilson’s ANY/A average in each of his 69 regular and postseason games. The dot represents each game, and the line shows a rolling four-game average. During Wilson’s first three seasons, Seattle won 42 games (including playoffs), the most in the N.F.L. Wilson’s strong play was a big reason for the team’s success, but so was his minuscule contract, as he cost Seattle’s salary cap, on average, less than $700,000 during those years. In July he signed a four-year contract extension worth $87.6 million, including a $31 million signing bonus. With that extension, the Seahawks were banking on Wilson playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the league; over the last month, perhaps no player has been better.
sports/football,He is succeeding alongside players who, like Wilson, do not have the typical size for their positions. Eight of his last 16 touchdown passes have gone to the 5-foot-10 Doug Baldwin, an undrafted free agent in 2010 who has become Seattle’s de facto No. 1 receiver. Four more have gone to the rookie Tyler Lockett, who fell to the third round of the 2015 draft because of his size (5-10, 182 pounds). The other four touchdowns have gone to players, like Baldwin, who were undrafted: Jermaine Kearse (2), Fred Jackson (1) and Thomas Rawls (1), now on the injured reserve list. At 4-5, the Seahawks looked as if they would probably miss this year’s playoffs. Fortunately for Seattle, the team’s franchise quarterback — both in ability and contract — has played the best football of his career.
science/earth,A Struggle to Balance Wind Energy With Wildlife - The New York Times DENVER —  As the Obama administration seeks to clear a path for more renewable energy projects, it has increasingly found itself caught between two staunch allies: the wind energy industry and environmental organizations. Tensions between both groups and the administration have risen since a new federal rule was announced this month allowing wind farms to lawfully kill bald and golden eagles under 30-year permits. Conservation groups reacted with anger to the rule, saying it gives wind farms too much leeway to operate without sufficient environmental safeguards and does not consider the long-term impact on eagle populations. “A 30-year permit is like a blank check,” said David Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society, which was involved in months of negotiations on the rule. “It basically says you can go operate these wind turbines and kill as many eagles as happen to die.” Conservation groups said the United States Fish and Wildlife Service needlessly rejected an agreement, also endorsed by the wind industry, to develop more detailed regional plans that would set firm, research-based limits on how many eagles could be killed in a particular geographic area. “We put a historic deal on the table, and they didn’t have the vision to say yes,” Mr. Yarnold said. “Eagles are migratory birds,” he added. “Having a regional plan that reflects how they live and where they travel just makes sense.”
science/earth,Federal wildlife officials defended the rule, which will take effect early next year, saying it sought to balance the practical considerations of long-term wind farm projects with the need to keep eagle populations stable. While neither bald nor golden eagles are considered endangered — the bald eagle was removed from the endangered species list in 2007 — both birds are still afforded federal wildlife protections. It is illegal to kill or hunt them without a proper permit. Since 2009, wind farms have been able to apply for five-year permits, allowing them to “take” — meaning kill — a certain number of eagles, as long as the farms demonstrate that they have undertaken adequate measures to keep the birds safe. The new rule extends the maximum term of the permits to 30 years. It includes federal reviews every five years to assess whether sufficient measures are being taken to make sure eagles are being conserved. While it is unknown precisely how many birds are killed by wind turbines annually — usually by flying into a turbine’s path — estimates range from 10,000 to more than 500,000. According to the American Wind Energy Association, eagles account for only a tiny fraction of those deaths. The group said that less than 2 percent of the annual golden eagle deaths from human causes are because of wind turbines, and fewer than six bald eagles have ever been killed by a wind turbine.
science/earth,Last month, in the first case of its kind, Duke Energy agreed to pay $1 million in fines after a subsidiary pleaded guilty in federal court in Wyoming to violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The company was charged with killing dozens of birds since 2009, including 14 golden eagles, at two Wyoming wind farm projects. Daniel M. Ashe, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said that ensuring eagle populations are preserved is a central focus of the new rule. “The conservation element is key,” he said. “We’re not going to authorize a permit unless we believe it provides for the conservation of eagles.” Mr. Ashe added that the wildlife service would issue a permit only if a wind developer had minimized the risk to eagles through its choice of location and the design of the project, among other variables. Regional thresholds on how many eagles can realistically be killed are already in place, according to the service. Mr. Ashe said that many of the measures presented by environmentalists and the wind energy industry would likely be considered as the permitting process continued to be modified. For its part, the American Wind Energy Association has publicly endorsed the new permitting process, saying that the spirit of many points of common interest had been included, or would be addressed in the near future. The group said that it expected wind companies would seek the longer permits, because it made more sense than having to reapply every five years.
science/earth,“This is a conservation plan for eagles,” said John Anderson, director of siting policy for the association, “so all efforts must be first made to reduce the potential for impacts on eagles and then fully offset them.” “Wind developers are willing to go through all these requirements,” he added. “It is in the best interest of the species from a conservation standpoint, as well as their own from the standpoint of legal certainty.”
world/middleeast,From Playground to Killing Ground: An ISIS Legacy - The New York Times It was never just a traffic circle. Not before Syria fell into civil war and the Islamic State moved into Raqqa, when there was lush grass and a fountain at its center, and children splashed in the heat of the summer and visited the Cafe al-Naem ice cream shop. And not after, when it became a symbol of the battle for Raqqa, and, the militants decided, an ideal spot for public executions. The traffic circle is known as Naem — Arabic for “paradise.” When a summer heat wave hit Raqqa, nestled on the banks of the Euphrates River, children jumped into the fountain at the center of the Naem traffic circle to get some relief. The fountain, installed just three years earlier, had a colorful light display and a speaker that played music on holidays. At the time, several rebel groups, including a number of Islamist brigades, had already wrested the city from government control. But Raqqa was still largely intact and full of residents. The Islamic State, though, was quickly gaining power. By the fall of 2013, it controlled most of Raqqa. By early the next year, the group, also known as ISIS, had solidified its grasp on the city, and began imposing its strict form of Islam on all the residents. In the summer of 2014, the Islamic State went on an offensive, seizing territory across large parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq, and declaring its own caliphate. At the center of its newly formed pseudo-state was Raqqa, and at the center of that capital, the Naem roundabout.
world/middleeast,The militants paraded through the streets of Raqqa on June 30, 2014, centering their demonstrations on Naem Square. Footage posted by a local group of media activists showed the fighters waving flags and doing “doughnuts” with their tanks as they circled the streets. By then, the park at the center of the traffic circle had been enclosed by a fence. The fountain, no longer pumping water, was encircled by the black flags of the extremist group. Things were changing elsewhere in the city, too. Women were required to cover themselves head to toe in black abayas; cigarettes and alcohol were banned; and the militants targeted anyone who spoke out against their authority. By later that summer, the roundabout known as Paradise had become more like hell. The site became a regular location for public executions. Local media activists recorded images in July of the bodies of dozens of men, believed to have been members of the Syrian Army’s 17th Division, strewn along the square. Some of them had been decapitated, their severed heads placed on the fence. In November 2014, Islamic State fighters prompted a crowd of local residents, including dozens of children, to trample three Syrian soldiers to death. Then they tied their bodies to motorcycles and dragged them around the circle. The ice cream shop was still open — but it was now frequented by foreign fighters who had surged to the city to support the Islamic State’s cause, and their families.
world/middleeast,On Aug. 29, 2014, activists posted footage of local residents cleaning up debris from an airstrike around the traffic circle. The storefronts of the shops around the circle were all blown out, and the fence toppled. The airstrike represented the beginning of what would be years of intermittent strikes, part of halfhearted bids to retake the city. All the while, the Islamic State continued to crack down on residents, and its power grew and contracted in other portions of its far-flung territory. It was not until earlier this year that the American-led coalition of local forces, made up of Kurdish and Arab fighters, began an offensive to retake the city. Drone footage taken on Oct. 10 shows the ruins of once-bustling city streets stretching out from the square. They are empty. The bombed-out shells of buildings stand like ghosts around the traffic circle. As far as the eye can see, the scene is the same: crumbling dust-covered buildings. Nearly all of the city’s 300,000 original residents have been displaced. The militants made their last stand in the area around the city’s sprawling stadium, just blocks from the traffic circle. When American-backed coalition members claimed control of the city, their victory celebrations seemed oddly familiar: Their route was a mirror image of the one Islamic State fighters took when they paraded through the city in the summer of 2014. But little else seemed familiar, oddly or otherwise, at the Naem circle. The ice cream shop is gone. So are all the other stores that once surrounded the fountain. The buildings that housed them are crumbling from years of bombardment.
world/middleeast,This time around, the tanks carried not the black flag of ISIS but the yellow banners of the Syrian Democratic Forces. But they, too, were doing doughnuts.
sports/football,Bengals’ Andy Dalton May Return This Season - The New York Times
business,A Filipino Linked to 'Love Bug' Talks About His License to Hack - The New York Times Did Onel de Guzman create the ''Love Bug,'' the most destructive computer virus in history? ''I admit I create viruses, but I don't know if it's one of mine,'' he said in an interview here. ''If the source code was given to me, I could look at it and see. Maybe it is somebody else's, or maybe it was stolen from me.'' Mr. de Guzman, 24, understands that in the information age, fame is fleeting. With his notoriety vanishing like so many 1's and O's in cyberspace, this Filipino computer school dropout wants the world to know he is a brilliant hacker -- a mastermind who can turn a PC into putty. But Mr. de Guzman has a problem. His claim to fame is the suspicion that he created a computer bug that hopscotched around the world, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage as it paralyzed computers from the Pentagon to the British Parliament. In many countries, that would have landed him in prison. The Philippine authorities filed theft and other charges against Mr. de Guzman, but dropped them in August because of insufficient evidence. The case against him was weakened because at the time, the Philippines did not have laws governing computer espionage.
business,Now it does -- which means that if Mr. de Guzman confesses, he could wind up back in legal trouble. So this shy, spiky-haired young man is playing a risky game of wink and nod: giving occasional interviews in which he refuses to own up to the virus, but tries to cash in on the dark glory it confers. ''There are so many computer geniuses out there,'' said Mr. de Guzman, as his lawyer monitored his remarks. ''But I think I have become part of the history of the Philippines. That cannot be erased.'' Mr. de Guzman said he no longer hacked. But he still practices ''cracking,'' which he describes as gaining unauthorized access to passwords, serial numbers and other numeric codes. He said he used the technique to download unlicensed software from the Internet, rather than paying for it. ''Cracking does not destroy,'' he said. ''You know what effect you are going to have when you crack.'' Mr. de Guzman said he saw nothing wrong with purloining software, just as he has no moral qualms about the damage caused by viruses. He said software makers, notably Microsoft, were to blame for the Love Bug debacle because they licensed products vulnerable to sabotage. ''For programmers like us, it is not wrong,'' Mr. de Guzman said, speaking in Tagalog. ''I'm the user; I buy the product. If I use it in a wrong or improper way, why should I be blamed? I bought the product.''
business,People who follow the computer industry said such amoral attitudes were typical among computer hackers, whether they lived in the teeming neighborhoods of Manila or the low-rise sprawl of Silicon Valley. Indeed, until last spring, Mr. de Guzman was an unremarkable young man struggling to complete the requirements for a computer science degree at a technical college here. On May 4, an e-mail bearing the title ''I LOVE YOU'' began popping up in computers in Asia. When opened, it destroyed graphics and other files. The e-mail program, commonly called a virus or worm, spread by sending itself to all the other e-mail addresses in a computer's database. Within hours, it had followed the rising sun to newsrooms, brokerage firms and government offices in Europe and the United States. ''I was at home sleeping,'' Mr. de Guzman recalled. ''When I woke up, I heard it on the news. It didn't mean anything to me.'' Manila quickly became the focus of a feverish worldwide hunt for the author of the virus. The police identified Mr. de Guzman as their prime suspect after a local Internet service provider traced an unusually heavy volume of data traffic to a computer in the home of his sister. Mr. de Guzman at first said he might have released the virus by accident. Now, he says, he does not know how it got out. Mr. de Guzman said he became a suspect because of a thesis proposal he had submitted to his college. The proposal, which laid out a method for stealing passwords to gain free access to the Internet, was rejected. Mr. de Guzman said his professors were close-minded.
business,''They did not want to believe that I had created a program that exposed a hole in the operating system,'' he said. ''They couldn't accept that I was able to do that. I told them, but they didn't want to accept it.'' Did he unleash the virus to vindicate his thesis? ''I don't know if I was the one proving it,'' he said after a lengthy pause. ''I just showed them the thesis.'' Mr. de Guzman holed up at his mother's house for weeks after the police named him as a suspect. The few times he ventured out, he said he was pointed at by people. He has since cut his hair and gained weight, he says, from eating home-cooking and passing the time on a couch with a Sony Playstation. These days, Mr. de Guzman said he could go out with his friends in relative anonymity. But his return to obscurity has dampened his job prospects. At the height of the affair, Mr. de Guzman said he was bombarded by job offers from computer companies. He ignored them to focus on his legal defense. Now, the companies have stopped calling. Mr. de Guzman wants people to know he is in the job market. He said he would even consider Microsoft, whose Outlook software was one of the main transmission vehicles for the virus. ''If the offer is good, if they're not pressuring me, I think maybe I might accept,'' Mr. de Guzman said.
business,First, though, he has to stay out of trouble. Mr. de Guzman's lawyer, Rolando Quimbo, said that the Internet service provider that was used to launch the virus had petitioned to reinstate the case against him. While that seems unlikely, Mr. Quimbo wants his client to avoid incriminating statements. In June, prodded by the Love Bug case, the Philippine government passed a law that bans hacking. By then, however, it was too late to prosecute Mr. de Guzman under its provisions. The senator who pushed the bill, Ramon Magsaysay Jr., said it was aimed at future hackers. ''Once the law is implemented, and a couple of people are sent to jail, they may think twice,'' Mr. Magsaysay said. ''But young people being who they are, I'm sure some will still try to break into databases.'' For his part, Mr. de Guzman insisted the thrill of hacking was gone. If he cannot find work with a software company, he said he would go into business -- perhaps opening a cybercafe. Longer term, he said he would like to write a software program impervious to hackers. ''But if somebody hacked it, I would just laugh,'' Mr. de Guzman said without a trace of a smile. ''I would admire them.''
us,A World Away From Wall Street, a Bank and a Robber - The New York Times CARLETON, Neb. The man entered the intimate Citizens State Bank with a balaclava covering his face and sunglasses shading his eyes. His attire did not seem too out of place, given that workers at the nearby grain elevator are known to wear similar protection against the punishing cold of Nebraska in winter. Here in Carleton, the standard greeting — “Keeping out of trouble?” — gleans a “Yep” or a “Nope,” both equally reassuring to its population of about 136. But this man stepped up to the counter, with its rack of candy canes and clear view of the silvery vault open in trust, and greeted the teller with: Give me your money. The salutation received a classic Carleton response, something along the lines of: Are you serious? The man answered by making sure she saw the pocket of his heavy Carhartt coat, bulging with his hand and maybe something else. Following bank protocol, which says no amount of money is worth a human life, she gave him the cash in her till, all the while taking quiet note of two physical traits. He had fat fingers and a fat nose. He tucked the money into a zippered pouch and left without availing himself of either a candy cane or one of the complimentary yardsticks jutting from a bucket by the door. As soon as he left, the teller loudly called out words not common in Carleton: We’ve been robbed.
us,The bank’s president, Michael Van Cleef, came running out of his office, where he had been discussing a farmer’s financial situation with the bank’s loan officer. He looked out the window just in time to see the grimy getaway, in a maroon, dust-caked Grand Am with a spoiler on the back. The event took all of 55 seconds. Proper protocol continued. The bank locked down, and someone called 911. Within nine minutes the sheriff’s deputies arrived. Soon came the first of many calls of concern and support, a few of which, a smiling Mr. Van Cleef remembers, went like this: “Hear you’ve been robbed. Can I bring you over a pie?” In this day of bank bailouts and subprime mortgage debacles, some of us might find Robin Hood charm in a Nebraska bank robbery. Some might whisper the lines to the old Woody Guthrie song romanticizing the violent bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd: “Some will rob you with a six-gun, and some with a fountain pen.” But the Citizens State Bank in Carleton has no connection to any of those banking conglomerates with names like AmeriCitiComGroup. It is the only branch of a small, family-owned business that has six employees, three of whom are family and none of whom are accustomed to junkets. It has a few hundred customers and about $11 million in loans out.
us,Its one-story brick building, built as a bank more than 100 years ago, has remained a local fixture while most buildings in downtown Carleton, such as it is, are bricked up or closed up: the old Weddel’s grocery store; the old post office that partially caved in a few years ago; the old Little Café, where Thelma and Shirley sold fresh pies of apple and cherry. Just outside the bank, a Cargill grain operation grinds away. Truckloads of soybeans and corn are weighed and dumped with a sound like a sigh into the mammoth grain elevators looming over the empty storefronts. Every few minutes, another long Union Pacific freight train loudly announces itself. Inside the bank, Mr. Van Cleef, 46, is usually helping local farmers figure out how to finance the fertilizer, chemicals, machinery, fuel and irrigation needed to grow their crops, all while guessing what beans and corn will go for. There is no online banking here. It’s all face-to-face, how are you, Mike, see you later down at TJ’s for a burger. The Van Cleef business has not exactly followed the Wharton School model. Mr. Van Cleef’s father, Lloyd, 72, was a Navy veteran working as a meter reader for a gas company in Fairbury, about 40 miles away, when a local banker offered him a career change. He worked his way up the banking ranks and then, in 1975, decided to buy the Citizens State Bank in Carleton.
us,His teenage son, Michael, did not appreciate moving from a town with a Pizza Hut and a movie theater to a town where the passing trains served as entertainment. But he started working in the bank after high school, attended banking seminars instead of attending college, set aside aspirations of law school and eventually became a bank president without pinstripes. “You do loans, you do deposits,” he says. “You scrape the snow outside. You change the light bulbs.” Over the years, the bank, like Carleton, experienced some tough times. Lloyd briefly had to take a banking job in another state to help keep his own bank afloat. Michael’s wife, Nancy, held three jobs for a while: mother of five, bank officer and waitress at an American Legion hall in Hebron. The Van Cleefs recall a common-sense practice from those times, a practice that some larger institutions seem to have forgotten. “When things get tight,” Michael Van Cleef says, “you don’t get a bonus.” Maybe this explains why the bank and the Van Cleefs remain. Lloyd lives here with his wife, Marion, who comes once a week with mop and bucket to clean the bank. Nancy is an emergency medical technician. Michael is on the village board — overseeing a $100,000 budget and a single public employee — and was instrumental a few years ago in dissuading the Postal Service from shutting down the post office. ZIP code 68326 lives on.
us,This, then, is who a fat-fingered man robbed at 3:14 on the cold Thursday afternoon of Jan. 15. For the record, his was the fourth robbery at the bank since it opened in 1890, and the first in a half-century. Two were break-ins, and one, in 1950, involved a local man wearing a rubber mask and wielding a water pistol. He got away — briefly — with $12.50. The robber and his dirty Grand Am probably turned right onto D Street, past the crumbling old post office, the new post office in the old library, and TJ’s Café, where locals gather on Fridays for the Mexican night specials. A quick left, a quick right, across Route 4 and then onto a gravel road heading north, where the Van Cleefs say his dust trail was seen by more than a local herd of Holsteins before he vanished into the great American vastness. Through that afternoon and into the night, people in cars rolled slowly past the bank to catch a glimpse of investigators working behind the yellow caution tape, while calls of concern continued: from TJ’s, offering to send over some food; from banking competitors, offering to send over staff or money. Some said they had seen that Grand Am around. Michael Van Cleef says he feels violated — as though someone had broken into his home — but is glad no one got hurt. And while he would not reveal how much had been stolen, he says the amount was not worth the robber’s trouble.
us,He says he wonders what motivated the man with fat fingers. Did it have something to do with what investigators were saying? That with this economy, we’re going to see more robberies in rural America? No matter. On the morning after the robbery, at precisely 8:30, the Citizens State Bank once again opened its doors to the rumbles and sighs of Carleton.
world/asia,Nawaz Sharif Set to Regain Power in Pakistan - The New York Times LAHORE, Pakistan — Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, once a political exile deposed by the military, returned to the cusp of power on Saturday, taking a commanding lead in a parliamentary election in which Pakistanis braved Taliban intimidation to cast ballots with historic prospects for the country’s democracy. Record turnout was reported in several cities, incited by an energized political campaign dominated by the battle between Mr. Sharif and Imran Khan, the former cricket star whose appeal as an anticorruption crusader had many predicting he could play a kingmaker role. But even with just partial returns in early Sunday, Mr. Sharif’s party appeared to have secured enough seats to form a government easily. His supporters ran cheering through the streets of Lahore, honking horns and, in some instances, firing bursts of celebratory gunshots. While the raucous election highlighted the vibrancy of Pakistani politics, it also drew attention to the gaping holes in the country’s democracy. Threats by the Taliban to disrupt voting were borne out in attacks across the country that left at least 21 people dead, including at least 11 in a bombing in Karachi and others in Baluchistan Province, where turnout greatly suffered. Accusations of widespread vote irregularities in Karachi, the nation’s largest metropolis, led to the invalidation of results from dozens of polling places, officials said. Final results are likely to wait for days.
world/asia,Even if Mr. Sharif faces no obstacles in forming a government, he will have to deal with a stalled economy, profound infrastructure failure and grave threats from an emboldened Taliban insurgency. Furthermore, he has promised to rein in American influence in Pakistan, leaving questions about the countries’ often-stormy relationship. The election was Pakistan’s 10th since 1970 but the first in which a civilian government that has served a full five-year term is poised to peacefully hand power to another elected government. Unlike previous elections, in which the military’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was widely accused of vote manipulation and intimidation, this one offered little evidence of involvement by the military, which has ruled Pakistan directly for more than half its 66-year history. Instead, the country was gripped by election fever, most of it driven by the contest between Mr. Sharif and Mr. Khan. In the final days of campaigning, the momentum appeared to be with Mr. Khan, who electrified voters with a series of mass rallies that tapped into a deep vein of support among young and middle-class Pakistanis in urban areas. His ratings rose further after he fell nearly 15 feet to the ground at a rally in Lahore on Tuesday, badly injuring his back but winning widespread public sympathy. But as the results flooded in late Saturday, and television projections gave Mr. Sharif up to 119 of the 268 elected seats on offer, against just 33 for Mr. Khan, promises of a revolutionary “tsunami” led by the former cricket player appeared to have vanished.
world/asia,That result signaled a victory of sorts for old-style dynastic politics: the Sharifs have dominated Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, since the 1980s, and have cultivated voters for the past five years through development projects financed by the provincial government, which they controlled. The other loser was President Asif Ali Zardari’s Pakistan Peoples Party, which led the last government but now seems destined to the opposition benches. Mr. Khan, however, was poised to capture a valuable consolation prize, one with potentially sharp implications for American policy: control of the provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, along the Afghan border. During his campaign rallies, Mr. Khan stridently said he would end C.I.A. drone strikes in the tribal belt, by ordering the Pakistani military to shoot down American aircraft if necessary. And he has said he believes that the Pakistani state should negotiate with Taliban insurgents, not fight them. Still, it is Mr. Sharif who is likely to have the greatest impact on relations with the United States. A nationalist by inclination, Mr. Sharif, while publicly amenable to reaching out to the Americans, has also hinted that he was open to negotiating with Taliban rebels in the northwest — a stance that would greatly concern American officials as they try to withdraw from an Afghan war next door that has featured many cross-border attacks by those insurgents.
world/asia,A conservative and a steel baron, Mr. Sharif was mentored in his political career by a military dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, in the mid-1980s. But he turned against the generals after his ouster at the hands of Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 1999, which resulted in a long exile in Saudi Arabia. Since then, many military men have viewed Mr. Sharif with suspicion. He first came to American attention during Pakistan’s tense confrontation with India in 1999, when the possibility of a nuclear conflict was averted thanks to mediation by President Bill Clinton. The election evoked a rare sense of enthusiasm for politics in Pakistan. About 4,670 candidates fought for 272 directly elected seats in Parliament, while almost 11,000 people battled for the four provincial assemblies. Aside from more traditional politicians, they included astrologers, transgender candidates, former models and the first female candidates in the tribal belt along the Afghan border. Also running were dozens of candidates from Sunni sectarian groups, some with links to violent attacks on minority Shiites. Mr. Khan’s campaign, in particular, had a carnival atmosphere because it drew so many young urban residents into politics, many of them first-time voters. In the wealthier neighborhoods of Lahore on Saturday, supporters danced in the streets and waved giant flags bearing Mr. Khan’s image. But the sense of a vibrant, if flawed, democracy was tempered by Taliban attacks throughout the campaigning. The militant movement’s ability to derail campaigning, particularly in the mountainous northwest, was taken as a signal that it has evolved beyond its nihilistic guerrilla roots and has become a powerful political insurgency bent on upending Western-style democracy in Pakistan.
world/asia,Campaigning was further marred Thursday when Ali Haider Gilani, 27, the son of former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, was shot and kidnapped by unidentified gunmen as he addressed a campaign event in the city of Multan, in southern Punjab Province. Two guards who tried to protect Mr. Gilani were shot to death; the candidate was reportedly bleeding from a gunshot wound as he was dragged into a vehicle and driven away. In a statement on Friday, the Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud ordered his commanders to attack the “infidel system” of democracy, warning that teams of suicide bombers would hit targets across the country. At least 21 people were reported killed in attacks across Pakistan on Saturday, among them a gunfight and an attack on a polling place in the western province of Baluchistan and two explosions in the northwest, including in Peshawar, that injured several people. The deadly bombing in Karachi appeared to have been directed at a candidate from the Awami National Party, one of three secular-leaning parties that have borne the brunt of Taliban attacks that have killed at least 125 people in the last month. The police established new checkpoints, and military helicopters patrolled the skies in Peshawar, the city that has been worst hit by militant violence over the years. Hospital workers were put on alert while billboards across the city asked residents to watch for suspicious activity.
world/asia,After a slow start to voting, large numbers of voters emerged by midmorning, including many women. About 300 women in burqas stood in line outside the Lady Griffith High School, where policemen warned photographers not to take pictures of the women. One of the women, Saba Iqbal, 35, a doctor, said she was going to vote for Mr. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. “I never voted before,” she said, “but this time I want to be part of Imran Khan’s change.” Mr. Zardari’s Pakistan Peoples Party found itself badly overshadowed in the race after a lackluster and leaderless campaign. The party developed a poor reputation for governance as the economy faltered in recent years and ministers failed to reverse crippling power shortages. Among the party kingpins who lost their seats on Saturday was Raja Pervez Ashraf, the previous prime minister, who suffered a crushing loss to a candidate from Mr. Sharif’s party. There were also signs of irregularities like those that tainted some past votes. At least one party, Jamaat-e-Islami, withdrew its candidates from Karachi and Hyderabad, protesting that the election was being rigged at various polling places. Officials blamed the Muttahida Quami Movement party, which has traditionally dominated Karachi. A senior official with the Jamaat called for a peaceful strike on Monday to protest reported vote-rigging in the city. Prominent officials of both Mr. Zardari’s and Mr. Sharif’s parties lodged similar accusations, saying they would reject some results in Karachi.
world/asia,After polls closed, the Election Commission of Pakistan said that its staff had been threatened in the city, but that the voting had generally gone well. Early on Sunday, The New York Times bureau chief in Pakistan, Declan Walsh, left the country three days after receiving a notice from the Interior Ministry that his visa had been canceled. Mr. Walsh, who covered the elections on Saturday from Lahore, was accompanied to the airport by plainclothes intelligence agents, he said in a telephone interview. The men had closely paced him for hours. He received the notice early Thursday morning from police officers outside his home in Islamabad. The order read in full: “It is informed that your visa is hereby canceled in view of your undesirable activities. You are therefore advised to leave the country within 72 hours.” No further details of any wrongdoing were given, and Pakistani officials did not respond to repeated requests for more information. The Times’s executive editor, Jill Abramson, filed a formal complaint with the Pakistani government on Friday, seeking Mr. Walsh’s reinstatement and noting that his expulsion struck a troubling note for a country celebrating an important milestone as a democracy. “The expulsion of an established journalist, on the day of the voting, contradicts that impression,” she wrote.
well/live,Noise May Raise Blood Pressure Risk - The New York Times Airport noise could raise the risk for high blood pressure, a new study suggests. Greek researchers studied 420 people living near Athens International Airport, where an average of 600 airplanes take off and land every day. Maps made during construction of the airport divided the surrounding area by noise level: less than 50 decibels, 50 to 60 decibels (60 decibels is about the noise level of a room air-conditioner), and more than 60 decibels, so researchers could track noise exposure precisely. About two-thirds of the residents lived in the areas that regularly experienced noise at the 50- to 60-decibel level, and almost half of them had high blood pressure when the study began. Over the next 10 years, there were 71 newly diagnosed cases of hypertension. The study, in Occupational and Environmental Medicine, found that for each 10-decibel increase in noise at night, the risk of developing hypertension more than doubled. Cardiac arrhythmia was also associated with nighttime exposure. There was no significant link to stroke, diabetes or how annoyed someone felt about the noise. The researchers controlled for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, exercise and other factors that affect blood pressure. The lead author, Klea Katsouyanni, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Athens, said that this is one of the first studies showing that outdoor noise may be bad for cardiovascular health.
business/energy-environment,Study Links 6.5 Million Deaths Each Year to Air Pollution - The New York Times A sobering report released on Monday by the International Energy Agency says air pollution has become a major public health crisis leading to around 6.5 million deaths each year, with “many of its root causes and cures” found in the energy industry. The air pollution study is the first for the agency, an energy security group based in Paris, which is expanding its mission under its executive director, Fatih Birol. The agency, whose 29 members are wealthy, industrialized countries, was founded in response to the Arab oil embargo in 1973 to coordinate international responses to energy issues. It is perhaps best known for its monthly oil market reports that are eagerly awaited by traders. Mr. Birol, an economist, argues that pressing concerns about climate change and the emergence of countries like China and India as major energy consumers and polluters mean that the agency needs to shift its strategy. “To stay relevant,” he said in an interview on Friday, we “need to work much closer with new emerging energy economies.” Mr. Birol has been working to build bridges with China in particular, which energy experts say is crucial to the success of global efforts to reduce emissions. “To solve today’s biggest energy problems, the I.E.A. needs to have the world’s most important energy players as part of it,” said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.
business/energy-environment,Environmental issues, Mr. Birol said, are very important to emerging economies like India and China, whose cities are often plagued by choking smog. Helping these countries solve problems through increasing energy efficiency or filtering out pollutants can make progress on climate change goals. We need to make these countries “understand that their problems are our problems,” Mr. Birol said. Mr. Birol appears to be well-suited to this approach. Born in Turkey, he obtained his doctorate in energy economics in Vienna and began his career as an analyst at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil producers’ group, often seen as having an agenda rivaling the agency’s. Mr. Birol appears to be pushing to make the agency crucial in coordinating a global approach to energy-related efforts. This includes carrying out the global emissions reduction agreement reached in Paris last year. “The world needs a global energy body,” said Neil Hirst, a senior policy fellow at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College in London. Mr. Birol said that through relatively low-cost actions, like adopting more ambitious clean air standards and more effective policies for monitoring and enforcement, countries could make major strides in reducing pollution over the next quarter-century. China, for instance, needs to retire polluting coal-fired power plants and to establish stricter standards for motor vehicles. Such changes could produce big benefits. In India, the proportion of the population exposed to a high concentration of fine particles, a type of pollution, would fall to below 20 percent in 2040, from 60 percent today. In China, it would drop to below one quarter, from well over one half.
business,Georgia Passes Bill That Stings Delta Over N.R.A. Position - The New York Times ATLANTA — Georgia lawmakers approved a bill on Thursday that stripped out a tax break proposal highly coveted by Delta Air Lines — the most stinging punishment that America’s pro-gun forces have leveled so far on one of the many corporations recalibrating their positions on firearms after the Florida high school massacre. The $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that was sought by Delta, one of Georgia’s biggest employers, had been included in a broader tax-relief bill. But this week, a number of Georgia Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, sought to remove the perk as retribution for Delta’s decision to end a promotional discount for members of the National Rifle Association. Delta, in announcing the policy change, said it was trying to remain “neutral” in a national gun debate that has been rekindled by a gunman’s attack at a school in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. A number of other major American companies, including the car rental company Hertz and MetLife insurance, have also ended relationships with the N.R.A. since the shooting on Feb. 14. On Thursday, the Georgia Senate overwhelmingly approved a version of the bill without the jet-fuel tax break. The House, which had already approved a version of the bill, also approved the change. Both houses are controlled by Republicans.
business,The legislation now goes to the desk of the Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who has pledged to sign it into law. But Mr. Deal is a supporter of the jet-fuel tax break, and he said he would sign the bill only because it also included a significant reduction in personal and corporate tax rates. In a sign of the gulf that has opened between gun-rights purists and Republicans with a more pro-business bent, Mr. Deal this week appeared to chastise fellow Republicans who sought to punish Delta, and thus potentially harm Georgia’s business-friendly reputation. “Ours is a welcoming state — the epitome of ‘Southern Hospitality,’” said Mr. Deal, who will leave office because of term limits early next year. “We were not elected to give the late-night talk show hosts fodder for their monologues or to act with the type of immaturity that has caused so many in our society to have a cynical view of politics.” In addition to being one of Georgia’s biggest employers, Delta is the economic engine of Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the busiest airport in the world and a bragging point in the city’s claim to national and even international stature. The divisions over gun control are stark in Georgia, where Mr. Cagle is among a handful of Republicans who are seeking to be the next governor. They are particularly eager to make an impression among the hard-right conservatives who will have a big voice in the Republican primary in May.
business,Mr. Cagle, the presumptive front-runner in the governor’s race, presides over the State Senate, and his threat on Monday to kill the tax break was interpreted here as a way to protect his right flank from his Republican rivals. “I think that obviously Delta is free to make any decision that they want to,” Mr. Cagle said during an appearance on “Fox and Friends” this week. He added that Delta “chose to single out the N.R.A. and their membership, law-abiding gun owners, and I don’t think that’s right.” Delta announced on Saturday that it was ending a discount for N.R.A. members traveling to the association’s annual convention. Other Republican candidates for governor were also eager to weigh in in favor of rescinding the tax break. Secretary of State Brian Kemp said lawmakers should reject the perk to airlines and instead focus on creating a sales tax holiday for buyers of guns, ammunition, holsters and safes where guns can be stored. On the floor of the Senate on Thursday, Senator Michael Williams, another Republican candidate for governor, praised his fellow lawmakers for stripping the tax exemption, saying they “stood strong” in the face of pressure from liberals, the media and big business. Mr. Deal has said he was “committed to finding a pathway forward for the elimination of sales tax on jet fuel, which is nonnegotiable.” But the political reality seems to leave him with few options.
business,Democrats have argued that the attack on Delta, which did not comment Thursday, could harm the ability to attract new businesses, chief among them Amazon. The online retailer named metropolitan Atlanta as one possible location for its new headquarters. “Unfortunately, we’re looking at political gamesmanship, and trying to send ultraconservative messages for the Republican primary,” said Senator Steve Henson, the minority leader. “I think it does not enhance our chances to get Amazon.”
nyregion,Rezoning Plan to Remake 3 Upper West Side Schools Will Proceed, City Says - The New York Times New York City’s Education Department said on Wednesday that it would proceed with a fiercely contested plan to redraw elementary school zones on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in an effort to reduce overcrowding while increasing racial and economic integration at three schools. The plan, which the department was to present on Wednesday night to the elected parent body that votes on such zone changes, is similar to earlier versions of the proposal, which have drawn strident opposition and have prompted some parents to threaten legal action. In recent weeks, the department had stalled, stirring speculation that it might back down in the face of political pressure, as it did last year. Instead, the department said on Wednesday that it was forging ahead. In all, 11 school zones will be redrawn. The three schools that would be significantly affected by the move are at the southern end of Community School District 3, which encompasses the Upper West Side and part of Harlem. While the district is racially and economically diverse as a whole, many of its elementary schools are not. Two of the three schools, Public School 199, on West 70th Street, and Public School 452, on West 77th Street, serve students who are mostly white and well off. The zone for the third school, Public School 191, on West 61st Street, includes a public housing project as well as expensive apartments, though for decades white families have avoided it, leaving it with a population that is poor and mostly black and Hispanic. It also operates below capacity, while P.S. 199 is overcrowded.
nyregion,The department’s proposal would redistribute students and move two of the schools into different buildings. In an elaborate dance, P.S. 191 would shift to a newly constructed building just over a block away from its current home, which the department hopes will give the school a fresh start. P.S. 452, which presently shares a building with two other schools, would move into P.S. 191’s current building, where it could serve twice as many students as it now does. Some families currently zoned for P.S. 199 would instead be put into the P.S. 191 zone. And P.S. 452 would add some of the present zones for P.S. 191 and P.S. 199. Overall, the effect would be to put many more white, well-off students in the P.S. 191 zone, while putting more poor, minority students into the zones for P.S. 199 and P.S. 452. The changes would only affect future students; no current students would have to change schools, and children with older siblings already attending one of the affected schools would get priority at those schools. The plan is similar to one offered last month by the District 3 Community Education Council, the group that will vote on changing the lines. The department said the council would vote by the end of the month, when parents can start registering their children for kindergarten.
nyregion,The controversy over the zones is likely to continue beyond the council’s vote. Current P.S. 452 parents who oppose the school being moved have said they would sue to halt the plan. Residents of two buildings that would be rezoned from P.S. 199 to P.S. 191 — 165 and 185 West End Avenue — have hired a lawyer, though their plans are unclear. Assuming the rezoning survives any possible legal challenges, a major hurdle for the Education Department will be persuading wealthy parents to enroll their children at P.S. 191, which has low standardized test scores and was once labeled “persistently dangerous” by New York State. The department has said it would start a gifted and talented program for third graders at the school next year and would provide financing, starting this year, for an instructional coach to work with teachers on math and literacy. The department also said on Wednesday that it was moving to consolidate two schools in Harlem, essentially closing Public School 241, which last year had only 112 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. To do that, the department is asking the council to approve redrawing the zone lines of five other schools. Students and staff now at P.S. 241 would be moved to Public School 76, eight blocks north.
business,For the New Superrich, Life Is Much More Than a Beach  - The New York Times Jean Pigozzi, the venture capitalist and art collector, was lounging by the pool at his villa in Cap d’Antibes early this month, enjoying a rare break from what he calls “the circuit.” He attended the TED ideas conference in March in Vancouver, mingling with the likes of the tech investor Yuri Milner and Larry Page of Google at the “billionaires’ dinner.” Then he was off to the art auctions in New York and the Cannes Film Festival, where he threw a pool party attended by Woody Allen, Uma Thurman and the billionaire Paul Allen. In the next few weeks, after the Art Basel fair, he will be off to the Wimbledon tennis tournament and “the Mediterranean milk run” — the summer megayacht procession leading from St.-Tropez to Portofino and Capri. “We go all around the world to see some of the same people,” Mr. Pigozzi said. “It’s a circuit. There are a lot of parties, sure. But you’d be surprised at how much business gets done.” The new rich have developed their own annual migration pattern. While the wealthy of the past traveled mainly for leisure and climate — the ocean breezes of New England in the summer and the sunny golf greens of Palm Beach in winter — today’s rich crisscross the globe almost monthly in search of access, entertainment and intellectual status. Traveling in flocks of private G5 and Citation jets, they have created a new social calendar of economic conferences, entertainment events, exclusive parties and art auctions. And in the separate nation of the rich, citizens no longer speak in terms of countries. They simply say, “We’ll see you at Art Basel.”
business,An analysis using data from NetJets, the private-jet company, and studies from Wealth-X, the wealth research firm, offers a look at the annual flight path of this elite traveling circus. It starts in January in St. Bart’s, with the New Year’s Eve party thrown by the oil billionaire Roman Abramovich on his 70-acre estate, with top celebrities and business and media titans in attendance, and performances by bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After that, it’s on to the World Economic Forum in Davos, then the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, where this year politicians like Tony Blair and Wesley Clark, along with billionaire hedge fund and private equity chiefs like Ken Griffin and Leon Black, chatted about the global economy. The art auctions in New York in May kick off the spring. Then it’s back to Europe for the Cannes International Film Festival, the Monaco Grand Prix, Art Basel and the Royal Ascot horse race in Britain. In the summer, the wealthy disperse to the Hamptons, Nantucket, the South of France and other resorts. A conga line of megayachts rolls through the Mediterranean from France to Italy, including David Geffen’s 453-foot Rising Sun and the vodka magnate Yuri Shefler’s 436-foot Serene. In late August, the car-loving rich head to Pebble Beach for the Concours d’Elegance auto show and auctions, where last year a vintage Ferrari sold for $38 million. Then it’s back to New York for the Clinton Global Initiative for philanthropy mixed with hobnobbing, with swings back and forth across the Atlantic for the Frieze London art fair, the fall auctions in New York and Art Basel Miami Beach.
business,David Friedman, the president of Wealth-X, said that many of today’s rich were self-made entrepreneurs who prize business connections and making deals over spending time on the beach. Being able to say you chatted about self-driving cars over drinks in Sun Valley with Sergey Brin of Google conveys far more status than a winter tan from skiing in Gstaad. Just as they want a return on their investment and philanthropy, rich people now want a return on their leisure time. “When they travel or socialize, there has to be some redeeming business value,” Mr. Friedman said. “They want a transaction, even from their social calendar.” The calendar is a closed loop of access because the rich want to be seen, he said, but only by one another. With outrage over inequality driving more wealth underground, flashy spending and public hedonism have become less fashionable in very wealthy circles. Yet the competition for status among newly minted billionaires has never been stronger. “They can be a schizophrenic group,” Mr. Friedman said. “They want to be private and they don’t want to be public targets. But they want a community. These selective events over the course of the year give them that community of like-minded people, without having to deal with the public.”
business,Granted, some of the superrich attend only one or two events on the calendar. And the circuit has offshoots depending on interests. Art collectors will be heavy on the art fairs and auctions but may attend little else. The equestrian crowd flocks to the Kentucky Derby in the spring and the Keeneland yearling auction in September; media titans go to the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley in July, while fashion devotees go to Fashion Week in New York and the couture shows in Paris. The foodies head to the Aspen Food & Wine Classic in June and to Italy in white-truffle season. As Asia creates vast new wealth, events like the Hong Kong wine auctions and Art Stage Singapore will become bigger offshoots of the circuit. Yet for now, many of the superrich from China and other emerging markets are joining their fellow elites at events in Europe and the United States. Major entertainment and sporting events are crucial dates for the rich. NetJets says the Super Bowl was one of its biggest flight events in the last year; 250 of its jets descended on Phoenix for the game, and weeks later, 250 to 300 of them departed for the Masters Golf Tournament in Augusta, Ga. So many private jets arrived in Las Vegas last month for the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight that some were redirected to nearby airports.
business,NetJets’ other big events are the Cannes Film Festival, with over 200 flights, and Art Basel, with 200 to 250 flights. Each spring, more than 100 NetJets planes head to Warren Buffett’s annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting, known as the “Woodstock for Capitalists,” in Omaha. (NetJets is owned by Berkshire.) “It’s the ‘birds of a feather’ phenomenon,” said Patrick Gallagher, head of sales for NetJets. “These events give them a sense of security and of belonging. It’s people of similar tastes and similar interests.” In fact, so many rich people have been joining the circuit that Mr. Pigozzi said a new “supercircuit” is emerging, one that has V.I.P. events within the V.I.P. events. At the TED conference, the aptly named “billionaires’ dinner” held nearby has become the most sought-after ticket. And true media moguls now attend the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, a few weeks after the Cannes Film Festival. “Lions is now the important one,” he said. “Cannes has become too mainstream.”
sports/olympics,At Olympic Opening Ceremony, Britain Journeys Through Past - The New York Times They called it the “Isles of Wonder,” but it was really a parade of British whimsy: sheep and milkmaids, factory workers, the Internet, Mary Poppins, the queen and a snippet of the Sex Pistols’ rendition of “God Save the Queen,” and, oddest of all, doctors and nurses jitterbugging on hospital beds in a tribute to the National Health Service. The opening ceremony of the London Olympics on Friday was a tableau of national pride that studiously avoided bathos and easy excesses of patriotism. The show opened with music from “Chariots of Fire,” a movie about two principled British runners in the 1924 Olympics, but it was not the famous theme by Vangelis; the creators instead chose the classic hymn “Jerusalem.” The Vangelis song came later, as a joke by Rowan Atkinson in his Mr. Bean persona, comically bored and distracted while playing the synthesizer with the London Symphony Orchestra. In a video, even Queen Elizabeth II and her corgis did their bit, greeting Daniel Craig as James Bond in Buckingham Palace (“Good evening, Mr. Bond”). Then the queen, festive in a sparkling pink gown and pink-feathered headpiece, pretended, via a body double, to parachute into the Olympic arena at his side.
sports/olympics,It’s hard to imagine any other nation willing to make so much fun of itself on a global stage, in front of as many as a billion viewers. It takes nerve to look silly; the cheesy, kaleidoscopic history lesson that took Britain through its past, from pasture through the workhouses and smoke stacks of the Industrial Revolution to World War I and, of course, “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” was like a Bollywood version of a sixth-grade play. But bad taste is also a part of the British heritage. The imagery mixed the glory of a royal Jubilee with the grottiness of a Manchester pub-crawl. Britain offered a display of humor and humbleness that can only stem from a deep-rooted sense of superiority. People said Beijing’s opening ceremony was the hardest act to follow, but for Britain, it was the easiest. The Chinese government had so much to prove. The 2008 extravaganza, with all those waves of drill teams, dancers and drummers, thousands of anonymous performers synchronized to represent the invention of movable type printing, was a paean to regimentation, discipline and collective self-effacement that was magnificent, awe-inspiring and unenviable. (It didn’t help that the adorable little girl in a red party dress who sang an ode to the motherland later turned out to be lip-syncing with the voice of a child who sang better but wasn’t quite as perfect-looking.)
sports/olympics,Britain confidently opted for a celebration of individuality, idiosyncrasy and even lunacy. The showmanship was entrusted to the British filmmaker Danny Boyle (“Slumdog Millionaire”), and he favored pop music, movies, make-believe and Britain’s top export commodity: celebrities. David Beckham drove a bearer of the Olympic torch to the arena in a speedboat. Kenneth Branagh, dressed as the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, recited lines from “The Tempest,” and J. K. Rowling, the creator of “Harry Potter,” read from “Peter Pan.” Paul McCartney closed the evening with “Hey Jude.” NBC didn’t share the British art of playfulness. Even though the ceremony was shown with a time delay (no live streams allowed), the network prefaced the opening ceremony with its own opening, a solemn and pompous video celebration of the Olympics, narrated by the actors Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Ryan Seacrest came next, interviewing two members of the American gymnastics team. Later, Seacrest returned to ask the swimmer Michael Phelps whether he could emerge from these games as the greatest Olympian of all time. Phelps shook Seacrest off like a leg cramp. The NBC anchors Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira did their best to get in the spirit of British nuttiness, but at times their energy flagged, and their bewilderment became obvious. After a hospital sketch that morphed into a children’s nightmare — and a giant fake baby floating on a bed — Lauer said, “I don’t know whether that’s cute or creepy.”
sports/olympics,The whole show veered from cute to creepy and from familiar to baffling, including a pop music tribute to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. Most of all, it showed a love of movies that celebrate British eccentricity. “Isles of Wonder” seemed most inspired by a scene from the movie “Love Actually,” in which Hugh Grant, playing the prime minister, explains that Britain is still a great nation because it is “the country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham’s right foot.”
technology,It’s Discounted, but Is It a Deal? How List Prices Lost Their Meaning - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — As traditional retailing falters, shutting stores and shedding workers, online merchants are reaping the rewards. People like the convenience of e-commerce, and they love the feeling that they are getting a deal. The perception of a bargain is fostered by online retailers’ use of something variously labeled list price, suggested price, reference price or manufacturer’s suggested retail price. Whatever its name, the implication is that people are paying much more somewhere else. But with many products online, you could not pay the list price even if you wanted to. That is because hardly anyone is actually charging it. It is a sales tactic that is drawing legal scrutiny, as well as prompting questions about the integrity of e-commerce. If everyone is getting a deal, is anyone really getting a deal? Here is one recent example of how retailers use list prices to motivate online buyers: Le Creuset’s iron-handle skillet, 11 ¾ inches wide and cherry in color. Amazon said late last week that it would knock $60 off the $260 list price to sell the skillet for $200. Sounds like a bargain, the sort of deal that has helped propel Amazon to over $100 billion in annual revenue. Check around, though. The suggested price for the skillet at Williams-Sonoma.com is $285, but customers can buy it for $200. At AllModern.com, the list price is $250 but its sale price is $200. At CutleryandMore.com, the list price is $285 and the sale price is $200.
technology,An additional 15 or so online retailers — some hosted by Amazon, others on Google Shopping — charge $200. On Le Creuset’s own site, it sells the pan for $200. “Everyone expects a deal on the web,” said Larry Compeau, a professor at Clarkson University who is an expert on pricing strategies. “Nobody wants to pay retail. Some sellers are now willing to deceive consumers to make the sale.” The use of list prices online is at the heart of a case in a California Court of Appeal. Overstock.com, a popular online merchant, was found liable in a lower court for using misleading reference prices to exaggerate potential customer savings. It was fined $6.8 million, twice the size of the next-largest penalty for false advertising in California. In its appeal, Overstock said it followed “standard industry practices” to come up with its reference prices. Internet retailers including Wayfair, Walmart, Rakuten (formerly Buy.com), Crate & Barrel and Williams-Sonoma employ list prices to varying degrees. Amazon, the biggest e-commerce player, uses them extensively and prominently. If some Internet retailers have an expansive definition of list price, the Federal Trade Commission does not. “To the extent that list or suggested retail prices do not in fact correspond to prices at which a substantial number of sales of the article in question are made, the advertisement of a reduction may mislead the consumer,” the Code of Federal Regulations states. The F.T.C. declined to comment.
technology,“If you’re selling $15 pens for $7.50, but just about everybody else is also selling the pens for $7.50, then saying the list price is $15 is a lie,” said David C. Vladeck, the former director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “And if you’re doing this frequently, it’s a serious problem.” All of the retailers declined to be interviewed, as did Le Creuset. Amazon pointed to a disclosure on its website where it says the list price can have many origins: It can be the price on the product itself, it can be the price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or it can be Amazon’s guess as to what the list price should be. The retailer also said its list prices “may or may not” represent the prevailing price “in every area on any particular day.” “The list price has become a meaningless piece of information,” said Mr. Compeau, who was an expert witness for the California district attorneys who brought the case against Overstock. Meaningless, but useful. Even as the importance of a fixed list price has waned in the physical world, it has become more deeply embedded online. Retailers, as Amazon indicated, often are supplied with list prices by the manufacturer or the brand. “The manufacturer uses list price in an aspirational way — it’s what they wish they could charge,” said Victor Rosenman, the chief executive of Feedvisor, a start-up that helps e-commerce companies price competitively.
technology,“Then the retailer says to his customer, ‘The manufacturer recommended X, but I’m selling it at Y. It’s a better deal,’ ” Mr. Rosenman said. “As to how that price compares to anyone else, it’s your job as a consumer to figure out.” The Overstock case went to trial in late 2013. In one example cited by the district attorneys, a man bought a patio set from the retailer. It cost him $450, a discount of 55 percent from the list price of $999. The buyer was somewhat alarmed to find a Walmart price tag on his purchase for $247, a price he confirmed was the going retail price. Overstock said that was a simple error, but among the evidence presented during the trial were internal documents indicating that deals were not as good as they seemed. “Oh I think it’s been established that the ‘List Price’ is egregiously overstated,” one Overstock memo said. “This place has some balls.” In another email, Overstock asked a supplier to increase its list price, presumably so the Overstock price would appear even cheaper by contrast. An internal Overstock survey revealed during the trial found that its reference prices were on average 15 percent higher than the highest price that could be found online. Overstock maintained to the appeals court that “injury to consumers was minimal” and said the $6.8 million in penalties was “grossly disproportionate.” A spokesman declined to comment.
technology,In an earlier era, list prices were intended to prevent retailers from gouging customers — if $40 was printed on the box, a customer might flee if charged $60. Manufacturers also wanted to signal quality by discouraging deep discounting. They hoped retailers would stick to the printed price. List or reference prices are still used as selling tactics in the physical world, and companies routinely are sued for abusing them. J. C. Penney, for instance, set aside $50 million in November to settle a class-action suit in which it was accused of tricking customers into thinking they were getting big discounts. But online, list prices are even more important. “Offline retailers need blowout sales to draw traffic due to the costs of visiting a store — driving, then parking, walking and searching,” said Rafi Mohammed, a consultant and author of “The 1% Windfall: How Successful Companies Use Price to Profit and Grow.” “Online retailers don’t use blowout sales since it’s so easy to shop there. But to provide confidence to consumers that they are consistently getting good deals, it’s even more important for them to provide price comparisons.” After the Overstock suit, online pricing policies are coming under greater scrutiny. Two customers sued Amazon in late 2014, saying its list prices violated false advertising laws by bearing no relation to the prevailing market prices. The case was dismissed after Amazon pointed out that its customers gave up their right to sue in favor of binding arbitration.
technology,“This court may hope that Amazon would take every possible step to maximize consumers’ ability to make informed decisions,” United States District Judge Cynthia Bashant wrote in her decision. “The law of contracts, however, imposes less lofty expectations.” Last month, a proposed class-action suit was filed against Wayfair in California asserting that the retailer falsely advertised discounts for items that it had never sold at a higher price. “The referenced former retail prices were fabricated,” the plaintiffs claimed. Wayfair declined to comment. One manufacturer, Cuisinart, acknowledged that list price had little meaning. Consider the Mini-Prep Plus Processor, displayed on its website for $40. Amazon says the list price is $75, but in recent weeks was charging $40. That was also roughly what Belk, Bed Bath & Beyond and Kitchen & Company charged. Amazon listed dozens of third-party merchants offering the product, usually from $40 to $50. The Cuisinart Webstore, a separate entity from Cuisinart, sold it for $40. Mary Rodgers, a spokeswoman for Cuisinart, said the $75 list price was “the highest price you could actually see the product being sold for.” She said as far as she knew, no one was selling the processor for that price.
us,California’s Emissions Goal Is a ‘Milestone’ on Climate Efforts - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — California will extend its landmark climate change legislation to 2030, a move that climate specialists say solidifies the state’s role as a leader in the effort to curb heat-trapping emissions. Lawmakers have passed, and Gov. Jerry Brown has promised to sign, bills requiring the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels. Though the governor had already set a similar goal in an executive order, the legislation will lock the goals into law. The ambitious plan targets both power plants and vehicle emissions. “This is a real commitment backed up by real power,” Mr. Brown said, calling it a milestone in the state’s climate change efforts. He criticized the oil industry, which fought the legislation, as “Trump-inspired acolytes.” The effort to decarbonize our economy, in California and throughout the world, is extremely difficult, it’s a tall hill that we’re climbing. There is a struggle and there is opposition,” he said. “They have been vanquished, and vanquished in a very solid way. So bring it on; there will be more battles and more victories.” California passed similar legislation in 2006 and is on track to meet its goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Last year, the Legislature failed to pass a bill to cut petroleum use in half by 2030, after the oil industry waged an intensive campaign against it, relying on business-friendly Democrats in the State Assembly.
us,This year, the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved the emissions bill, which will prioritize reductions from refineries, along with another measure that will give lawmakers more oversight of the state’s Air Resources Board, which oversees the carrying out of the emissions standards. That bill is intended to send more money to poorer communities in the state that suffer some of the worst pollution. Several legislators from those areas have said that their districts have not benefited enough from money generated by the state’s cap-and-trade program. Senator Fran Pavley, a Los Angeles-area Democrat who wrote the 2006 legislation and one of the bills passed this week, said that much had changed in the past decade and that state lawmakers were no longer debating the potential effect of climate change. “People once thought we were being alarmist when we talked about drought and year-round wildfires,” she said. “But all these predictions have come true, and the realities of climate change seem to be accelerating and are tangibly visible sooner than I ever expected. The discussion here now is how to address it, not if.” The legislation does not address the struggling cap-and-trade program. The program is facing a lawsuit from the California Chamber of Commerce, which contends that the tax is unconstitutional. Mr. Brown has suggested that he would consider a ballot initiative to get voter approval of the program. It has brought in far less revenue than expected in the most recent auctions, which require companies to buy credits to release greenhouse gas emissions.
us,John Sterman, a professor and climate policy expert at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said California’s move sent an unambiguous message that major political forces support such action. “It says, We’re committed to this task,” he said. “We’re not going back.” In a practical sense, Dr. Sterman said, the decision gives companies and innovators clear direction about how to make investments. That could lead companies to drive down their prices in alternative energies, he said. Still, Dr. Sterman said, even California’s ambitious goals fall short of what will ultimately be needed to head off severe effects of climate change. “As welcome as California’s action is, it’s still not aggressive enough,” he said. The move solidifies California’s leadership in the United States, said Andrew Jones, a director of Climate Interactive, a nonprofit think tank. “They’re almost in a class by themselves,” he said, adding the effects were reflected in lower per-capita energy use by state residents. At the same time, he said, California’s efforts set a pace and tone for other states that will be reinforced by extending the law to 2030. “If we have backsliding in California,” he said, “it hurts other states.” Though federal emission reduction plans have stalled, several states are setting ambitious new targets. New York recently approved a 50 percent reduction goal for power plants. And Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said this week that he had drafted an executive order seeking a 35 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from the state’s power plants by 2030 compared with 2012 levels.
science,Auroras Give Earth That Colorful Glow - The New York Times Think of the night sky as the screen of a large computer or television set. Behind it, instead of an electron gun sweeping back and forth, lies the solar system's largest particle accelerator -- the Sun. Now at the peak of its 11-year cycle of storms, the Sun is firing streams of particles that are turning dark skies around the globe into shimmering palettes of color. Auroras form when the Sun, whether steady or tempestuous, sends flares and other ejections of solar matter into space. Such matter breaks up into streams of particles, mostly electrons. After speeding through space, the particles loop around Earth's magnetic fields and hit air molecules, causing them to glow. The aurora is a relatively stable feature at high latitudes. Viewed from space, it appears around both of Earth's magnetic poles as halos of fire. But now, the solar wind is unusually gusty. Auroras are being produced that are big enough and bright enough to extend down from northern latitudes into the lower regions where most people live -- and sky watchers can photograph the dancing lights. They last anywhere from a few hours to days.
world/middleeast,U.S. Is Appealing to Palestinians to Stall U.N. Vote - The New York Times WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has initiated a last-ditch diplomatic campaign to avert a confrontation this month over a plan by Palestinians to seek recognition as a state at the United Nations, but it may already be too late, according to senior American officials and foreign diplomats. The administration has circulated a proposal for renewed peace talks with the Israelis in the hopes of persuading the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to abandon the bid for recognition at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly beginning Sept. 20. The administration has made it clear to Mr. Abbas that it will veto any request presented to the United Nations Security Council to make a Palestinian state a new member outright. But the United States does not have enough support to block a vote by the General Assembly to elevate the status of the Palestinians’ nonvoting observer “entity” to that of a nonvoting observer state. The change would pave the way for the Palestinians to join dozens of United Nations bodies and conventions, and it could strengthen their ability to pursue cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court.
world/middleeast,Senior officials said the administration wanted to avoid not only a veto but also the more symbolic and potent General Assembly vote that would leave the United States and only a handful of other nations in the opposition. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic maneuverings, said they feared that in either case a wave of anger could sweep the Palestinian territories and the wider Arab world at a time when the region is already in tumult. President Obama would be put in the position of threatening to veto recognition of the aspirations of most Palestinians or risk alienating Israel and its political supporters in the United States. “If you put the alternative out there, then you’ve suddenly just changed the circumstances and changed the dynamic,” a senior administration official involved in the flurry of diplomacy said Thursday. “And that’s what we’re trying very much to do.” Efforts to head off the Palestinian diplomatic drive have percolated all summer but have taken on urgency as the vote looms in the coming weeks. “It’s not clear to me how it can be avoided at the moment,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a former Palestinian negotiator who is now executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine in Washington. “An American veto could inflame emotions and bring anti-American sentiment to the forefront across the region.”
world/middleeast,While some officials remain optimistic that a compromise can be found, the administration has simultaneously begun planning to limit the fallout of a statehood vote. A primary focus is to ensure the Israelis and Palestinians continue to cooperate on security matters in the West Bank and along Israel’s borders, administration officials said. “We’re still focused on Plan A,” another senior administration official said, referring to the diplomatic efforts by the administration’s new special envoy, David M. Hale, and the president’s Middle East adviser on the National Security Council, Dennis B. Ross. Mr. Hale replaced the more prominent George J. Mitchell Jr., who resigned in May after two years of frustrated efforts to make progress on a peace deal. The State Department late last month issued a formal diplomatic message to more than 70 countries urging them to oppose any unilateral moves by the Palestinians at the United Nations. The message, delivered by American ambassadors to their diplomatic counterparts in those countries, argued that a vote would destabilize the region and undermine peace efforts, though those are, at least for now, moribund. Two administration officials said that the intent of the message was to narrow the majority the Palestinians are expected to have in the General Assembly. They said that and the new peace proposal — to be issued in a statement by the Quartet, the diplomatic group focused on the Middle East comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations — could persuade potential supporters to step back from a vote on recognition, and thus force Mr. Abbas to have second thoughts.
world/middleeast,“The fact is there are countries who would choose not to do that vote if there was an alternative,” the first senior administration official said. In essence, the administration is trying to translate the broad principles Mr. Obama outlined in May into a concrete road map for talks that would succeed where past efforts have failed: satisfy Israel, give the Palestinians an alternative to going to the United Nations and win the endorsement of the Europeans. Diplomats are laboring to formulate language that would bridge stubborn differences over how to treat Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and over Israel’s demand for recognition of its status as a Jewish state. A statement by the Quartet would be more than a symbolic gesture. It would outline a series of meetings and actions to resume talks to create a Palestinian state. The Quartet’s members are divided over the proposal’s terms and continue to negotiate them among themselves, and with the Palestinians and Israelis. Among the issues still on the table are how explicitly to account for the growing settlements in the West Bank. The question of Israel’s status is also opposed by Russia and viewed warily by some European countries. The Palestinians have never acceded to a formal recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, in deference at least in part to the Palestinians who live in Israel. The Quartet’s envoy, Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, visited Jerusalem on Tuesday to negotiate the terms of the proposal with the Israelis. He is expected to discuss it with the Palestinians soon.
world/middleeast,The Israelis have so far responded positively to the draft, but the Palestinian position remains unclear. Two administration officials said that Mr. Abbas had recently indicated that he would forgo a United Nations vote in favor of real talks. But a senior Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, angrily dismissed the American proposal as inadequate and said a vote would go ahead regardless. “Whoever wrote this thought we are so weak that we cannot even wiggle or that we are stupid,” he said in a telephone interview from Ramallah in the West Bank. He added, “Whatever is to be offered, it is too late.” Within the administration, there are different views of the situation’s urgency. Some officials believe that the United States can weather a veto diplomatically, as it has before, and politically at home because of the strong support for Israel in Congress. But others view the Palestinian push for recognition as deeply alarming, raising the specter of new instability and violence in the West Bank and Gaza. “The most powerful argument is that this will provoke a Palestinian awakening, that there will be a new violence and that we’ll be blamed,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel.
business,F.D.A. Approves Prevnar 13 Vaccine for Child Infections - The New York Times The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Prevnar 13, an expanded version of a vaccine to protect children against more forms of bacterial infections that can cause meningitis, pneumonia and other diseases. Health officials say such infections cause a million deaths a year in developing countries and dozens of deaths in the United States, along with ear infections in millions of infants. Prevnar 13, from the drug giant Pfizer, adds protection against six types of bacteria to a current product, Prevnar 7, increasing its coverage to more than 90 percent of pneumococcal disease rather than the current product’s 80 percent coverage. Prevnar 7 had worldwide sales approaching $3 billion, making it one of the Pfizer’s best-selling drugs, and Credit Suisse analysts predict Prevnar 13 will exceed $5 billion in sales by 2014. Pfizer is counting on it to become the company’s top revenue generator after its flagship drug, the cholesterol fighter Lipitor, loses patent protection next year. In recent months Prevnar 13 has been approved in 38 other countries. While Prevnar 13, like Prevnar 7, is approved only for use in children, Pfizer is testing it on adults in two clinical trials that could lead to its use to vaccinate older people against bacterial infections, the company said. Pfizer may ask the F.D.A. to approve adult usage of Prevnar 13 by the end of the year, Geno Germano, president of Pfizer’s specialty care unit, said in an interview.
business,As with the older vaccine, Prevnar 13 is given by intramuscular injections at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and between 12 and 15 months of age. Pfizer said Prevnar 13 would be available within weeks to replace the older product. An immunization advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meeting in Atlanta on Wednesday, recommended that all children younger than 5 who received the Prevnar 7 vaccine get a supplemental dose of Prevnar 13 the next time they visited a doctor. Pfizer told the committee it would charge $108 a dose for the new product, 30 percent higher than the $83 a dose it charged for Prevnar 7. Vaccine products were the major attraction for Pfizer in its $68 billion purchase last year of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, which developed the Prevnar vaccines. Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker, is scrambling to diversify as patents of older products expire. Testing of Prevnar 13 in adults includes an 85,000-person trial in the Netherlands to protect against pneumonia acquired outside of hospital settings, one of the most common infectious illnesses, particularly among older people, Dr. Emilio Emini, Pfizer’s chief vaccine officer, said in an interview. Approval for adult use, said Mr. Germano of the specialty care unit, “would open up essentially hundreds of millions of additional patients who could benefit from the vaccine.” Pfizer has estimated it could add $1.5 billion in sales.
business,The new Prevnar vaccine protects against a virulent subtype of the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria called strain 19A, a growing threat to health that accounts for about 10 percent of the bacterial diseases. It became resistant to antibiotics about five years ago, Dr. Emini said, and is the major new strain attacked in the new product. A competing vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline, Synflorix, is approved in Europe and some other markets but not in the United States and does not include the strain 19A. Prevnar is the only such vaccine approved for infants in the United States. Merck and Lederle Laboratories make pneumococcal vaccines approved for some adults and children ages 2 and older but not for the younger group, which has the highest rates of the disease. The F.D.A. twice extended its review time for Prevnar 13, which Pfizer said was the most complex biological product ever submitted for regulatory review. An F.D.A. panel voted 10 to 1 in November to approve it, with one member expressing concern about safety, especially about adverse reactions like redness at the injection site and occasional fever. The illnesses caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria include meningitis, an inflammation of the brain covering; sepsis or bloodstream infection; pneumonia and ear infections. The bacteria have evolved, frustrating efforts to wipe them out. Pfizer plans to expand the childhood vaccine usage in other markets, including developing countries, through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, at a much lower price, Mr. Germano said.
business,The World Health Organization says at least a million children worldwide die each year of pneumococcal disease, most of them very young children in developing countries, making it the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death.
world/asia,With Plan to Join China-Led Bank, Britain Opens Door for Others - The New York Times BEIJING — A surprise decision this week by Britain to join China’s new development bank for Asia, despite opposition from the Obama administration, will almost certainly encourage other American allies to become members, particularly Australia and South Korea, analysts said Friday. Britain’s announcement Thursday that it intends to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China is largely funding in hopes of becoming the dominant influence in Asian affairs, has bolstered the fledgling bank’s reputation even before it begins operations, the analysts said. Britain said it wanted the new bank — which would provide financing for transportation, telecommunications and energy projects in developing countries across Asia — to address concerns about environmental standards and other lending safeguards before signing the final membership documents. But the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, made it clear Thursday that Britain was intent on joining, calling it “an unrivaled opportunity for the U.K. and Asia to invest and grow together.” Membership by Britain, America’s closest ally and the first would-be member from the Group of 7 leading economies, would be a major step toward China’s goal of making the bank, which President Xi Jinping inaugurated last October, a global financial institution rivaling the World Bank. The Chinese Finance Ministry warmly welcomed the British announcement, saying on its website on Friday that if all went well, Britain would formally become a “prospective founding member” of the bank by the end of March.
world/asia,Washington has expressed reservations about the new institution, on the grounds that it would not meet environmental standards, procurement requirements and other safeguards adopted by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank for their lending projects. But fundamentally, Washington views the Chinese venture as a deliberate challenge to those postwar institutions, which are led by the United States and, to a lesser extent, Japan, and the Obama administration has put pressure on allies not to participate. The National Security Council in Washington implicitly criticized Britain’s decision, in an indication that Prime Minister David Cameron’s conservative government had forged ahead with little if any consultation with the United States. “This is the U.K.’s sovereign decision,” a spokesman at the National Security Council said. “We hope and expect that the U.K. will use its voice to push for the adoption of high standards.” South Korea and Australia, both of which count China as their largest trading partner, have seriously considered membership but have held back, largely because of forceful warnings from Washington, including a specific appeal to Australia by President Obama. Peter Drysdale, a professor of economics at Australian National University who has advised Australian governments, said the British decision would probably lead Australia to join. “I think it will play into the decision by Australia which should be made over the next few weeks,” Mr. Drysdale said Friday. He added that Australia, with its close economic ties to China, had more reason to join the bank than Britain and other European countries had.
world/asia,Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s government decided against Australian membership late last year, citing national security considerations. In the weeks leading up to that decision, Mr. Obama spoke to Mr. Abbott and urged him against joining, a senior member of the Australian government said. Recently, however, the government has indicated that it is reconsidering. In South Korea, Britain’s announcement is likely to reignite the government’s internal debate about the merits of membership, said Hahm Chaibong, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “It will give a lot of ammunition to those who have been pushing for it,” Mr. Hahm said. “The ministries of trade and finance have been for it. The United States has been unremittingly negative.” Having South Korea as a founding member would be a considerable coup for Beijing. Mr. Xi has been wooing President Park Geun-hye, who must balance the security that the United States provides to South Korea against the relatively new economic clout of China. Mr. Drysdale said British membership would most likely amount to a persuasive case for major European countries to join. The head of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, Jörg Wuttke, agreed, saying, “If Britain walks through that door, others will follow swiftly. I am sure Luxembourg and the French are next.” A senior official at the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, which to the frustration of China has always been led by its rival Japan, said that American “intransigence” on the issue was futile. “This horse is out of the barn,” said the official, who did not want to be identified for fear of offending the bank’s member countries.
world/asia,“The United States can’t scold the Aussies and the Koreans anymore,” the official said. “The Australians want to be associated with this. They are practical people, why shouldn’t they be involved?”
world,As Russia Draws Closer to China, U.S. Faces a New Challenge - The New York Times
arts/design,A Bruegel, a Rembrandt, a van Gogh: Appraisal Puts Prices on the Priceless in Detroit - The New York Times The price tags are now on the paintings. Detroit’s emergency manager on Thursday released Christie’s long-awaited market appraisals for some of the greatest masterpieces in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts, which has become a political football in the city’s efforts to repay billions to creditors as part of a federal bankruptcy case. Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s “The Wedding Dance,” one of the institute’s calling cards and one of only five Bruegels in American museum collections, would bring $100 million to $200 million if sold, the auction house estimated. An 1887 van Gogh self-portrait — one in which he is wearing his familiar yellow straw hat and tortured mien — was valued at $80 million to $150 million. Rembrandt’s “The Visitation” would bring $50 million to $90 million. And Matisse’s “The Window,” the first painting by the artist to enter an American museum collection, would fetch $40 million to $80 million. A drawing by Michelangelo of a design for the Sistine Chapel ceiling brought the only sizable estimate for a work that was not a painting: $12 million to $20 million. While museums often have their collections valued in a blanket manner for insurance purposes, the public revelation of what its prized paintings and sculpture would bring on the market is a painful turn of events for the institute, which is facing a threat to its existence of a kind never confronted by another American museum of its size.
arts/design,Christie’s experts focused on a small number of masterpieces, the most valuable of which are on view in the museum’s galleries, and contained no big surprises: a handful of blockbuster old master and modern paintings account for most of the money that could be raised in a sale. The overall estimate — which Christie’s said would total between $454 million and $867 million — covers about 2,800 pieces, or less than 5 percent of the institute’s entire collection because Detroit’s emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, asked Christie’s to focus only on pieces that had been bought with city funds. The reasoning was that city-purchased pieces would be less subject to legal challenge if they were to be sold. Some of Detroit’s largest creditors have contended in court that the museum, which is wholly owned by the city, is not an essential municipal asset and that valuable works of art should be sold to help pay those who are owed. But the possibility of selling part of the city’s cultural heritage has enraged many, who say it would be a betrayal and would hurt the chances of a Detroit revival. The museum and its supporters have vowed to go to court to try to stop any sale. And the institute also recently entered into discussions with mediators in the bankruptcy case, including Gerald E. Rosen, a federal judge who has been conducting private talks with philanthropists trying to raise as much as $500 million to give to the city in exchange for an agreement to transfer the museum from city ownership. If the deal were accepted, the institute would become an independent nonprofit, as are many other museums around the country.
arts/design,Christie’s used what it called a “market data approach” to arrive at its price ranges — comparing works with similar ones that have been on the market. The estimates did not assume volume discounts or commissions, premiums or any other fees that might be attached to such sales. The ranges for some of the works reflect the fact that such paintings rarely come to market, and the prices could vary widely depending on which deep-pocketed collectors or countries decided to compete for such trophies. There are almost no firmly attributed works by Pieter Bruegel the Elder still known to be in private hands, for example. The sale of one from a public collection, said Johnny Van Haeften, an old master dealer in London, would be “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — actually in several lifetimes.” Mr. Van Haeften said he thought “The Wedding Dance” would probably sell for closer to $100 million, but added: “They’re as rare as hen’s teeth, and it’s entirely possible that a Chinese billionaire would come forward and say, ‘Well, this is the only chance anyone will ever have to get a Bruegel the Elder. I’ll pay what I need to.’ ”
us/politics,Trump Appears Set to Reverse Protections for Transgender Students - The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump appears on the verge of reversing protections put in place by the Obama administration to stop discrimination against transgender students in schools, officials said Tuesday. Civil rights advocates said that the possible rollback of protections, which could come as soon as Wednesday, would represent a major step backward after the enormous progress made by gay and transgender people in recent years. The administration signaled that an announcement was imminent on the question of whether transgender students should be able to use the bathroom of their choosing — and that Mr. Trump could well come down differently from his predecessor, President Barack Obama, a forceful advocate for transgender students. Mr. Trump believes that “this is a states’ rights issue and not one for the federal government,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Tuesday. Mr. Spicer said that officials at the Justice and Education Departments were reviewing a policy put out by the Obama administration last May that directed public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. The Obama administration said that transgender students fell under the sex discrimination measures in federal funding under Title IX. At the same time, the Trump administration expects to announce its legal position on a separate case before the Supreme Court brought by a transgender teenage boy in Virginia who was barred from using the boys’ bathroom at his school, Mr. Spicer said. The Obama administration had backed the boy’s position.
us/politics,Mr. Spicer’s assertion that the transgender question is “not one for the federal government” conflicts squarely with the view of Obama administration officials, who saw gay and transgender issues as perhaps the biggest civil rights fight of the modern era. Vanita Gupta, who led the civil rights division at the Justice Department at the end of the Obama administration, said that the indication that Mr. Trump’s administration might back away from transgender protections was troubling. “To cloak this in federalism ignores the vital and historic role that federal law plays in ensuring that all children (including L.G.B.T. students) are able to attend school free from discrimination,” she said in an email. Transgender advocates said that they worried that undoing the protections put in place by the Obama administration would open the door to further discrimination against transgender students — a group that is already the frequent target of harassment and hate crimes — and would create widespread confusion in public schools about what is allowed under federal policies. Mara Keisling, who leads the National Center for Transgender Equality, called the prospect of a retrenchment “outrageous,” and Rob Flaherty, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, called it “a hugely consequential decision.” Mr. Trump gave conflicting signals during the presidential campaign about where he stood on the transgender question. He said last April, for instance, that he supported the rights of transgender people to “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate,” and he said that Caitlyn Jenner, perhaps the most famous transgender person in the country, could use whichever bathroom at Trump Tower she wanted.
us/politics,But when the Obama administration put in place its anti-discrimination policy on transgender students weeks later, Mr. Trump indicated that he thought it had overreached and that the matter was better left to the states than the federal government. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is widely seen as hostile to gay and transgender rights, and his record on civil rights issues in general came under sharp attack from Democrats during his bruising confirmation fight this month. Mr. Sessions, pressed at his confirmation hearing about his past votes in the Senate against measures on gay rights protection, pledged that “I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by our L.G.B.T. community. I will ensure that the statutes protecting their civil rights and their safety are fully enforced.” The Justice Department declined to comment on the issue Tuesday. The department is eager to move quickly in laying out its legal position on transgender policy to avoid confusion in cases now moving through the courts, according to an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. One filing deadline is coming up this Thursday in the case now before the Supreme Court involving the Virginia transgender boy, Gavin Grimm. He sued the Gloucester County School Board two years ago after the board refused to allow him to use the boys’ bathroom and told him he could use a separate bathroom in a converted janitors closet. The Obama administration had rejected that type of accommodation as unacceptable and discriminatory.
us/politics,The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in the boy’s favor in August. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case next month, but Mr. Spicer’s comments at the White House on Tuesday indicated that the federal government would withdraw its support for the boy by the time the Supreme Court considered the case. In a separate case in Texas, the Justice Department said earlier this month that it was dropping its challenge to a nationwide injunction imposed by a judge that blocked the Obama administration’s guidance to schools last year on allowing transgender students to choose their bathrooms. The procedural move in the Texas case indicated at least a partial retreat on the issue, but civil rights advocates say they believe that the Trump administration plans to backpedal much more severely by dropping Mr. Obama’s transgender policy for schools entirely. James Essecks, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who is representing Gavin, said that while he was hopeful that the Supreme Court would detail clear legal protections for transgender students, the apparent retreat by the new administration was troubling nonetheless. “It’s astounding to me that this administration would decide that it’s going to stop standing up for young children in crisis,” he said. “That’s a bad development any way you look at it.”
sports,Checking In on ESPN’s Big Bet on Boxing. (Yes, Boxing.) - The New York Times One is a listing national sports network desperate for cheap and compelling programming that can help stem a decline in audience and balance out some $24 billion in long-term rights contracts. The other is a formerly glamorous sport hoping to regain relevance and attract a generation of fans who have never heard of Sugar Ray Leonard or Roberto Duran. In 2017, that makes them the perfect couple. ESPN is four months into a four-year deal with the boxing promotion company Top Rank, which handles some of the sport’s top names — Manny Pacquiao, Terence Crawford and Vasyl Lomachenko, among others. The nature of the partnership began taking shape on Dec. 9, when Lomachenko, a heralded up-and-comer, defeated Guillermo Rigondeaux before a capacity crowd at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. ESPN and Top Rank declined to discuss the terms of the deal, but the amount the network will pay over four years is estimated to be less than the cost of a single “Monday Night Football” game. The Top Rank deal will bring 18 fights to ESPN’s networks next year, two on ABC (Disney owns both ESPN and ABC) and several more on ESPN Plus, the streaming service ESPN will start in 2018. The deal will aim to alter the economics and visibility of boxing, while giving ESPN dozens of hours of relatively cheap programming. “It is really repositioning the sport,” said Todd duBoef, the president of Top Rank. “I think it has been siloed.”
sports,Nearly two million people watched the Lomachenko-Rigondeaux fight on ESPN. The undercard featured victories from Olympic medalists and the rising fighters Shakur Stevenson and Michael Conlan. The telecast followed ESPN’s coverage of the Heisman Trophy ceremony, to draft off its audience. To garner a following, ESPN needs fights like these in the worst way. ESPN receives $7.54 per month from every pay television subscriber whose system carries the network, according to SNL Kagan, which does media research. That fee accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue. But ESPN’s subscriber base has declined to 87 million households from 100 million in 2012, as people increasingly decide to live without pay television. While the network remains profitable, overall revenue has declined, squeezing profit margins. Also, ESPN’s audience is tiny for virtually everything except live major sports, dragging down Disney’s stock price. Locked into the enormous fixed costs of long-term rights contracts, ESPN has undergone two rounds of layoffs this year, shedding about 250 employees, though Disney’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, still believes in the self-proclaimed worldwide leader in sports. “We’ve never lost our bullishness about ESPN,” Iger said on a recent investor call. “The brand is strong; the quality of their programming is strong.” While the agreement with Top Rank is minuscule compared with other broadcast rights deals, so far it has provided ESPN with good value. Last year, for instance, including the playoffs and finals, ESPN paid the N.B.A. roughly $3.40 for each person who watched one of its N.B.A. telecasts. For the Lomachenko-Rigondeaux fight, ESPN paid Top Rank slightly more than a dollar per viewer.
sports,About 100,000 more people watched the Top Rank card than saw the Golden State Warriors defeat the Detroit Pistons on ESPN the night before. Of course, betting on boxing in 2017 seems like a fool’s errand. The only fighter most casual sports fans are familiar with just retired. (Hint: His name rhymes with Hayfeather.) The year’s biggest and highest-grossing fight was a farce, featuring a mixed martial arts celebrity who hadn’t boxed in a decade. And yet, like the infamous de-limbed knight from Monty Python, boxing’s boosters say the sport’s declines are mere flesh wounds. For three decades the best boxing has been difficult and expensive to watch, with any remotely intriguing fights on either pay-per-view outlets or the premium-fee cable networks HBO and Showtime. With only the worst version of the product shown on widely available channels, how could anybody become enough of a boxing fan to know it was worth paying for in the first place? Boxing’s other big problem, according to duBoef, is the disconnect between ability and wealth. “Greatness doesn’t equal money,” he said. “Popularity equals money.” A quarterback who throws six touchdowns a game, even if he has the personality of a brick, will earn a contract worth tens of millions of dollars because wins are worth lots of money in the N.F.L. But a wonderfully talented boxer who can’t connect with fans because of his style, his personality or both — say, Guillermo Rigondeaux — won’t earn anything near that.
sports,Both ESPN and boxing leaders talk of boxing as a series of peaks and valleys, a sport driven by the big event. Boxing can go weeks or months without being noticed by the casual sports fan. “If we’re really invested in the sport and we believe in the long-term prospects in terms of it coming back to a really significant prominence, it can’t just pop when there is a card on TV,” said Burke Magnus, the ESPN executive who negotiated the deal with Top Rank. ESPN and Top Rank are pulling levers to make the fights succeed. When Baker Mayfield’s Heisman Trophy acceptance speech went long, ESPN delayed the start of the first fight scheduled for its telecast. Four minutes after Mayfield finished, Stevenson and Oscar Mendoza were fighting, to keep as much of the Heisman audiences as possible. ESPN usually falls prey to its partners at the major sports leagues that set the scheduling. The boxing deal is an opportunity to dictate scheduling. Top Rank doesn’t particularly care on which Saturday nights its bouts take place. It happily created a card for after the Heisman ceremony, and future cards are built around the Super Bowl and the N.B.A. All-Star Game. It will take more than a few high-profile fights to transform boxing. There is still the confusing alphabet soup of sanctioning organizations, and too often fights are marred by baffling judging. But what ESPN and Top Rank can do is smooth out boxing’s valleys by obtaining something that has so far eluded the sport: advertising dollars.
sports,When boxers fight on pay TV and pay-per-view, they are on platforms that aren’t supported by ad dollars. If advertisers place money behind the sport of boxing more generally, perhaps the profiles of all fighters will rise. Rather than having ESPN sell 30-second commercials and having Top Rank sell sponsorship of the ring stanchions and venue signs, the two will be engaged in a “collaborative process” to sell everything possible. The entertainment and sports agency CAA, which also brokered the deal and represents most of ESPN’s top boxing commentators, will lead the sales process. Potentially more transformative to the sport than showing the fights is everything else the agreement contains. While little of it has been finalized, ESPN and Top Rank will develop some combination of pre- and postfight shows. There will be “College GameDay”-like boxing shows, and original boxing programming. Boxers “are very motivated to let cameras into their lives, to let people get invested in them,” ESPN’s Magnus said. ESPN’s coverage of an individual sport often correlates with the amount of that sport’s rights that it owns. Ask any hockey fan about the difference in ESPN’s coverage of the sport before and after it stopped broadcasting the N.H.L. in 2005. By signing with ESPN, Top Rank is expecting that boxing — mostly its boxing — will magically appear throughout the vast ESPN universe. “I believe in getting into the lexicon, Mike Greenberg, on ‘First Take,’ the scroll at the bottom,” duBoef said.
sports,On Dec. 9, ESPN’s president, John Skipper, made his way from the Heisman Trophy ceremony to the Garden in time for the Lomachenko-Rigondeaux main event. James L. Dolan, owner of the Knicks and the Rangers, and Steve Tisch, owner of the Giants, sat nearby. Skipper’s network indirectly pays both men tens of millions of dollars annually. But on this night, Skipper wasn’t sitting with Dolan and Tisch. He was front and center, with duBoef and Bob Arum, the legendary boxing promoter who founded Top Rank. For one night at least, they were the most important ESPN partners in the room.
us,In an Age-Old Quest for Balance, an Uncertain Shift - The New York Times MAUNALOA, Hawaii Scattered along the western stretch of the island of Molokai are the deserted structures of a vanquished people. This building with the title-free marquee was once a movie theater. That building, a luxurious lodge with a cow-ranch motif; notice the stop signs that say “Whoa” to nobody. Farther on, past the swimming pool now filled with sand, are the skeletal frames of what were known as tentalows. People once came from far away, paying handsomely too, for the chance to sleep behind canvas drapes, the Pacific within sight, the night stars almost within reach. These structures stand as eerie remnants of a years-long battle waged over the future of this island, an oasis of 7,500 with no traffic lights and no buildings taller than a coconut tree; with the state’s highest unemployment and highest percentage of Native Hawaiians; with a sweet way of saying you are welcome to visit as long as you understand its ways. On one side of the fight were the off-island owners of Molokai Ranch, a sprawl of property covering a third of Molokai’s 260 square miles. They worked for years with some community members on a broad development proposal that included lots of jobs, the reopening of a closed hotel, the unheard-of donation of 26,000 acres for conservation. And this: The building of 200 luxury homes along a gorgeous oceanfront spot called La’au Point. The development, the owners said, was necessary to help pay for parts of the tantalizing plan.
us,A 2006 marketing report described how “an unspoiled oceanfront” would attract people of means: “For the ocean-view lots, this would generally require a net worth of at least $1 million, and for the oceanfront properties the market for real estate at La’au Point comes from the premium pentamillionaire ($5 million) market and above.” Opposing the plan was a majority of the Molokai community, including many who took pride in the island’s long resistance to anything that might somehow make it less Hawaiian. The La’au Point proposal gave breath to their rallying cry of “Keep Molokai Molokai.” The property is sacred, they said, its crabs and limpets vital to their subsistence. It should be shared by the people who live on Molokai, not owned by people who do not. “We’re just caretakers,” said Walter Ritte, 64, a veteran warrior against anything he thinks might despoil Molokai. “That comes from our culture. The resources come first, and man comes second.” So began the Battle of Molokai Ranch. At stake: “pono” — the Hawaiian concept for what is honorable, righteous, in balance. The matter of balance has loomed over Molokai Ranch ever since some businessmen bought the property more than a century ago. Over the years, local people needed the jobs created by the various uses of the property — to raise livestock, grow crops, even serve as a wildlife park — but they also resented the dominance of the ranch over land and culture.
us,Owners came and went, parcels were bought and sold, development battles were won and lost. In the 1970s, protesters managed to thwart a plan to develop ranch land into a Honolulu suburb, with airport. But in the 1990s they failed to block the ranch’s razing of historic homes in this old pineapple plantation town of Maunaloa, as well as the rising of the Molokai Ranch Lodge, a 22-room luxury hotel featuring the island’s only elevator. The ranch’s current owners, Molokai Properties, a subsidiary of GuocoLeisure Ltd. of Singapore, set out to improve its image. When dozens of jobs were lost in 2001 with the closing of the Kaluakoi Hotel, a few miles away, they bought the property, reopened the adjacent golf course and intimated that they would someday do the same with the hotel. They also invited the community to help shape a development plan for the ranch property, which was hemorrhaging millions of dollars a year. Ultimately, the “Community Based Master Land Use Plan,” with its sly appropriation of “community,” was developed, earning the endorsement of several elected officials, including Hawaii’s governor, Linda Lingle. Thousands of acres of land to be donated. The resurrection of the Kaluakoi Hotel. The continuing operation of the Molokai Ranch Lodge, the golf course and other businesses. And that 200-lot luxury subdivision on 500 acres down at La’au Point. “It wasn’t going to be perfect; we all knew that,” said John Sabas, 61, who grew up on Molokai and worked for a while as the ranch’s communications manager. “But it would set us on a path of providing a sustainable future for the island.”
us,Others, though, chose the more familiar path of resistance. Some distrusted yet more outsiders promising a better future. Others feared disturbance of the holy compact between the land and its people. Asserting their own claim to the word “community,” they supplemented the local flora with colorful signs saying “Save La’au” and “La’au Sacred.” They staged an occupation at La’au Point. In dozens of meetings and hearings they challenged every aspect of the plan, every comma — especially its proposed use of the island’s precious water supply. Many feared that a subdivision at La’au Point would change more than the shoreline. “If you have a lot of wealthy people moving in, who don’t fathom life without a Starbucks, that starts to change the culture,” explained Karen Holt, 56, an opposition leader and director of the Molokai Community Service Center. “Don’t just come and make it a pentamillionaire’s estate.” In late March, the battle abruptly ended. Molokai Ranch, which was losing an estimated $300,000 a month, announced that it was shutting everything down: the hotel, the tentalows, the movie theater, the golf course, the development plans. More than 100 jobs lost, just like that. In explaining the decision to “mothball” the ranch, its chief executive, Peter Nicholas, said, “Unacceptable delays caused by continued opposition to every aspect of the master plan means we are unable to fund continued normal company operations.”
us,Today, nearly nine months later, the Kaluakoi Hotel remains deserted, the ocean view from its Ohia Lodge enjoyed by no one. A few miles away, glorious spider webs stretch undisturbed on the grounds of the closed Molokai Ranch Lodge. The quiet in western Molokai seems both natural and unnatural. The ranch’s owners, who apparently anticipated the current economic free fall, have not revealed their plans for the third of Molokai they own. “At this time we simply are putting the past behind us and are moving forward,” a spokesman said by e-mail, though he did not say what “moving forward” means. Here on the island, words said in the past still sting for some, but are forgiven or forgotten by others. Mr. Ritte and Mr. Sabas, who as younger men fought together against other development plans for Molokai, spoke to each other the other day. Each still maintains that his was the just cause. Some, including Mr. Ritte and Ms. Holt, harbor dreams of buying Molokai Ranch and restoring much of the land as a low dryland forest, which they say would replenish the water supply and ultimately make Molokai more self-sufficient. A wind-farm company has already promised to chip in $50 million, though several times that would be needed. But no one knows whether the ranch would even sell to its adversaries. And beyond matters of fair market value, there is another challenge: achieving this elusive thing called pono.
world/asia,Train Hits Hindu Pilgrims in Eastern India, Killing Dozens - The New York Times NEW DELHI —  An express train plowed into a crowd of Hindu pilgrims who were crossing the tracks at a remote station in eastern India on Monday, killing dozens of people and leaving a scene of carnage. An enraged crowd dragged out the driver and began beating him, and set parts of the train on fire, sending up a pillar of thick black smoke that could be seen miles away. The crowd remained so furious that hours passed before firefighters and rescue workers were able to approach the site of the accident, officials said. A train sent to help the wounded was forced to halt on the tracks a mile away. The disaster stood out even in a season of terrible accidents. The station in Bihar State was a remote one — inaccessible by road — and the Rajya Rani Express typically barrels through without stopping at a speed of around 50 miles an hour. Railway officials said the driver had been given clearance to pass through. But Monday was the last day of a holy month in India, and hundreds of people were disembarking from two stopped passenger trains while on their way to a temple a half-mile away to offer holy water to Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction. A top official at the railway ministry, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, said the driver had pulled the emergency brake when he saw people on the tracks but was unable to stop the train.
world/asia,“It was all quite frightening,” said Rohit Kumar, a passenger, who jumped off the train and ran for a quarter-mile to the nearest station when the crowd began to attack. “I’m standing here and watching smoke billowing out from the train. It was nightmarish. So scary.” S. K. Singh, the deputy magistrate of the Saharsa District, said 37 people were confirmed dead, including several children. India’s railway minister, Mallikarjun Kharge, said 28 had died, and noted that the pilgrims were crossing the tracks illegally. Parliamentary discussion on Monday afternoon deteriorated into a shouting match over whether the government bore responsibility. The chief minister of Bihar State called it “the rarest of rare tragedies.” He pledged 200,000 rupees, or around $3,180, to the victims’ families, and urged the railway ministry to do the same. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh released a statement calling for “calm in the area so that the relief and rescue operations can be carried out without any hindrance.” The station, Dhamara Ghat, was inaccessible by car because of the current flood season, so rescue workers had to walk more than two miles from the nearest road to reach the injured, a regional police spokesman said. A series of disasters have befallen pilgrims in India this year. In June, thousands drowned when flash floods struck the northern state of Uttarakhand, and the Indian authorities evacuated more than 100,000 people. In February, dozens were killed in a train-station stampede at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu religious festival on the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers.
world/asia,Young Symbol of Afghan Resilience Joins List of Lost Leaders - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — Abdul Ali Shamsi had already covered a lot of ground before he moved to Kandahar Province to become deputy governor a year and a half ago. Mr. Shamsi was at the vanguard of a new generation of Afghan leaders. From an early job as a security guard in Kabul, he became a security expert in Helmand Province and moved up in the provincial government there. And he helped found the Afghanistan 1400 youth political movement, starting public campaigns to console victims of violence around the country and to raise support for Afghan governance. “These efforts have two impacts: One is we stand up against things we believe are wrong, but the other more important factor is we project courage,” he told The Guardian newspaper a few years ago, as he was spearheading an effort to clean up and reopen a lakeside picnic spot in Kabul after a Taliban attack. “We enable people to stand up against violence, people who in many ways have been passive because of fears instilled among the population.” On Tuesday, Mr. Shamsi, 38, became a victim of the kind of violence he had helped others withstand, killed along with 10 other people when explosives placed within the Kandahar governor’s guesthouse detonated during a reception for visiting Arab officials.
world/asia,He was the third Kandahar deputy governor to be killed in the line of duty in just a few years, and he knew, in taking the job, that he would be just as much a target as his two predecessors — one a young poet and writer who was gunned down in a university classroom and, before that, an engineer who was killed by a suicide bomber on his way to work. The attack in Kandahar this week seemed expressly aimed at breaking down the cause that Mr. Shamsi and his colleagues were dedicated to: trying to restore faith in government after years of devastating war and disappointing failures. Among the dead were an Afghan senator and a member of Parliament, five officials from the United Arab Emirates and an Afghan envoy to the United States, according to officials. Eighteen others were wounded. The governor of Kandahar, Humayoon Azizi, and the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, were among the wounded, but their injuries were not considered life-threatening, said Gen. Abdul Raziq, the security chief of Kandahar Province. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, said in a statement that the officials were in Kandahar “to carry out humanitarian, educational and development projects.” He ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for three days of mourning in his country.
world/asia,The explosions in Kandahar capped a bloody day in Afghanistan. A bombing targeted a meeting of militia commanders in the Helmand provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, killing from seven to 11 people, according to various Afghan officials. Hours later, a double bombing that was claimed by the Taliban killed at least 38 people and wounded 86 others outside the Parliament during the early evening rush hour. Even by the standards of Kandahar, which has a long history of officials and elders being targeted in complex attacks over the years, the extent of the security breach raised questions. To get to the governor’s guesthouse requires passing through multiple security checks, and measures were so tight on Tuesday before the dignitaries’ visit that, according to one official, Mr. Shamsi’s own car was even searched. General Raziq said that an intense investigation into the attack was starting, and that the national security adviser was coming to Kandahar to lead the effort. In an interview, the police commander said the guesthouse had been under construction for months, with about three dozen workers coming to the site each day, raising the possibility that explosives could have been smuggled in that way. “We have detained several people who were working there, and they are under investigation,” General Raziq said. The general, who  has survived dozens of attacks himself, barely escaped this one. He said he had walked out of the hall to offer his evening prayers in the next room when the explosives went off.
world/asia,“I wasn’t finished with my prayers when the loud explosion occurred,” General Raziq said. “It shook the whole building, blew out the windows, and the entire hall was in flames that were out of control.” Many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, Afghan officials said. And despite the government’s formally declaring Mr. Shamsi among the dead, his brother, Fazal Bari Shamsi, said the family had yet to receive the body, which was awaiting DNA testing for identification. On Wednesday, tributes poured in after it was confirmed that Mr. Shamsi was among the dead. President Ashraf Ghani was described as openly grieving, remaining solemn through his morning meeting with aides and describing Mr. Shamsi’s death as a profound loss for the country. “This unfortunate and poor nation had such need for you,” wrote Baryalai Helmand in a Facebook post about Mr. Shamsi. “The martyrdom of youth like you breaks our back.” Shaharzad Akbar, who was one of the founding members of Afghanistan 1400 along with Mr. Shamsi, posted another emotional tribute. “He always gave us morale — in the hardest days he was hopeful, and in the darkest moments patriotic,” Ms. Akbar wrote. “He was more experienced than most of us. With me, a much younger girl with much less experience, he would interact with such respect that it would put me to shame.”
world/asia,The political group found itself developing a side specialty in trying to rebuild after violence. When a gruesome massacre took place in western Farah Province, Mr. Shamsi was among the group of young leaders who traveled to the province to console the residents of the shaken city. As the most experienced of the lot, having dealt with death and violence during his years in Helmand and the American troop surge, he often took the lead in those kinds of delegations. One of Mr. Shamsi’s first acts on the job the day he became deputy governor in August 2015 was to visit the elderly father of his assassinated predecessor, Abdul Qadeem Patyal, to pay his respects. Dawa Khan Meenapal, then the provincial director of culture in Kandahar and currently a deputy spokesman for Mr. Ghani, was with him. “It was the atmosphere of a funeral, especially after Patyal’s children came to the room,” Mr. Meenapal said about the visit. “The two deputy governors before him had been martyred. Shamsi knew that working in Kandahar meant being mentally prepared for that.”
arts/design,Made Before the Boston Tea Party, This Teapot Cost $800,000 - The New York Times
upshot,Betting Markets Weigh the Odds of Vice President Christie - The New York Times Chris Christie’s surprise endorsement of Donald Trump on Friday immediately set tongues wagging about what’s in it for him. After all, Mr. Trump has said of Mr. Christie that “there could certainly be a place for him” as his running mate. Betting markets seem to think that there’s something to this idea. At Ladbrokes, the only major bookmaker betting on the No. 2 slot, Mr. Christie’s odds of being the Republican nominee for vice president were 8 to 1 before a few bets alerted it to the endorsement. The British oddsmaker immediately slashed the odds to 5 to 1, then 4 to 1, and after a flurry of more bets, has further cut Mr. Christie’s odds to 5 to 2. (If you find British odds a mystery, note that this translates to a two-in-seven, or 29 percent, chance.) That said, in lightly traded markets like this, the bookmaker builds in a large profit margin, which exaggerates these probabilities. As such, it’s probably better to say that Mr. Christie’s chances are around 10 to 15 percent. Of course, these odds factor in the uncertainty of Mr. Trump’s becoming the Republican nominee, but Mr. Christie’s endorsement also led bettors to revise their views about that. Mr. Trump’s odds of winning the Republican nomination rose to 73 percent in the hours after Mr. Christie’s endorsement, from 70 percent just prior to that, according to David Rothschild, a keen analyst of prediction markets. It’s a useful bump after a difficult Republican debate, and Mr. Rothschild noted that this three-point rise “is about half the value he lost last night.” (Full disclosure: I was Mr. Rothschild’s doctoral adviser.)
upshot,Mr. Christie is now the market favorite to be the Republican running mate. John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Nikki Haley are the other most likely picks. Matthew Shaddick, head of political odds at Ladbrokes, also noted that he’s “been seeing a bit for money” for Mike Huckabee, whose odds have moved to 10 to 1 from 33 to 1. The next most likely contenders are Sarah Palin and Carly Fiorina. Mr. Shaddick noted in an email that “back in 2008 when Palin was McCain’s pick, she’d been second or third favorite with us for several weeks beforehand.” When Mr. McCain announced his pick, it came as a surprise to many political commentators, but Mr. Shaddick wrote that “if they’d simply looked at the odds, it would have come as no real surprise.” As for Mr. Christie’s chances, Mr. Shaddick admitted that the odds “are probably too short, but I find that people can overreact to this sort of news.”
business,Southern Europe’s Recession Threatens to Spread North - The New York Times FRANKFURT — No company symbolizes German industrial might like Daimler, the giant maker of Mercedes-Benz autos and trucks. So when the company said this week that it, too, had finally been caught in the downdraft of the European economic crisis, it was an ominous sign for all of the Continent, if not the whole world. German exporters like Daimler have been bastions of stability on a continent burdened with shaky banks, dysfunctional governments and legions of unemployed youth — not to mention the worst auto industry slump in two decades. But Daimler’s glum forecast for 2013 was the latest evidence that Germany, and other relatively healthy countries like Austria and Finland, risk falling into the recession that has long afflicted their southern neighbors. The slowdown in Germany was foreshadowed by months of declining industrial output, said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. “The E.U. has made Europe a much more cohesive economy, which is good when things are going up,” he said. “But when things are going down the multiplier is very strong. An outgoing tide lowers all ships.” The region’s overall economic weakness as well as slowing demand in China and other big markets for German exports of consumer products, cars and sophisticated machine tools, industrial robots and construction equipment are finally taking their toll.
business,Just one more consecutive quarter of shrinking economic output and Germany would officially enter a recession. The same is true of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Austria, even Sweden and Finland. The Netherlands has already suffered two quarters of declining gross domestic product. Further evidence of the spreading European recession came Thursday, first from Madrid, where the Spanish government reported that unemployment had reached a record level: 27.2 percent. Then new economic data from London indicated that Britain had barely avoided slipping back into recession for the third time since 2008. “The reality is that Europe still faces severe vulnerabilities that — if unaddressed — could degenerate into a stagnation scenario,” David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in London on Thursday. If Germany slips into recession, much would slide down with it. Germany and the other 26 countries of the European Union together represent the world’s second-largest economy and as a bloc it is the single largest United States trading partner. The further delay in Europe’s recovery that a German recession would cause would seriously hamper growth in the United States, Asia and Latin America. What growth remains in the region is coming mostly from countries in Eastern Europe. Poland is protected by its large domestic market and a healthy banking system. After a severe downturn that began in 2008, growth is rebounding in the Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. In that recession, wages fell, real estate prices dropped and banks worked through the painful process of improving their financial condition.
business,Unemployment there is by no means low, but those countries benefit by being the low-wage economies of Europe. They continue to attract investment of capital. It also helps that those economies, with the exception of Estonia, do not use the euro as their currency. They can adjust their currency more easily to changing economic conditions in the rest of the world, and their economic planners have more policy tools than simply adjusting interest rates. In Germany, there is little overt sign of crisis. Unemployment is 5.4 percent compared with an average of 10.9 percent in Europe. Nevertheless, polls show businesses are growing pessimistic. “The German market cannot decouple from this environment,” Bodo K. Uebber, the Daimler chief financial officer, told analysts Wednesday. The problem for the rest of Europe is that any hope for recovery is pinned on a robust German economy. Companies in Spain and Italy have depended on German demand to compensate for a collapse in consumer spending in their own countries. “In my area there are some enterprises that work 100 percent to serve Germany,” said Mario Moretti Polegato, the founder and chief executive of Geox, a shoemaker based in Montebelluna, Italy, near Venice. Geox, known for shoes with waterproof but breathable soles, sells its products around the world and is not dependent on any one market. Still, Italy accounted for 35 percent of the company’s total revenue last year, and those sales fell 15 percent as Italy remained stuck in a recession that began in mid-2011.
business,Geox sales in Germany helped to offset the decline, Mr. Polegato said by telephone. Germany is also a critical market for his family’s wine business, which sells bubbly prosecco under the Villa Sandi and La Gioiosa brands. “The first market is Germany,” Mr. Polegato said. That is true for most winemakers in the Veneto region, he said. The worst case, said Mr. Weinberg, the economist, would be a depression caused by the failure of political leaders to fix the region’s many weak banks and restore the flow of credit. The worsening economic situation has raised hopes that the European Central Bank will come to the rescue, as it has so often since 2010 when the debt crisis began in the euro zone, the 17 countries in the European Union that use the euro. Somewhat perversely, the dismal economic news this week prompted a rally in stocks and bonds, as investors bet that the unexpectedly bad business surveys would prod the central bank to lower interest rates. Economists now expect the bank to cut its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent when it meets on Thursday in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, another of the few euro zone countries still growing. Many business people would welcome a cut because it would tend to lower the value of the euro compared with the dollar and other major currencies, and make it easier for European exporters to sell their comparatively cheaper products abroad.
business,“It would be a sign that policy makers understand it is time to find a way to compete,” said Marco Tronchetti Provera, chief executive of the Italian tire maker Pirelli. But it is unlikely that a rate cut would address a more fundamental problem in the euro zone: the lack of credit in countries that need it most. Extraordinary measures by the central bank, including virtually unlimited loans to euro zone banks at the rock-bottom official interest rate, have not trickled down to help corporate borrowers in countries like Spain or Italy. The lack of credit is particularly vexing for the small and medium-size companies that are too small to raise money on the bond market and thus depend on banks. Signs of a spreading recession are also strengthening the position of those people who argue that countries like Portugal, Spain and Greece should not be compelled to cut government spending so quickly. They say countries that have budget surpluses, like Germany, should increase spending to stimulate demand. “The fiscal compact is going to kill Europe,” said Mr. Provera of Pirelli, referring to the agreement among euro zone members to reduce deficit spending. Mr. Provera reflects the growing sentiment among leaders like José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, that policy should be more oriented toward growth and not just budget cutting. In an election year, though, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is not likely to forsake the fiscal prudence that has helped make her popular among debt-averse voters.
business,All the talk about austerity — meaning cuts in government spending — may miss the bigger point, though. Many of the most troubled countries have yet to make changes that economists say would spur growth. Reducing the size of a bloated Civil Service and eliminating rules that discourage companies from hiring and firing would not cost very much but many governments consider such moves politically perilous. Germany went through the painful process of rewriting its labor regulations a decade ago, one reason that the economy was able to defy the crisis until recently. In the meantime, Italian companies like Pirelli are trimming jobs in Europe and instead investing in Asia and other markets that seem to offer more promise. Mr. Polegato, the Geox founder, expressed faith that Italian creativity and design would eventually prevail and that the country would recover. But he sounded less certain about the prospects for better government. “A lot of Italian politicians have no feeling for the real economy or business,” he said.
sports/football,Patriots’ Brady Passes and Passes and Passes, and the Bills Are Thrown - The New York Times ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. —  With the Bills relying on a new coach, Rex Ryan, and a new quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, there were some expectations that this meeting between Buffalo and the New England Patriots might finally have a different result. But then the game began at Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday, and it was a familiar story as the Patriots demonstrated why they were the defending Super Bowl champions and had dominated the A.F.C. East for a dozen years. Tom Brady passed for 466 yards, the highest total by a quarterback facing the Bills and the second-highest total of his career, as the Patriots won, 40-32, to push their record to 2-0. “We threw the ball a lot,” said Brady, who had 59 pass attempts. “There will be a lot of different ways to win, and the important thing is to find a way to get the victory — run it, pass it.” Brady and Coach Bill Belichick have always seemed to find a way to prevail at Buffalo, with the Patriots winning 11 of their past 12 road games against the Bills. New England has reached the A.F.C. championship game nine times since the Bills last made the playoffs, in the 1999 season. In the off-season, Buffalo hired Ryan, who is known for his bombast, his defensive schemes and his personal rivalry with Belichick. Ryan had had some close games against the Patriots while coaching the Jets the past six seasons, losing the last four matchups by a combined 9 points.
sports/football,With the Bills, Ryan inherited a dominant defense that had ranked fourth in the N.F.L. in yardage in 2014, when the unit led the league in sacks with 54. Last week, Ryan and some of his defensive players had said how much they disliked the Patriots and were looking forward to playing them. Yet it was the Patriots’ defense that looked superior, sacking Taylor eight times as he made his second N.F.L. start. Under pressure all game, Taylor finished with 242 passing yards and three touchdowns, but he was intercepted three times. Some of Taylor’s finest moments came on the game’s opening drive as Buffalo moved methodically downfield, covering 80 yards in 10 plays, the final one a 2-yard touchdown run by the rookie Karlos Williams. New England went three-and-out on the next possession, and for a brief moment, a shift in the A.F.C.’s balance of power seemed possible. Then the Patriots racked up 21 straight points and seized a 24-13 halftime lead. Outside of a fourth-quarter Buffalo rally, during which the Patriots continued to pass rather than run out the clock, the outcome hardly ever seemed in doubt. Playing three rookies on the offensive line, the Patriots kept Brady well protected against a Bills front four that features three Pro Bowl players. Brady was sacked only twice. “I thought the line did a pretty good job,” the seldom-effusive Belichick said. “I don’t think either sack had anything to do with the offensive line.”
sports/football,New England rushed the ball only 15 times, for 56 yards, preferring to keep the ball in Brady’s hands. And the Buffalo defense mostly refused to blitz Brady, out of respect for his ability to burn it with a quick throw. Instead, Buffalo defenders dropped into coverage in the hopes that the defensive line could generate pressure. “We thought we had an advantage there,” Ryan said, adding, “I’ve been on the wrong end of it a few times when the kid gets hot, and Brady was hot, and if you make a mistake on top of it, he kills you.” As he has done throughout his career, Brady flummoxed a defense. “We knew he was going to get the ball out quick,” Bills linebacker Nigel Bradham said. “Every time we blitzed, we would be right there, and he would throw. He’s not going to take any hits.” Ryan said he had been bested by Belichick, his foil for years. “It’s on my shoulders,” Ryan said. He added: “I have to get better. Belichick outcoached me. No question about it.” Buffalo was also hurt by a lack of discipline, taking 14 penalties, including an unsportsmanlike conduct call on safety Aaron Williams for taunting in the first quarter after a 6-yard run by Dion Lewis had helped New England take a 14-7 lead. Ryan was also flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct for a remark he made to officials.
sports/football,Williams was later involved in a scary sequence in the third quarter. He tried to tackle Julian Edelman as Edelman dived for the end zone on a 22-yard touchdown catch, and after their collision, Williams lay motionless. Teammates gathered around as medical personnel attended to Williams for about 10 minutes, placing him on a gurney and immobilizing his neck. He was loaded into an ambulance on the field and taken to a hospital for tests and was later released, a Bills spokesman said. In the end, perhaps the roller coaster of emotions attached to the matchup, from the chatter beforehand to the game itself, proved too difficult for the Bills to overcome. “You should play with emotion,” Ryan said. “But sometimes you let your emotions get the better of you, and it went to our detriment, and it starts with me. I have to control my emotions a little better regardless of how bad things were going.” Belichick, ever circumspect and monotone, had refused to engage in a war of words with Ryan in the week leading up to the game, and he did not afterward, either. He gave credit to his players, but he made sure to mention that everyone could have done better. “We still left a lot on the field,” he said, suggesting the Patriots could have beaten the Bills by a greater margin. That was as close as he would come to delivering bulletin-board material.
well/family,When Adolescents Want Tattoos or Piercings - The New York Times When I was reviewing for my recertification exam recently, I gave the wrong answer to a question about an infected ear. Not a standard inner ear infection; this was a painful red swollen outer ear, in an 18-year-old. I thought she had a skin abscess, and said to put her on antibiotics for standard skin organisms. Wrong. The adolescent in the problem had recently had a high piercing done, through the cartilage up toward the top of her ear, and she had perichondritis, an infection of the tissue layer that surrounds and nourishes that cartilage. The correct answer was to give her antibiotics that cover Pseudomonas, a particularly nasty bacteria that can live in the external ear canal, but rarely causes any kinds of problems in immunologically normal people.This would be a very bad infection to miss or misdiagnose, since it could go on to cause bad damage to the cartilage itself, leading to deformity of the ear. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its first clinical report on tattooing, piercing and scarification in adolescents and young adults, including a close examination of the medical literature on these increasingly prevalent and increasingly mainstream forms of “body modifications” or “body art.”
well/family,High ear piercings are now common, as are nose piercings and other body piercings. The perichondritis question was included in my review materials in part to remind pediatricians that our adolescent patients may well be considering decorating or modifying their bodies; a Pew Research Center report cited in the new A.A.P. report said that in 2010, among 18- to 29-year-olds, 38 percent had at least one tattoo and 23 percent had a piercing somewhere other than the earlobe. Tattoos, which were once viewed in pediatrics as evidence of a somewhat marginal and high-risk lifestyle, have become sufficiently mainstream that it is now possible to hear college students talk of marking their individuality by not getting tattooed. So many young people have tattoos that in 2015 the military relaxed the rules against them, which were discouraging too many potential recruits — though there are still restrictions against offensive tattoos or most that would be visible in uniform. One of the report’s lead authors, Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, who is a professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Seattle Children’s Hospital, and the chairwoman of the A.A.P. Committee on Adolescence, said, “It should be brought up at adolescent visits: ‘Have you considered getting a tattoo, a piercing, where?’” Pediatricians should be asking questions like, “Have you talked to your parents? Do you understand it’s permanent?” Dr. Breuner suggests that a child who wants a tattoo might consider a temporary tattoo first to see what it’s like to walk around with the decoration; parents can also suggest a waiting period, even for a young adult, before going ahead.
well/family,And the somewhat fraught area of “body modification” and “body art” can become an arena for discussing the nature of permanent decisions, body autonomy and personal health. Opening the conversation could be an opportunity to emphasize the permanent nature of a tattoo (the report goes into the difficulties and the expense of tattoo removal, and also the limited success in many cases), and also to bring up the question of how a visible tattoo or piercing could affect employment opportunities later on. (And it’s not just a question of not being able to get a job in a more conservative setting; I recently heard about young actors with tattoos who have to show up extra early to get their tattoos covered with body makeup, or who sometimes get passed over for parts.) “I don’t think health care practitioners should be critical or judgmental,” Dr. Breuner said. “That just drives the whole thing back into the alley.” Doctors should urge teenagers considering tattoos or piercings to have these conversations with their parents, and to make sure that anything that gets done is done in a licensed and sanitary place, and that tetanus immunizations are up-to-date. And for adolescents who have had issues in the past with scarring, or who may have compromised immune systems — those who have lupus, for example, or those who have had cancer and may want a tattoo at the site of a scar — it’s an opportunity to review why this may be higher risk.
well/family,The legal rules on minors getting tattoos and body piercings vary from state to state; some states prohibit it outright, others allow it with parental consent, and still others require parental presence. But ideally, Dr. Breuner said, this should not just be a conversation in which a parent says ‘Absolutely not,’ and a child hears, ‘I just have to wait till I’m old enough.’ Instead of that firm no, especially with older adolescents, parents should consider offering “a firm maybe, let’s get more information so you don’t do something you wish you hadn’t done.” When her own daughter, at 18, went to get her belly button pierced five years ago, Dr. Breuner accompanied her. “It wasn’t like I condoned it or hated it — I just wanted to be there to support her,” she said. “I wanted to make sure it was clean and sterile, and it was,” Dr. Breuner said. Sterile procedures were strictly observed, she said, including three changes of gloves. “I asked the guy, ‘What did you do before,’ and he was a surgical tech.” But germs can get in when the skin is pierced, and one important role for doctors is to manage infections or complications. And there are certainly health considerations to be aware of — like the risks of skin infections after tattoos and piercings, but also including the transmission of blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis C if sterile procedures are not followed carefully All the risks are much higher with amateur tattooing and piercing than with licensed professionals.
well/family,When going to get a tattoo or a piercing, the report recommends, look for such evidence of sterile procedures as the use of new gloves, new needles or piercing equipment removed from sterile containers, and fresh ink poured into a disposable container for each new customer. Reputable professionals should provide ample follow-up instructions, which should be carefully read and followed. Watch for the signs of infection, redness, swelling, any evidence of pus or drainage, and of course, fever, and red streaking lines on the skin. If a recent piercing continues to bleed, it may be that a blood vessel was hit and it isn’t clotting properly. All of these problems should be seen by a doctor — and ideally the doctor will be up on my test question and others like it. It’s also important to keep up the vigilance; body piercings can take much longer to heal than many teenagers realize — the eyebrow, for example, takes six to eight weeks, but the navel can take up to nine months. Many body piercings have other implications for health, from the tooth chipping associated with tongue piercings (not to mention the risk of a piece of jewelry getting into the airway) to the problems with later breast-feeding that can follow nipple piercings. I have taken care of teenagers with tongue piercings, and my general reaction, I have to admit, is: “Oh, yuck.” But as Dr. Breuner said, “Our job as pediatricians is to be sure our kids are taken care of.” And part of our job as parents is to help our adolescent children negotiate the complex journey to full adulthood and autonomy, which includes taking care of themselves.
sports/football,Doctors Fault Assumptions of Settlement With Retirees - The New York Times A leading brain injury advocacy group said the proposed settlement between the N.F.L. and nearly 5,000 former players who sued the league for hiding from them the dangers of concussions is flawed because the definitions of eligibility are too narrow. In a filing with the United States District Court in Philadelphia, two doctors from the Brain Injury Association of America said the tests that retired players would take to determine whether they could receive a cash award primarily identify problems of cognition, like memory loss and ability to organize thoughts, not other conditions associated with brain trauma like mood swings and aggressive behavior. “To be maximally effective at identifying those players with residual deficits, it is well accepted by the brain injury professional community that an approach that is more holistic, human-based and less linguistically reliant is preferred,” the doctors wrote in request to file a friend-of-the-court brief. The doctors — the association’s current and former national medical directors — said the proposed settlement, which all retired players are now being asked to accept or opt out of, will exclude many players and limit their access to medical benefits and compensation. The settlement, which would pay cash awards of up to $5 million to players with severe neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease, would include smaller payments to players with fewer than five years in the N.F.L. on the presumption that they absorbed fewer hits to the head.
sports/football,Older players would receive smaller awards than younger players because they are thought to be more likely to develop conditions like Alzheimer’s disease because of their age, not because they played football. The doctors said both assumptions were incorrect. A player, they said, could get a major concussion or a series of smaller concussions in his first year in the league. They added that the “consequences of a brain injury are the same” no matter when one receives a concussion. Hundreds of players have indicated they may opt out of the settlement, which would preserve their right to continue suing the league. Several players also asked a federal appeals court to intervene in the case to amend what they claimed were flaws in the settlement, but that request was rejected. “This is an extraordinary settlement for retired N.F.L. players and their families — from those who suffer with neurocognitive illnesses today, to those who are currently healthy but fear they may develop symptoms decades into the future,” Christopher Seeger, a lead class lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Our focus remains on finalizing this agreement so that former N.F.L. players can soon begin taking advantage of its benefits.” All retired N.F.L. players have until mid-October to opt out or accept the settlement. Anita B. Brody, the judge in the case, has scheduled a fairness hearing for Nov. 19, when she is expected to hear objections from those opposed to the settlement. If she approves the settlement, with or without any significant changes, players can still appeal. No cash awards would be paid until all appeals are exhausted.
sports/football,JETS SIGN FULLBACK The Jets added a fullback, signing John Conner, who played with them from 2010 to 2012. Conner, the team’s fifth-round pick in 2010, replaces Tommy Bohanon, who was placed on injured reserve on Tuesday after fracturing his clavicle in Sunday’s loss to Detroit. BEN SHPIGEL F.C.C. TO CONSIDER NICKNAME The head of the Federal Communications Commission said the agency would consider a petition to bar the Washington Redskins nickname from public airwaves. Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, said Tuesday that the commission “will be dealing with that issue on the merits, and we’ll be responding accordingly.” A law professor has challenged the use of the name on television, saying it violates F.C.C. rules against indecent content. American Indian and other groups have demanded the name be changed, calling it a racial slur. Wheeler did not offer a timetable for a ruling. He has said he finds the name “offensive and derogatory.” Daniel Snyder, the team’s owner, has vowed to never change the name. (AP)
us,Highlights of the Same-Sex Marriage Decision - The New York Times The United States Supreme Court decided on Monday to let stand appeals court rulings allowing same-sex marriages in five states. Below is a summary of the decision’s practical significance. • Until Monday, 19 states and the District of Columbia allowed same-sex marriage. • The decision by the Supreme Court to deny review of seven petitions from five states means that the number of states with same-sex marriage will shortly climb to 24. The appeals court decisions the justices let stand are likely to apply to another six states, bringing the number to 30. • Several federal appeals courts have yet to rule and it seems the Supreme Court will not intercede until one of them upholds a state ban. • Officials in Virginia, Wisconsin and Utah said they would begin conducting same-sex marriages on Monday.
technology/personaltech,Enlarge the Screen in Windows 10 - The New York Times Q. I recently discovered the keyboard shortcut in Windows 10 that automatically zooms in the whole screen, but it’s often a little too close-up. Is there a way to adjust this zooming? A. Pressing the Windows and plus (+) keys together automatically activates the Magnifier, the built-in Ease of Access utility for enlarging the screen, and yes, you can adjust the level of magnification. (For those who have found the shortcut by accident, pressing the Windows and Escape keys turns off the Magnifier.) To change the magnification level, press the Windows, Control and M keys to open the Magnifier settings box. (You can also take the long way by going to the Start menu, clicking the gear-shaped settings icon on the left side, choosing the Ease of Access icon and then selecting Magnifier.) When the settings box opens, go to the Magnifier options area and under “Zoom level increments,” select a smaller percentage than the default 100 percent. Choosing a lower number — like 25 percent — gives you smaller degrees of magnification for zooming. For example, instead of zooming in by 100 percent each time you press the Windows and + keys to turn on the Magnifier and then increase the zoom level of the screen, you can zoom in more gradually in 25-percent increments as you repeatedly press the keyboard shortcut.
technology/personaltech,The Magnifier utility has quite a few shortcuts of its own, which can save you from fiddling with the mouse while you enlarge parts of the desktop for easier reading. To see the list of commands, scroll down to the Keyboard Shortcuts section of the Magnifier settings box. Mac users have a similar screen-magnification tool that comes with macOS. To turn on the Zoom feature and adjust its behavior, click the System Preferences icon in the Mac’s desktop dock and in the System Preferences box, click Accessibility. On the left side of the Accessibility box, click Zoom to get to the feature’s settings.

us/politics,Hillary Clinton’s Team Is Wary as Bernie Sanders Finds Footing in Iowa - The New York Times The ample crowds and unexpectedly strong showing garnered by Senator Bernie Sanders are setting off worry among advisers and allies of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who believe the Vermont senator could overtake her in Iowa polls by the fall and even defeat her in the nation’s first nominating contest there. The enthusiasm that Mr. Sanders has generated — including a rally attended by 2,500 people in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Friday — has called into question Mrs. Clinton’s early strategy of focusing on a listening tour of small groups and wooing big donors in private settings. In May, Mrs. Clinton led with 60 percent support to Mr. Sanders’s 15 percent in a Quinnipiac poll. Last week the same poll showed Mrs. Clinton at 52 percent to Mr. Sanders’s 33 percent. “We are worried about him, sure. He will be a serious force for the campaign, and I don’t think that will diminish,” Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign’s communications director, said Monday in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Some of Mrs. Clinton’s advisers acknowledged that they were surprised by Mr. Sanders’s momentum and said there were enough liberal voters in Iowa, including many who supported Barack Obama or John Edwards in 2008, to create problems for her there.
us/politics,“I think we underestimated that Sanders would quickly attract so many Democrats in Iowa who weren’t likely to support Hillary,” said one Clinton adviser, who like several others spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly share views about the race. “It’s too early to change strategy because no one knows if Sanders will be able to hold on to these voters in the months ahead. We’re working hard to win them over, but, yeah, it’s a real competition there.” Asked on Friday about the crowds Mr. Sanders was drawing, Mrs. Clinton seemed to walk a careful line with her answer. “Well, we each run our own campaigns, and I always knew this was going to be competitive,” she told reporters at an ice cream stand in Lebanon, N.H. Those who see Mrs. Clinton as being at risk in Iowa say she is still far better positioned to win the nomination than Mr. Sanders, who lags by double digits in Iowa polling. Mr. Sanders is an untested national candidate who has far less money than she does, and his self-announced “democratic socialist” leanings are anathema to many Americans. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, meanwhile, have deep experience pulling off upsets and comeback political victories, and Mrs. Clinton often performs best when she is under pressure from rivals. But a loss in an early state like Iowa would signal a vulnerability for Mrs. Clinton at a time when she has sought to unite the Democratic Party behind her candidacy, and especially to demonstrate to its restless liberal wing that she can represent their interests. A Sanders victory could also further energize his fund-raising base.
us/politics,“Certainly she could lose Iowa,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed Howard Dean’s 2004 campaign. If that happened, Mr. Trippi said, “mostly they’d just have to ride out the punditry and people with their hair on fire” and go on to capture the nomination. Mr. Sanders’s rising fortunes pose a bind for the Clinton team. Directly challenging the senator on his policies and record could elevate his candidacy, alienate some liberal Democrats and make Mrs. Clinton look anxious. Yet continuing the current strategy — vigorously courting voters while hoping they conclude that Mr. Sanders is unelectable — requires Mrs. Clinton to put faith in an Iowa electorate that snubbed her seven years ago, choosing Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards over her. Whatever the outcome in Iowa, the Clinton campaign, which raised $45 million in its first three months, already is building a national infrastructure, with one or more organizers, at least temporarily, in each state. Carter Eskew, a Democratic political consultant, said the strength of the Sanders candidacy should stop further talk of a “coronation” of Mrs. Clinton as the Democratic nominee. “From the Clinton perspective, Sanders has gone from an annoyance to a threat,” he said. “One consolation, Sanders won’t creep up on anybody anymore. The Clinton camp has time to adjust expectations, if not strategy.”
us/politics,Mrs. Clinton has also spent so much time at fund-raisers, most of which bring in more than $27,000, according to campaign reports, that she has not made as many stops in Iowa as her opponent. On Tuesday, she will hold events in Iowa City (where Mr. Sanders drew a crowd of several hundred in late May) and Ottumwa. In the coming weeks, she is expected to make more frequent visits to the state and hold larger events, delivering her message of lifting the middle class. Hours after her loss there in 2008, Mrs. Clinton’s aides played down Iowa’s importance, with one aide comparing the caucuses to “a mayor’s race in a medium-sized city.” Her current team has been careful not to diminish the state’s importance and has been pouring in money and staffing. She has dozens of paid staff members there compared with about 20 for Mr. Sanders. “The caucus is about working hard, with humility, to engage Iowans” said Matt Paul, Mrs. Clinton’s state director for Iowa. To that end, the campaign has recruited volunteers to caucus for Mrs. Clinton in each of the state’s 1,682 precincts. “We take nothing for granted in Iowa because the caucuses are always such a tough proving ground,” said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. “But Hillary Clinton’s regular travel to the state and the organization we have established on the ground show how committed we are to prevailing there.” (A Vermont native, Mr. Mook has known Mr. Sanders and his organizing playbook since the 1990s and has been warning the campaign about his potential rise.)
us/politics,Advisers to Mr. Sanders said voters flocked to his events because he offers ambitious proposals to major problems, such as his plans to eliminate tuition at public colleges, to reduce student debt and to spend $1 trillion on public works programs to create more jobs, though he proposed paying for them with huge tax increases. His advisers also argued that voters viewed him as willing to go further in championing significant tax increases for wealthy Americans to support programs to benefit low- and middle-income Americans. “I’ve been struck by the large numbers of people who are saying they want to sign on the dotted line and support his campaign, organize their community, help in any way they can,” said Pete D’Alessandro, a veteran Iowa operative who is overseeing the Sanders campaign there. His advisers dismissed any notion from Mrs. Clinton’s allies that she was anything but the clear front-runner in Iowa. “That’s just political chatter and the usual tactics,” said Jeff Weaver, the senator’s campaign manager. “What’s important is what we saw at Bernie’s recent event in Wisconsin — a candidate speaking to the issues facing Americans, and 10,000 people coming out for it.” While Mr. Sanders’s crowds make for powerful images, Mrs. Clinton’s allies pointed out that his largest rallies had been in handpicked locations like Madison, Wis., and Iowa City, where there are many college-educated white liberals, a demographic that represents his base. Mrs. Clinton draws stronger support from African-Americans, Latino voters and moderate voters.
us/politics,Regardless, big crowds mean more cash for Mr. Sanders, who said his campaign had raised $15 million since April 30. And Mrs. Clinton’s Internet fund-raising has room to grow as the campaign seeks to build its database of small-dollar donors, a tough proposition without big rallies. Of the roughly two million supporters from 2008, the campaign said, it has only about 100,000 active email accounts. Jan Bauer, the Democratic chairwoman of Story County, compared Mr. Sanders to Mr. Dean, also of Vermont, whose antiwar liberalism took Iowa by storm in 2004 before John Kerry rallied in the final days before the caucuses and later captured the nomination. “You don’t know what’s going to happen until you get to those last two weeks,” Ms. Bauer said.
world/asia,Tajik Police Commander, Trained in U.S., Appears to Rise in Islamic State Ranks - The New York Times MOSCOW — In a propaganda video released last year, an Islamic State militant wearing a black bandanna and cradling a sniper rifle made the usual grim threats against the United States. Now, there may be a new twist to his warnings. The militant, Gulmurod Khalimov, a former police commander from Tajikistan, boasted of his extensive American military training — truthfully, it turns out. But some news accounts say he was subsequently promoted to military commander of the Islamic State. “I was in America three times,” Mr. Khalimov said in the video, which appeared online last year. “God willing, I will come with this weapon to your cities, to your homes, and we will kill you.” That prospect remains highly unlikely. But there is no doubt that as he rose in the ranks of a special police force in Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, Mr. Khalimov received extensive taxpayer-funded military training from the United States to help counter drug-running and extremism along the border with Afghanistan. Now, Mr. Khalimov appears to have become the second senior commander of the Islamic State, the terrorist group he defected to last year, to have benefited from American military training provided to former Soviet states. Mr. Khalimov’s precise rank is unclear; he could be the group’s so-called minister of war, or military commander in chief. In any case, the State Department, which oversaw his training, thinks he is important enough that on Aug. 30, it offered a $3 million reward for information on his whereabouts. The Islamic State’s previous military commander was killed in an airstrike earlier this year.
world/asia,The State Department has been publicizing the reward in Tajikistan, where relatives or acquaintances might have salient information. Kurt R. Rice, the department’s acting assistant director for threat investigations, told Tajik journalists in September that Mr. Khalimov’s American training made him a particular danger, but he did not elaborate on Mr. Khalimov’s role in the terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “He can use this knowledge to create difficulties for our countries,” Mr. Rice said. “He’s a person who can create difficulties.” Mr. Rice’s office declined a request to interview him about Mr. Khalimov’s training, citing his travel schedule. After the State Department announced the reward, an Iraqi news agency, Alsumaria, reported that Mr. Khalimov had been promoted to military commander for the Islamic State, replacing Omar al-Shishani, an ethnic Chechen from Georgia who was killed in the airstrike. Russian news outlets have also said Mr. Khalimov was promoted, but neither those accounts nor the Iraqi report could be independently verified. “The U.S. putting a bounty on his head is significant,” Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization, in London, said in a telephone interview. “But it’s not possible to know if he’s the strategist of military operations.” Further muddying the picture, the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist propaganda, has found no formal Islamic State announcement of Mr. Khalimov’s position, according to Adam Raisman, an analyst who studies the group’s postings.
world/asia,If Mr. Khalimov was, in fact, promoted, he would be the second Islamic State commander in chief to have been trained in American military aid programs in the former Soviet Union. Mr. Shishani, whose real name was Tarkhan Batirashvili, had served in the Georgian Army, which is equipped and funded by the United States as a bulwark against Russian expansion. American military aid to Tajikistan is more narrowly focused on fighting terrorism and narcotics, because the country is a close ally of Russia. The aid has flowed even though Tajikistan is ruled by an eccentric and authoritarian president, Emomali Rahmon, whose police forces are often accused of abuses. Along with jailing dissidents and using excessive force — in one case, killing 20 civilians in a paramilitary action — Mr. Rahmon’s police forces have been accused of more unusual human rights abuses. A provincial governor recently said that he had forcibly shaved the beards of 13,000 men suspected of sympathizing with fundamentalist Islamists. Muhiddin Kabiri, the exiled leader of Tajikistan’s main opposition party, the Islamic Renaissance Party, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Khalimov “was always against the moderate opposition” and that his police unit was known for abuses, but that the United States had turned a blind eye. The State Department provided five training courses for Mr. Khalimov, three of them in the United States, including at least one run by the company once known as Blackwater in Baton Rouge, La. A spokesman has said the department vetted Mr. Khalimov and did not violate the Leahy Law, which prohibits the government from providing military training to foreign military units that violate human rights.
world/asia,With American training programs on his résumé, Mr. Khalimov became commander of a paramilitary police force in 2013, raising alarm among human rights groups about the training even before he defected to the Islamic State. “The U.S. military has been providing a lot of expertise and training to abusive and repressive governments in Central Asia,” Steve Swerdlow, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview. “Military cooperation has to be contingent on human rights,” Mr. Swerdlow said. “Tajikistan got a free pass despite the atrocious situation with human rights.” American military training programs are generally carried out by the Defense Department but overseen by the State Department, an arrangement that broke down in Tajikistan, according to a 2015 report by the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General that looked into the American response to the Tajik police operation that killed 20 civilians in 2012. Mr. Khalimov, then a deputy commander of the special police unit, took part in that operation but still continued his American military training until 2013. The report found that the Office of Military Cooperation, the Pentagon group that arranged training for the suspect police units, had also conducted the investigation into the killings — effectively determining that Mr. Khalimov’s training was legal — rather than the political section of the United States Embassy in Tajikistan, which should have overseen the military education programs. The report concluded that the lack of oversight undermined “confidence that the embassy provides a full and reliable picture of local developments.”
world/asia,While it is unclear exactly what training Mr. Khalimov received, a 2008 diplomatic cable from the embassy released by WikiLeaks explained what the paramilitary police and other units requested. The groups wanted training in “mission analysis and the military decision making process, intelligence preparation of the battlefield, direct action, raids and ambushes, special reconnaissance, close quarters combat and battle, sniper and observe operations, military operations in urban terrain.”
us,Biden Calls Victim in Stanford Rape Case a ‘Warrior’ - The New York Times The furor surrounding a Stanford rape case extended to the nation’s capital on Thursday: A congresswoman read an excerpt from the victim’s statement on the House floor, a congressman called for the judge to be removed, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wrote an open letter to the victim, calling her “a warrior — with a solid steel spine.” In his letter, obtained by BuzzFeed, Mr. Biden expressed his “furious anger” over the sexual assault — for which a former Stanford student, Brock Turner, 20, was convicted in March — and his disappointment in a culture that “continues to ask the wrong questions” of victims. “I do not know your name — but your words are forever seared on my soul, words that should be required reading for men and women of all ages,” he wrote, referring to the powerful statement the 23-year-old woman read in court during a sentencing hearing in Santa Clara County Superior Court last week. The case  spurred national outrage  when Mr. Turner, a former Stanford swimmer, received a six-month sentence and three years probation by Judge Aaron Persky after being convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault for his attack on an intoxicated and unconscious woman behind a Dumpster. Critics of the judge’s sentencing have begun an effort to recall him, even as others have defended his decisions, and threats of violence have flooded the California court’s phone lines.
us,Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, speaking from the House floor on Thursday, called the six-month sentence a “travesty” and said that she was working on “several pieces of legislation” to aid the survivors of sexual assault and harassment. “Our justice system must become better than this,” she said. “Our educational system must become better than this.” She then read an excerpt from the victim’s 7,244-word statement, saying that “her bravery inspires me as I hope it will inspire you.” The victim’s statement, published by BuzzFeed on June 3, was also read on the air by a CNN anchor on Monday. Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, along with a group of celebrities and government officials, read it aloud on Wednesday in a video that was posted to Facebook. Representative Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas who also read an excerpt from the statement on the House floor, said that Judge Persky should be removed from the bench. “Victims like this remarkable woman must know that society and the justice system are on their side,” Mr. Poe said Thursday. In other developments: • Two of the women who had written character statements on behalf of Mr. Turner apologized Wednesday for supporting him. Leslie Rasmussen, the drummer for the band Good English, which had several of its shows canceled after news of her support became public, posted her apology on Facebook.
us,“I did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of Brock’s crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured, and for that lack of acknowledgment, I am deeply sorry,” she wrote. • In her speech, Ms. Speier noted that Mr. Turner will most likely serve half of his sentence. Online records show that Mr. Turner, who was booked on June 2, is expected to be released from the Santa Clara County jail on Sept. 2. It is not uncommon for county jail inmates to serve 50 percent of their sentences if they keep a clean disciplinary record. Calls to the county Department of Corrections weren’t immediately returned Thursday.
business/media,‘Birthers’ Fanned Flames of Conspiracy for Years - The New York Times The facts about Barack Obama’s birth never wavered. But the more the fraudulent theories were debated and dispelled in major news media outlets, the more people seemed to believe them. The conspiracy theories were promulgated on the Internet and by fringe publishers in the early days of the Obama presidency, and they were encouraged by right-wing radio and television hosts and, more recently, by Donald J. Trump, who is toying with a Republican run for president. The theories asserted that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya, and is therefore not eligible to be president. In waves of media coverage — the vast majority of it critical of the so-called “birther” position — reporters tried to debunk those theories. But opinion polls found that doubts among Americans about his citizenship grew over time, as if the very fact of the debate caused the issue to fester in more minds. “It seemed to really be getting traction in the polls,” said Mark Whitaker, the managing editor of CNN Worldwide. That, he said, was why CNN dispatched a camera crew to Hawaii last week to fact-check the conspiracy theories, something it had done three years ago, when Mr. Obama first released legal proof of his eligibility while running for president. Mr. Whitaker said he thought the poll numbers were a primary reason why the White House released Mr. Obama’s long-form birth certificate on Wednesday. But the debunked theories are likely to persist in some circles.
business/media,“There is a veritable fantasy industry at work online and in the book publishing industry; there are dollars to be made,” wrote David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, on Wednesday. He said it was “plainly true” that persistent rumor-mongering surrounding the president is “designed to arouse a fear of the Other, of an African-American man with a white American mother and a black Kenyan father.” Some conservative Web sites have delighted in the perceived distrust in the president and his origins. “It is important to remember there are still dozens of other questions concerning this question of eligibility that need to be resolved,” Joseph Farah, the editor of one such site, WorldNetDaily, wrote Wednesday. His site had dozens of articles related to Mr. Obama’s birth on its home page. A book by Jerome Corsi to be published in mid-May, “Where’s the Birth Certificate? The Case That Barack Obama Is Not Eligible to Be President,” raced to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-seller list last week after the Drudge Report featured it prominently. On Wednesday it was ranked No. 35 on the ever-changing list. Most in the news media do not share Mr. Farah and Mr. Corsi’s view. There was distaste evident in the voices of television anchors while they talked about the citizenship issue on Wednesday; the MSNBC anchor Contessa Brewer, reading feedback from viewers, said many were “angry at the media for even covering the Trump birther nonsense.”
business/media,At the White House, the NBC correspondent Chuck Todd wondered aloud if Google and its ilk — which enable instant access to all manner of information — cannot be “starved,” then how should the media handle “crazy lies?” Mr. Todd said on NBC that “the ability to get a conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it’s so much easier today than it was even 20 years ago, 10, 5 years.” Most segments of the media kept the so-called “birther” movement at arm’s length when it emerged in the early months of the Obama presidency. By then, legal proof of Mr. Obama’s birth had already been released and groups like FactCheck.org had verified its authenticity. But murmurs on Internet forums led to whispers on talk radio. Some hosts shrugged it off, but others, like Rush Limbaugh and Lou Dobbs, questioned why the long-form birth certificate had not been released. Only after Mr. Trump spoke out did it become a major topic for the news media. Fox News Channel commentators, who had rarely invoked the issue, started bringing it up, as did their guests; Sean Hannity, Fox’s 9 p.m. host, asked repeatedly in March, “Why can’t they just release the birth certificate?” Indexing of last week’s news coverage by the Project for Excellence in Journalism found that of the three main cable news channels, MSNBC hosts spent substantially more time talking about the citizenship issue than those on CNN or Fox News. What were they saying? That the theory was ludicrous.
magazine,How the President Got to ‘I Do’ on Same-Sex Marriage - The New York Times By presidential fund-raising standards, the dinner at the St. Regis hotel in Washington in April 2011 was an intimate one. President Obama made the rounds, moving among the dozens of people in attendance, including Chad Griffin, a 37-year-old political operative known for his ability to raise money in Hollywood and for his work on trying to legalize same-sex marriage. It was Griffin who persuaded the conservative lawyer Theodore B. Olson and the liberal attorney David Boies, adversaries in the 2000 Bush v. Gore case, to bring a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 8, the amendment banning same-sex marriage that voters approved in 2008. Griffin and a team of veteran political operatives were using the litigation to mount a campaign intended to frame same-sex marriage as a civil right. They were working to create a political climate that would make the Supreme Court, which was disinclined to get too far out in front of public opinion, comfortable enough to rule in their favor. But the president was standing in their way. His opposition to same-sex marriage had been cited repeatedly by Proposition 8’s defenders as evidence that people who wanted to retain the traditional definition of marriage were not motivated by prejudice. Though Obama had recently taken to saying that his views on the matter were “evolving,” Griffin worried that they were moving too slowly to help with his cause.
magazine,For Griffin, who grew up in Arkansas and struggled to come out as gay, the legal fight was about more than just the ability to wed. Bans like Proposition 8 sent a signal that there was something inherently wrong with gay men and lesbians and, in his view, amounted to a kind of state sanctioning of a host of ills, from schoolyard bullying to hate crimes to statistics that showed that gay teenagers were far more likely than their straight counterparts to contemplate suicide. As he watched the president move from table to table at the St. Regis, chatting and smiling and taking questions, Griffin waited for his turn. When Obama finally arrived, he willed himself to be direct. “Mr. President,” he said, “how can we help you evolve more quickly?” When I spoke with Griffin a few days later, he recalled Obama’s saying, “I think you can tell from what I have done so far the direction that I am headed.” The president was referring to his successful push to repeal the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which prohibited openly gay men and lesbians from serving, and his administration’s decision to stop supporting in federal court the Defense of Marriage Act, a Clinton-era law known as DOMA that denied federal spousal benefits to gay couples who married where it was already legal, in five states and the District of Columbia.
magazine,“The sense I got from him,” Griffin said, “was, ‘Give me credit — look what I have already done.’ ” But Obama’s campaign for a second term was in full swing, and he was not going to be pushed any further on the issue. A few months later at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles, Griffin had a private conversation with Michelle Obama, in which she indicated that her husband had given as much support as he could at the time. Her message, he told his team, was clear: “Hang in there with us, and we’ll be with you after the election.” Despite the president’s stated opposition, even his top advisers didn’t believe that he truly opposed allowing gay couples to marry. “He has never been comfortable with his position,” David Axelrod, then one of his closest aides, told me. Indeed, long before Obama publicly stated that he was against same-sex marriage, he was on the record supporting it. As an Illinois State Senate candidate from Chicago’s liberal Hyde Park enclave, Obama signed a questionnaire in 1996 saying, “I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.” But as his ambitions grew, and with them the need to appeal to a more politically diverse electorate, his position shifted. In the course of an unsuccessful run for a House seat in 2000, he said he was “undecided” on the question. By the time he campaigned for the presidency, he had staked out an even safer political position: Citing his Christian faith, he said he believed marriage to be the sacred union of a man and a woman.
magazine,The assumption going into the 2012 campaign was that there was little to be gained politically from the president’s coming down firmly in favor of same-sex marriage. In particular, his political advisers were worried that his endorsement could splinter the coalition needed to win a second term, depressing turnout among socially conservative African-Americans, Latinos and white working-class Catholics in battleground states. But by November 2011, it was becoming increasingly clear that continuing to sidestep the issue came with its own set of costs. The campaign’s internal polling revealed that the issue was a touchstone for likely Obama voters under 30. The campaign needed those voters to turn out in the record numbers they had four years earlier, and the biggest impediment was Obama’s refusal to say he favored allowing gay couples to wed. “We understood that this would be galvanizing to some voters and be difficult with other voters,” said Jim Messina, the manager of Obama’s 2012 campaign. Caught between countervailing political forces, Obama called his top aides together and said that if asked again for his position, he both wanted and needed to drop the pretense and tell people where he really stood. “The politics of authenticity — not just the politics, but his own sense of authenticity — required that he finally step forward,” Axelrod said. “And the president understood that.”
magazine,But if he was really contemplating an endorsement of same-sex marriage, his advisers urged him to do it in a manner that caused minimal political damage. David Plouffe, a mastermind of the 2008 victory and a senior adviser to the president, reached out to Ken Mehlman for advice. The previous year, Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who engineered President George W. Bush’s re-election, came out as gay and began working with the foundation Griffin set up to fund the Proposition 8 lawsuit, attracting well-known G.O.P. donors, strategists and officials to the cause. Mehlman had already met with Obama over lunch at the White House and told him that people voted for him in 2008 because they viewed him as an idealist who would put politics aside and do what was right. Endorsing same-sex marriage would remind voters that he was still that man. “The notion that politically this is going to kill you — I don’t buy it,” Mehlman recalled saying. He told Plouffe that voters were far more likely to be supportive once they understood that gay couples wanted to marry for the same reason straight people did: It was a matter of love and commitment. Polling indicated that voters would best respond if the issue was framed around shared American values: the country’s fundamental promise of equality; voters’ antipathy toward government intrusion into their private lives; and the religious principle of treating others the way one would like to be treated.
magazine,Mehlman surveyed 5,000 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and found that a majority supported some form of legal recognition of gay relationships. Generally, marriage was not a top priority for most Republicans, meaning that a presidential endorsement was unlikely to motivate the G.O.P. base or attract the kind of full-throated Republican criticism it might have in years past. On Nov. 10, 2011, Mehlman sent Plouffe an email suggesting that the president announce his support for same-sex marriage in a TV interview with a female host. He also laid out specific language for Obama to use. Explain that this was a family decision and not a political one, he advised: “Michelle and I have been having a similar conversation in our family that lots of American families have been having on marriage equality.I fully understand that some will agree, while others will disagree, with where our family has come down on this.” Mehlman advised Obama to talk about his daughters — “as Michelle and I have been thinking through what we teach Sasha and Malia about America’s greatness” — and about religious liberty and fairness to all. “When you’re president, you’re president of all Americans. And all includes gays and lesbians — men and women who are serving across this country — firefighters, doctors, teachers, courageous soldiers who serve and protect the rest of us.” Plouffe responded to the email immediately: “Thanks for this.”
magazine,But then nothing happened. A cardinal rule of politics is that if an issue has the potential to cause problems for a candidate, it is best to deal with it well before the election so the dust has time to settle. Yet months went by without Obama making any kind of announcement. Inside the White House, the first lady urged her husband to declare his support for same-sex marriage. The Obamas had a number of gay friends, and though the White House kept it quiet, the first lady attended a wedding celebration for her hairdresser when he married his husband. She felt strongly that her husband had the power to transform the national conversation on marriage equality. And it was not lost on the president that his failure so far to do that was “a source of disappointment to people who otherwise appreciated him,” Axelrod said. Valerie Jarrett, a longtime friend of the Obamas and a top adviser who served as the president’s liaison to gay voters, also encouraged him to go public. This is consistent with who you are, she told him. That winter, national polls showed that support for same-sex marriage was beginning to exceed opposition to it. A clear majority of Democrats favored allowing gay couples to wed. Forty-eight major American companies had signed on to a legal brief arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act negatively affected their businesses, and corporate leaders, including the chief executive of Starbucks and the chairman of Goldman Sachs, had come down on the side of marriage equality. The list of Republicans publicly supporting same-sex marriage now included the former first lady Laura Bush; Steve Schmidt, who helped run Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign against Obama in 2008; McCain’s wife and daughter; and Grover Norquist, the conservative anti-tax activist.
magazine,But for all the political and corporate cover, Obama’s political advisers remained worried that the costs outweighed the benefits — a fear that intensified as it became clear that North Carolina, a battleground state that Obama narrowly won in 2008, was poised to easily pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. “This was so past the sell-by date,” one senior administration official said of the timing of an announcement by the president, “yet there was still no real plan in place. It just shows you how scared everyone was of this issue.” On April 19, 2012, Chad Griffin was at the Los Angeles home of Michael Lombardo, an HBO executive, and his husband, Sonny Ward, an architect, waiting for the guest of honor to arrive. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was scheduled to meet a group of prominent gay Democrats whom Griffin had helped gather at the request of the Obama campaign. Mehlman’s exchange with Plouffe had briefly raised Griffin’s hopes that the president would embrace the same-sex marriage cause. But now, with the election looming and nothing to indicate that Obama was willing to heed the advice, he had all but given up on the White House.
magazine,Griffin considered asking Biden about the administration’s position on the issue but decided not to bother — he already knew the answer. But as he watched the hosts’ two children, ages 5 and 7, press flowers and a note into Biden’s hand, he changed his mind. They were in the home of two married men and their family. The Obama campaign wanted the support of the gay people in this room. The vice president should have to answer to them. When it was Griffin’s turn to speak, he said: “When you came in tonight, you met Michael and Sonny and their two beautiful kids. And I wonder if you can just sort of talk in a frank, honest way about your own personal views as it relates to equality, but specifically as it relates to marriage equality.” It was clear from Biden’s body language that the question made him uncomfortable. His public position was no different from the president’s. As a senator, Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act. As a presidential candidate himself, he said he supported civil unions. And as the vice president, he had studiously toed the administration’s shifting line. Biden stood up, flipped his bar stool around so that the back was between him and the rest of the guests and then straddled it. He looked almost pained, Griffin said.
magazine,“I look at those two beautiful kids,” Biden began. “I wish everybody could see this. All you got to do is look in the eyes of those kids. And no one can wonder, no one can wonder whether or not they are cared for and nurtured and loved and reinforced. And folks, what’s happening is, everybody is beginning to see it. “Things are changing so rapidly, it’s going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say, ‘I oppose gay marriage.’ Mark my words.” Having started down this road, he seemed incapable of stopping. People his children’s age could not understand why gay couples should not be allowed to marry, he said. “ ‘I mean, what’s the problem, Dad?’ “And my job — our job — is to keep this momentum rolling to the inevitable.” The answer stunned everyone in the room, even top aides who were used to the gaffe-prone vice president’s habit of going off script. “He’d been answering that question the same way for years,” one said. “But being in that house, seeing that couple with their kids, the switch flipped. It was like his hard drive got erased.” Sitting in his West Wing office more than a year and a half later, the vice president told me that he could still picture that day “like it was 10 minutes ago.”
magazine,“It was one of the most poignant questions I had ever been asked in my life,” Biden said. “It ranks up there with when this little girl in Afghanistan was looking at me about two weeks after the Taliban fell, and I was in Kabul, and she looked at me with those beautiful hazel eyes. And I said, ‘Well, I have to leave now.’ And she said: ‘You can’t. You can’t. America can’t leave. I want to be a doctor.’ ” Griffin was standing against the wall at the Los Angeles gathering, Biden recalled, when he looked at him and said, essentially, “ ‘Well, let me just ask you, Mr. Vice President, what do you think of us?’ And it was like, wow, whoa.” Biden said it reminded him of a summer afternoon when he was in his 20s. He was sitting on the beach in Delaware with his father and some friends when an older gay couple walked over to say hello. His father, a Realtor, had sold them their apartment in a building nearby. The elder Biden hugged both men and said, “Let me introduce you to my family.” One of the younger Biden’s buddies made a derogatory remark about the couple, and his father’s reaction to it stayed with him all these years. “He says: ‘As soon as they get in the apartment, you go up to the ninth floor. You walk up and knock on the door, and you apologize to them.’ ” When his friend refused, his father said, “Well, goddamn it, you’re not welcome in my house anymore.”
magazine,Biden then described another day, years later, when his own young son looked up at him quizzically after seeing two men headed off to work kiss each other goodbye on a busy street corner. “I said, ‘They love each other, honey,’ and that was it. So it was never anything that was a struggle in my mind.” The truth was, Biden said, other than being concerned as a Catholic that churches not be forced to perform ceremonies for gay couples, “I didn’t see a problem with it,” and he never had. “It wasn’t like I had an epiphany, as we Catholics say — one day, ‘Oh, my God, I guess there should be gay marriage.’ ” So when Griffin posed that question to him, in the privacy of that home in Los Angeles, Biden decided to say what he actually thought. Two weeks later, Biden sat down with David Gregory of “Meet the Press.” Gregory asked the vice president whether his outlook on same-sex marriage had changed. With the Los Angeles encounter fresh in his mind, Biden talked about the couple he recently met and the question he was asked, and then he gave pretty much the same answer. “What this is all about is a simple proposition,” he told Gregory. “Who do you love, and will you be loyal to the person you love? And that’s what people are finding out is what all marriages at their root are about.” “And you’re comfortable with same-sex marriage now?” Gregory pressed.
magazine,“I, I — look — I am vice president of the United States. The president sets the policy. I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying one another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties.” The interview, which took place on a Friday, was scheduled to be broadcast to the nation that Sunday. In the limousine back from the studio, Shailagh­ Murray, Biden’s communications director, worried as she replayed the interview in her head. Turning to Biden, she said, “I think you may have just gotten in front of the president on gay marriage.” Political commentators immediately began to speculate that Biden’s remarks were either intended as a trial balloon or had specifically been cleared by the White House to mollify gay voters without the president’s having to take a position. Neither was the case. When the White House press team received a transcript of the interview, tempers flared. Jarrett, who was still hoping that Obama might make a groundbreaking pre-election announcement, accused Biden through an intermediary of disloyalty. Campaign officials were also agitated. “They felt they already were vulnerable,” one White House official told me, “and they had not fully resolved yet what they wanted to do.”
magazine,The White House quickly tried to walk back Biden’s comments. “What VP said — that all married couples should have exactly the same legal rights — is precisely POTUS’s position,” Axelrod tweeted on Sunday, May 6, the day Biden’s interview aired. Biden’s office was told to put out a “clarification” echoing that sentiment: “The vice president was expressing that he too is evolving on the issue,” it said. Though the statements were greeted with outright disbelief by many gay activists, the episode nevertheless seemed “headed into the category of Joe Biden-isms, where the vice president accidentally speaks the truth,” one White House official said. “But then [Education Secretary] Arne Duncan was asked on Monday for his position and answered that he supported same-sex marriage. And then it was like, oh, they are going to ask every single cabinet member.” Griffin’s question had inadvertently set off a chain reaction. Obama and his team knew that he had to take a stand, soon, or risk looking as if he were “leading from behind,” a portrayal the White House hated. On Tuesday, the White House hastily offered Robin Roberts of “Good Morning America” an exclusive interview with the president the next day. She was a woman, as Mehlman had suggested, and the White House liked her conversational style. She was also African-American, which provided a chance to reach out to black voters.
magazine,Some of Obama’s top advisers urged him to take Biden to task for forcing his hand, but he refused. The first lady saw the whole thing as a blessing in disguise. The endless debate was over. You don’t have to dance around this issue anymore, she told her husband over breakfast on Wednesday, in a conversation she relayed afterward to several top White House officials. “Enjoy this day,” she said as he headed off for his interview. “You are free.” But sitting with Roberts in the White House Cabinet Room, Obama did not sound like a man who’d been liberated to say what he truly believed. Even as he made history, he offered what amounted to a carefully calibrated and incremental endorsement, one that had something for both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage. North Carolina had, as predicted, recently enshrined a ban on same-sex marriage into its State Constitution, becoming the 30th state to do so. Mindful of the voters there and in other swing states with similar bans, the president emphasized that he had no desire to “nationalize” what he called the “healthy debate” taking place across the country. “I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level, because historically this has not been a federal issue, what’s recognized as a marriage.” But as a personal matter, he said, he now believed that gay couples should be able to marry. He told Roberts that he would have “probably” endorsed same-sex marriage before the election, and that the vice president just “got out a little bit over his skis.”
magazine,In explaining how his thinking had “evolved,” he hit on many of the poll-tested talking points that Mehlman outlined in the memo he sent months earlier to Plouffe. He brought up Malia and Sasha, and talked about how “it doesn’t make sense to them” that the law treats gay parents of their friends differently from their own. He spoke of the need to respect religious liberty, but said that for him, as a practicing Christian, his faith was rooted “not only [in] Christ sacrificing himself on our behalf, but it’s also the golden rule.” He spoke about the “soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ is gone, because they’re not able to commit themselves in a marriage.” And he said that while he respected the views of those who disagreed with him, “I think it’s important to say that in this country, we’ve always been about fairness and treating everybody as equals. I actually think that, you know, it’s consistent with our best and in some cases our most conservative values, sort of the foundation of what made this country great.”
magazine,In the months after the announcement, the coalition that Obama needed to win a second term did not crumble. To the campaign’s surprise, Election Day exit polls showed that endorsing same-sex marriage did not hurt him among key constituencies — Catholics and Latinos, for instance, supported it. And the backing motivated Obama’s progressive base, including voters ages 18 to 30, who broke decisively his way. In addition, voters in three states for the first time approved ballot measures legalizing same-sex marriage, while those in a fourth voted down a ban. Mehlman was correct in predicting that it would do little to drive Republican turnout. As Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director at the time, put it: “It was the bomb that didn’t go off.” In his Inaugural Address on Jan. 21, 2013, Obama drew a straight line from the civil rights fights based on race and gender to the current struggle for marriage equality. “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law,” the president said, “for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.” Listening, Griffin grew emotional, sensing that, finally, history was bending toward his cause. Like the Federal District Court before it, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had struck down Proposition 8 as unconstitutional, and the appeal was scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court that March.
magazine,But Griffin’s optimism quickly gave way the next day when Charles J. Cooper, the Washington-based lawyer charged with defending the constitutionality of Proposition 8, filed an opening brief with the Supreme Court, citing the president’s interview with Robin Roberts to argue that bans like Proposition 8 were not motivated by impermissible prejudice. Cooper’s brief quoted Obama as saying that those who opposed same-sex marriage were not coming at it “from a meanspirited perspective,” and it used Obama’s “healthy debate” language to argue that this was a matter for voters and legislatures to decide, not the courts. Later, when Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, was asked whether Obama’s inaugural speech indicated a shift from his position that states should be left to chart their own course on marriage, he said it did not. Furious, Griffin fired off a sharply worded news release criticizing the statement. He also privately arranged for him and Boies to meet with Jarrett and Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel. Boies and Olson felt it was imperative that Obama take one final step in his evolution, by having his solicitor general file a brief with the Supreme Court clearly stating that the administration believed that bans like Proposition 8 were not just bad policy, but they also violated the Constitution.
magazine,In preparing for the White House meeting, Olson encouraged Boies and Griffin to emphasize the importance of the case to Obama’s legacy. But when Griffin asked his friend and former business partner Kristina Schake, who was now the first lady’s communications director, about that strategy, she discouraged it: The president is capable of assessing his legacy without your input, she told him. Focus on the law, she said, and why bringing in the solicitor general would make a difference legally. At the meeting, Boies did just that, discussing Obama’s inaugural speech in the context of their legal strategy. Now that Obama had said what he said, Boies argued, “silence would not be considered neutral.” It would, in fact, be deeply harmful, signaling that even someone as friendly to gay voters as Obama considered their argument a bridge too far. It could cost them the case. “It’s already being used against us,” Boies said, citing Cooper’s brief. Both women seemed impressed by their pleas. But before they left, Boies said, Jarrett made it clear that further lobbying via the press would not be helpful. This was now a legal decision, she said, not a political one.
magazine,It would have been unusual for the solicitor general’s office to file a brief in a case like Proposition 8 that did not involve a challenge to a federal law. But Olson had already met with Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the solicitor general, who is responsible for representing the federal government before the Supreme Court, and argued that it was not unprecedented. In the landmark Brown v. Board of Education, the solicitor general’s office filed a brief arguing that state segregation laws were unconstitutional. Olson insisted that there was no less a moral imperative in the Proposition 8 case. “This is one of those ‘What did Daddy do in the war?’ moments,” participants in the meeting recalled him saying. For Verrilli, the easiest course would have been to sit out the Proposition 8 case. His office had already filed a brief in the federal case on the Defense of Marriage Act, asking the Supreme Court to strike down the law. The justices could find DOMA unconstitutional without declaring a nationwide right for gay couples to marry. The remedy was relatively uncontroversial: Already-married couples would simply start receiving benefits. But if Verrilli simultaneously argued that gay couples had a fundamental right to marry, he would be pressing the court to strike down bans nationwide, which would complicate the administration’s DOMA strategy. In particular, if Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whom everyone presumed would cast the deciding vote in the DOMA case, became convinced that the only way he could strike down DOMA was to adopt a rule of law that would force every state in the nation to allow gay couples to wed, he might get cold feet. “We potentially run the risk of losing him,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. told me, reflecting on his concerns at the time.
magazine,But as he reviewed his options, Verrilli was struck by a memo Olson’s team had put together outlining the similarities between the arguments used more than a century ago defending bans on interracial marriage and those being used today opposing same-sex marriage. The supporters of Proposition 8 contended, for example, that allowing gay couples to wed could harm traditional marriages. The Alabama Supreme Court in 1877 opined that the state must “guard” against the “disturbances” that interracial marriage would produce. Defenders of Proposition 8 also argued that the impact of allowing gay couples to marry was unknown. The commonwealth made the same argument in Loving v. Virginia, which struck down a law prohibiting interracial marriage, saying the court should defer to the wisdom of the states given the “conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage.” It also mentioned the state’s interest in promoting an optimal child-rearing environment, an argument that Proposition 8 proponents were now making. Verrilli also turned to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” which responded to criticism by white clergymen that King’s demands were premature and ill timed. King’s words, about how you can fight a “degenerating sense of ‘nobodiness’ ” for only so long before “the cup of endurance runs over,” resonated. Verrilli studied suicide statistics that reflected the despair felt by many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender teenagers. When he was finished with his research, he shared his recommendation with Holder: Whatever the risk to the DOMA case, the government should take a stand on Proposition 8.
magazine,Holder agreed. In charting the administration’s course forward, he could not help thinking about the past. “The way a gay boy or young gay girl views themselves is similar, again, to the way African-Americans in 1953, ’52, saw themselves when they had to deal with this notion of ‘separate but equal,’ ” he told me. “Staying out was just not consistent with where we wanted to be tactically, legally or morally.” Holder and Verrilli then met with the president and Ruemmler, his White House counsel, and Denis McDonough, his chief of staff, for more than an hour in the Oval Office to go over the Justice Department’s recommendation. “This was not a briefing,” Holder recalled. “This was a meeting of equals in terms of knowledge of the facts, knowledge of the law.” The president did not need to be persuaded on the larger moral question; whatever he may have said in the past, he, too, saw the marriage debate through the prism of civil rights, according to Ruemmler and Holder. But Obama wanted to offer Kennedy and the rest of the justices an incremental way to decide the Proposition 8 case that would not force them to overturn bans across the country, a position that he worried the court would find untenable. They arrived at what they referred to as the “eight-state solution.” States needed a justification when they singled out a class of citizens for differential treatment. The plan was to file a brief with the Supreme Court arguing that in states that recognized same-sex domestic partnerships, it was particularly irrational to ban marriage because doing so could not be said to further any governmental interest. In addition to California, that argument would cover Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island. “By the time we leave” that meeting, Holder recalled, “we know what position we’re taking, what our strategy is.”
magazine,Shortly before the administration’s brief was filed at 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 28, Ruemmler called Griffin: When the two couples he recruited to challenge Proposition 8 stood before the justices, they would not be standing alone, she said. Standing with them would be the United States government. “The next time I see you will be at the Supreme Court,” she told him. Griffin had no way of knowing that in June, the justices would strike down a central part of DOMA while declining to decide the Proposition 8 case on the merits, effectively permitting same-sex marriages in California. But he did know that his chances had significantly improved. After hanging up with Ruemmler, he thought back to May 2009, the day he announced the Proposition 8 lawsuit at a news conference in Los Angeles. Afterward, he drove across town to an Obama fund-raiser. When it was his turn to shake the president’s hand, he used the opportunity to begin what would become his mission to win Obama’s support. “Mr. President, we just filed a case challenging the constitutionality of California’s ban on same-sex marriage,” he recalled saying. “We certainly hope you will be with us on this.” It had taken four years and a profound shift in public opinion, but the president was, at last, with them.

jobs,The Cosmetics Creator: Blending Art and Commerce - The New York Times Charlotte Tilbury, 42, is a beauty entrepreneur based in London. Q. Why did you start your own brand? A. I think it had a lot to do with a very bohemian upbringing in Ibiza: I went to Spanish school, then a hippie school where I was taught astrophysics by a man called Ra and my homework was telepathy. I was brought along to nightclubs at the age of 8 while Grace Jones or James Brown played sets, and danced with glamorous adults who gave me more than passing conversation because they were on holiday. That sort of childhood meant I learned from a young age to rely heavily on intuition. What did you do before starting your company? Early on I took a job assisting the makeup artist Mary Greenwell. I then spent the next 15 years working my way up the ranks and traveling the world doing the makeup for everyone from Vogue to W to Dazed & Confused magazine. I also spent a lot of time in Hollywood doing red carpet work. But one of the most fulfilling parts of my work was creating makeup lines. I was creative director at Helena Rubinstein for a while and created products for the big fashion houses. I did lipsticks for Armani and Alexander McQueen. I also created the first cosmetics line for Tom Ford. Any tips for creative types who want to start their own business? 
jobs,Get a great lawyer. And don’t be afraid to ask questions. Business might be intimidating, but it is not rocket science. Don’t define yourself as a creative mind or a commercial mind — you can be both, and limiting yourself to either is a huge reason for failure. Would you ever consider the Charlotte Tilbury brand being part of a big beauty conglomerate like L’Oréal or Estée Lauder? I’m not going to answer that question.  How do you maintain balance?  Homeopathic drops and vitamins — I am a devotee of both. Also making sacrifices. I am a mother, an artist, a business owner and a friend, and there are only ever so many hours in the day. But don’t always let it be your social life that takes the hit. I’m a firm believer that a drink and a dance let off steam, clear your mind and give you more clarity when you go back to work.
business,A Hacker May Have Entered Egghead Site - The New York Times Egghead.com Inc., an Internet retailer of computers, electronics and sporting goods, with 3.62 million registered users, said today that customer credit card data might have been stolen by a hacker earlier this week. Egghead.com asked the F.B.I. to investigate and said it notified credit card companies as a precautionary step. More detailed information about what occurred and how the security breach was discovered should be available next week, a company spokeswoman, Shoreen Maghame, said. Credit card companies are notifying card issuers and banks to ensure the security of cardholders, Egghead.com said. The company also hired Kroll Associates to advise on security and analyze the break-in. ''We're trying to be as forthright as we can and take the necessary  precautions,'' Ms. Maghame said. The company will notify customers by e-mail, she said. Egghead.com, which was formed through the merger of a namesake company and Onsale Inc., had 2.04 million visitors to its sites in November, said Media Metrix, a company that tracks Web site use. Last week the F.B.I. said it was looking for a hacker who stole more than 55,000 credit card numbers from Creditcards.com and posted some of the information after the company ignored a demand for $100,000.
world/middleeast,Nusra Front Says Drone Killed a Senior Leader in Syria - The New York Times
world/asia,Pakistan Vote Inspires Measured Optimism in India - The New York Times NEW DELHI — The bitter and sometimes violent rivalry between India and Pakistan shows no signs of abating, but many in New Delhi greeted Sunday’s election results in Pakistan with measured optimism on Monday. Nawaz Sharif, who is poised to become the next prime minister of Pakistan, has often said he would like to improve ties with India. Indians who closely follow diplomatic developments believe that Mr. Sharif will have to reach out to his giant neighbor if he hopes to turn Pakistan’s moribund economy around and improve vital services like electricity generation. But analysts in India disagree about whether Pakistan’s powerful military and intelligence services are likely to allow Mr. Sharif to make lasting peace with India. K.C. Singh, a former counterterrorism coordinator and former Indian ambassador to Iran, said the greatest danger to progress may lie in Mr. Sharif’s making an overture before he has a solid hold on his country’s powerful security infrastructure. “The risk is that he will go too fast, and the military will undertake a strike against India and set everything back,” Mr. Singh said. “Sharif has a lot of work to do before he can fundamentally change the relationship with India.” Lalit Mansingh, a former Indian foreign secretary and former ambassador to the United States, said he was pleased with Mr. Sharif’s victory, even though he did not expect any rapid changes. “Looking at the range of candidates in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif was definitely our best bet,” he said.
world/asia,Relations between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a militant group based in Pakistan carried out terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, killing 164 people. Pakistan initially denied that any of its citizens had taken part in the attacks, and the country has done little to prosecute those who helped plan it. A result has been a long cold spell with India. But Pakistan’s growing problems with its militant groups, including the Taliban, suggest to many in India that the sword Pakistan had hoped to use against India now threatens Pakistan as well. The hope here is that Pakistani leaders will conclude that all terrorist groups must be eliminated, even those whose mission is to attack India. “I’m guardedly optimistic,” said Gopalaswami Parthasarathy, a former Indian ambassador to Pakistan. Mr. Parthasarathy said that neither government had had the will or the credibility to attempt an ambitious reset of relations. India’s government is hindered by corruption scandals and a slowing economy, while Mr. Sharif faces the need to tame his generals, he said. Even so, incremental progress is possible on economic cooperation, eased visa restrictions and some power deals, he said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India congratulated Mr. Sharif on his victory Sunday. “The people of India also welcome your publicly articulated commitment to a relationship between India and Pakistan that is defined by peace, friendship and cooperation,” he wrote. An editorial in The Hindustan Times on Monday stated that “India has genuine reason to be pleased” with the results of Pakistan’s election.
world/asia,“India should not expect a Kashmir settlement or the arrest of Hafiz Saeed in a few months’ time,” the editorial stated, referring to a leader of a militant group linked to multiple terrorist attacks in India. “What it can hope for is a government,” it continued, “that will understand that cutting dependence on the United States and China is only possible if Pakistan has a modus vivendi with India.” Still, some in India were dismissive of the idea that Mr. Sharif or any elected politician in Pakistan could change the decades of animosity between the nuclear-armed neighbors. “I’ve always believed it’s ultimately the generals who decide on Pakistan’s security policies,” said Vivek Katju, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan. “And they have not changed.”
sports/baseball,Nationals Stir Memories of Washington Senators, but Not Passion - The New York Times At the house where my parents live in Washington, there was a telltale sign of summer in the late 1960s and early ’70s: two dirt patches interrupted the lawn behind the tall magnolia that leaned like the Tower of Pisa in the middle of our backyard. Those oval spots of ground, a makeshift pitcher’s mound and home plate, grew while the season progressed for our Washington Senators as my twin, Paul, and I imitated our favorite players and wore out the grass. (Actually, progressed is probably the wrong word, given our team’s propensity to hang near the basement of the American League.) This is not a tale about glory days. It’s a story about one D.C. boy’s love for a wanting baseball club and how, once that team — the second incarnation of the Senators — was taken away just after he turned 10, he could never generate any passion for another baseball team or even maintain it for the game itself. Now, as the nation’s capital enjoys the anticipation of postseason baseball for the first time since 1933, I find myself happy for the city where I grew up but unable to truly share in the excitement. No doubt I’ll watch on television if the Nationals, who arrived in 2005 as D.C.’s third version of a big-league baseball team, go all the way. But for me, all this talk of winning streaks and Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper and whatnot has merely rekindled memories of a long-gone obsession.
sports/baseball,My Senators left Washington in 1971, taken by the owner, a Midwestern Walter O’Malley named Robert Earl Short, to become the Texas Rangers. It was a move that left D.C. without a baseball team for more than 33 years. I left the Washington region nearly two decades ago, and I’ve lived in New York City for 14 years. Still, small signs of my once important attachment linger in my Manhattan apartment. In a cardboard box in a closet rest hundreds of baseball cards (nearly all with their latest statistics from 1969), rarely touched, like bugs in amber. On several occasions, I’ve replaced the rubber bands that hold the players together by team; the originals have broken. The largest pile is for the Senators, who were led by Ted Williams as manager in the last three years of their undistinguished 11-season stay in Washington. Del Unser. Tim Cullen. Paul Casanova. They’re all here. But I display only one baseball player’s card in a clear plastic holder on a bookshelf. He is Frank Howard, a k a Hondo, whose towering presence and seemingly effortless display of power inspired many a D.C. youngster to swing a bat. I had such little concept of age at the time that I thought he was in his 60s; No. 33 was really in his early 30s. One of my favorite Senators-related possessions: a copy of The Washington Post from July 24, 1969, the day the men who first walked on the moon were due to splash down in the Pacific Ocean.
sports/baseball,“Apollo on Perfect Path to Earth,” bleats the banner headline at the top of the front page. Immediately below is a large color picture of Hondo slamming a home run in the All-Star Game, held that year in D.C. (The National League still won the game.) The idea of frolicking in a spacesuit on the Sea of Tranquillity was so beyond the realm of possibility for a youngster — but, perchance, to be like Hondo, the Capital Punisher, and just once swat a ball 450 feet into the center-field mezzanine. Anyway, 1969 was about when Paul and I started paying attention to the Senators, an expansion team that replaced the first Senators club (which became the Minnesota Twins after the 1960 season) and started playing at the old Griffith Stadium in 1961, the year we were born. The next year, they moved to District of Columbia Stadium, which was renamed Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in 1969. As for our backyard ballpark, it never changed much. We played with a tennis ball rather than a hardball to limit the potential damage to our neighbors’ homes. The magnolia did a pretty good job of blocking ours from disaster, though I recall a football once got the best of our kitchen window. Paul, who is left-handed, was more likely to hit the ball over the right-field fence into the Wallaces’ yard, and my shots tended to plunk down in the Perrigins’. More often, the ball would slam into the magnolia, ruffling its emerald leaves and sometimes sending a fragrant bloom down to earth.
sports/baseball,Occasionally, we’d choke up on the bat like Ed Brinkman, the shortstop; sometimes, we tried to act like Hondo, the 6-foot-7 god of a left fielder who seemed to handle the wood as matter-of-factly as a schoolkid would a No. 2 pencil. The Senators, who finished with the worst record in baseball in 1968, made history of sorts in 1969. It was the only winning season for the club in its 1961-1971 stint in D.C. But let’s keep things in perspective: they still finished fourth — or third from the bottom — in the newly created American League East. (In the Senators’ final two seasons, they finished last and second to last.) But we weren’t into history and statistics. Maybe if our team had stayed longer, we would have become more sophisticated. We just wanted to watch and play baseball. I didn’t even know who Walter Johnson, the legendary pitcher who helped the original Senators win their only World Series, in 1924, was until a few years later, and then only because a friend owned a baseball he had signed. Paul and I watched baseball on television when we could and often listened on a little red transistor radio in our room when night games extended beyond our bedtime. We attended only a few games at R.F.K. Purely by coincidence, I’m sure, the Senators won each time we attended.
sports/baseball,I remember seeing the great slugger Harmon Killebrew, who had followed the first incarnation of the Senators to Minnesota, when we hosted the Twins, and I recall Rod Carew’s hitting a foul ball that struck a woman in the stands along the third-base line. Hondo didn’t hammer any homers during the games we attended. One of the trips we took to R.F.K. with our parents was for Camera Day, when fans were allowed onto the field before the game to take pictures with the players. By the time we got out there, left field was mobbed with people trying to get as close as they could to Hondo. But my father managed to get pictures of Paul and me with a couple of players, including Dick Billings, a catcher and outfielder. I remember the anger when official word came in September 1971 that Short, who bought the team in 1968, planned to move the Senators to Arlington, Tex. I vaguely recall that someone carried an effigy of Short through the stands at R.F.K. during one of the final games (it turns out the culprit was an usher), and I listened to the last game on that red transistor exactly 41 years ago — on Sept. 30, 1971. The next morning, I was jealous when a couple of the kids on our school bus who had been at the stadium recounted the game and the mayhem that ensued. Hondo had homered, and the Senators were leading the Yankees, 7-5, with two outs in the top of the ninth, but they had to forfeit the game after fans poured onto the field, stole bases and ran amok. In what The Post called “the final irony,” the fans had lost the game for the team.
sports/baseball,My interest in baseball did not wane immediately. We certainly played backyard ball for a few more seasons, and I managed to participate briefly in some lame baseball in junior high school. Yet I never adopted the nearby Baltimore Orioles, a shift that many of my friends made effortlessly. This broke the momentum of my interest in baseball. I occasionally went to games at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore — and, later, Camden Yards — with friends, but I never considered myself a fan. Don’t get me wrong: I can enjoy a good game and a great baseball moment as well as anyone. In 2000, I felt almost giddy during the first game of the Subway World Series. I’ve accompanied a friend who’s a die-hard Mets fan to opening day a few times and watched Tom Seaver throw out the first ball. I was even at Yankee Stadium recently when Derek Jeter passed Willie Mays on the career hits list. But I lack the passion of a true fan. When word came several years ago that, after years of teases, Washington was finally getting another professional baseball team (the Montreal Expos), I couldn’t believe it. In 2005, I visited R.F.K. with Paul, my father and a high school friend. I was somewhat wistful. I don’t remember who won, and I have yet to attend a game at Nationals Park, which opened in 2008.
sports/baseball,In recent years, any spark of interest that baseball has given me has led me to revisit my past allegiance rather than develop a new one. A few years ago, I bought a baseball that Frank Howard had signed and inscribed as the 1960 N.L. Rookie of the Year. (He was with the Los Angeles Dodgers then.) I also bought a bat that he had signed as the A.L. home run king in 1968 and 1970. My brother, who also did not adopt the Orioles, has an easy explanation for my lack of excitement about the Nationals. “You’re not here, Pete,” said Paul, who still lives in D.C., attended the Nationals’ home opener in 2005 and goes to 8 to 10 games a year. “It’s a great story,” he said, after going on about the lackluster sports teams in Washington over the last couple of decades. “Lo and behold, it’s turned into something special.” At my parents’ home, the magnolia in the backyard long ago succumbed to age and weather, the lawn is uninterrupted, and the neighbors’ homes are safe from fly balls. But in Manhattan, a cardboard box that continues to travel with me still contains the treasured remnants of a D.C. boy’s childhood love, now more than four decades dead.
sports/football,Andrew Luck and Peyton Manning Practice, but Won’t Start - The New York Times Colts quarterback Andrew Luck returned to practice Wednesday but was ruled out of Indianapolis’s critical game Sunday against the Houston Texans. Coach Chuck Pagano said he was optimistic that Matt Hasselbeck would start against Houston despite missing Wednesday’s practice. Hasselbeck, 40, is still dealing with rib and neck injuries, but the Colts’ third-string quarterback, Charlie Whitehurst, has been with the team for only five weeks. Luck, recovering from a lacerated kidney and a partly torn abdominal muscle, will miss his fifth straight game, his seventh this season and his second in a row against Houston (6-7), which is tied with Indianapolis atop the A.F.C. South. Hasselbeck won his first four starts this season as Luck’s replacement, but has lost his last two. Sunday’s game will be a battle of backup quarterbacks. Houston Coach Bill O’Brien said that his starter, Brian Hoyer, would sit out after his second concussion in less than a month and that the Texans would turn to T. J. Yates. MANNING BACK ON FIELD The Broncos’ Peyton Manning returned to practice for the first time in 32 days, but not to his starting job. Brock Osweiler will make his fifth straight start at quarterback when Denver plays at Pittsburgh on Sunday. He is 3-1 in place of Manning, who has a torn plantar fascia in his left foot.
sports/football,VIKINGS HURTING ON DEFENSE Minnesota held three defensive starters out of practice — defensive tackle Linval Joseph (foot), linebacker Anthony Barr (groin and hand) and defensive end Everson Griffen (shoulder) — and listed eight defensive players in all, including five starters, on its injury report. SEAHAWKS’ CHANCELLOR SITS Seattle strong safety Kam Chancellor missed practice with a tailbone injury sustained in Sunday’s win over Baltimore. Cornerback DeShawn Shead (ankle) and defensive end Michael Bennett (toe) also sat out. The Seahawks signed running back Christine Michael to bolster an offensive backfield thinned by injuries to Marshawn Lynch and Thomas Rawls. RAMS CORNERBACK SET TO PLAY Cornerback Janoris Jenkins is expected to be in the Rams’ lineup for their game against the Buccaneers on Thursday night. Jenkins was a full participant in practice after being cleared from the N.F.L.’s concussion protocol, Coach Jeff Fisher said.
nyregion,Touches of Whimsy at World Trade Center’s Liberty Park - The New York Times “This is one of the most beautiful garages in the world,” Steven Plate said about the 25-foot-high structure that leads into and out of the underground vehicle security center at the World Trade Center. Mr. Plate has an interest in saying so, since he is the chief of major capital projects at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is redeveloping the trade center site. But he also has a point. Offhand, it is hard to imagine another garage in New York City with 19 planters on a publicly accessible roof, many with recycled teak seating set into their sharply angled concrete walls; a 336-foot-long vertical garden planted with a half-dozen species; a panoramic view of the National September 11 Memorial; a sapling propagated from the horse chestnut tree that Anne Frank could see outside her window in Amsterdam; and a Greek Orthodox shrine designed by Santiago Calatrava. Taken together, these features are called Liberty Park. The one-acre, $50 million park, elevated on Liberty Street, is to be dedicated on Wednesday. After that, it will be open to the public from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day, said Glenn P. Guzi, a program director at the Port Authority. It is sure to become a popular destination, particularly when a half-dozen young honey locusts and other trees mature into a dappled canopy over an exposed, hard-edged expanse.
nyregion,An overlook running more than 200 feet along Liberty Street offers a splendid view of the memorial from an intimate perspective, along with the calming sound of the waterfalls at the south memorial pool and welcome puffs of river breeze. (Welcome in summer, at least.) Along Greenwich Street, the park affords the best people-watching spot in Lower Manhattan: a cascade of tiered teak seating reminiscent of the TKTS staircase north of Times Square or even, in a modest and more comfortable way, the steps at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The elevated park can also be reached by gently inclined ramps. Look closely and you will even find touches of whimsy, not a characteristic that springs to mind when talking about the Port Authority. Some of the teak seating around the planters tapers down to planks only a few inches tall — as if they had been set aside for the comfort of visiting hamsters. The design is by Joseph E. Brown, a landscape architect and the former chief innovation officer at Aecom, a giant architectural and engineering company. The most unusual feature of Mr. Brown’s design is a vertical garden along Liberty Street. It wraps around the bays where trucks are cleared to serve the buildings of the trade center along a network of underground roadways and loading docks.
nyregion,This “living wall,” by Plant Connection of Riverhead, N.Y., is composed of 826 panels filled with goldenstar, Baltic ivy, Japanese spurge, common periwinkle, coral bells and winter creeper, forming broad bands of color. The panels are cultivated in a horizontal position at the nursery, then shifted upright as the plants’ roots become anchored to the soil and the panels’ structure. Irrigation tubes punctured with tiny weep holes snake among the panels to keep the plants watered. The park project was intended partly to compensate the residential neighborhood south of the trade center for the 15 years of construction, disruption, dislocation and trauma it has suffered since the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. “We wanted to give a gift back to the community,” Mr. Plate said. The elevated park serves as a setting for the St. Nicholas National Shrine, designed by Mr. Calatrava, which is now starting to assume recognizable form in concrete. It is also the new location of the “America’s Response Monument,” a sculpture by Douwe Blumberg of one of the Special Forces soldiers on horseback in the early years of the war in Afghanistan. “America’s Response Monument,” subtitled “De Oppresso Liber,” a motto of the Special Forces, has been treated far more deferentially in recent years than Fritz Koenig’s “Sphere,” a sculpture that actually stood in the original World Trade Center plaza and survived the 2001 attack — symbolizing both loss and resilience. Mr. Koenig’s work was all but banished to Battery Park by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
nyregion,When asked whether the installation of “America’s Response Monument” in Liberty Park foreclosed the return of the “Sphere” to the trade center site, Mr. Plate answered cryptically, “I didn’t say that.” “The Koenig ‘Sphere’ is very special to the Port Authority,” he said. “We have thoughts as to how it could be accommodated in this facility; for our neighbors, for the families and for history.”
sports/baseball,How a Mets Coach Brought Out Daniel Murphy’s Power - The New York Times Kevin Long had heard all about Daniel Murphy. When the Mets named Long their hitting coach last fall, he knew that Murphy was a highly intelligent hitter, but also stubborn. Long knew he would have to prove himself worthy of his new pupil’s attention. Honors students can tune out a teacher they do not respect. “When you talk to Daniel Murphy, you better make sense and you better be able to explain yourself and explain the benefits of why it will help,” Long said. “Otherwise you will lose him.” As Long spoke on Friday at Citi Field, he wore a hooded sweatshirt with the logo of the 2015 World Series. So it is safe to say he did not lose Murphy. The Mets rode Murphy’s bat — and the pinpoint command of their rotation — to their fifth National League pennant. Murphy is batting .421 in the postseason, with seven home runs and 11 runs batted in. His slugging percentage, with the sample so small but the stakes so great, is 1.026. The best single-season slugging percentage in major league history is .863, by Barry Bonds in 2001, when he hit 73 home runs. “I wish I could explain it,” Murphy said in Chicago on the way to winning the Most Valuable Player Award for the N.L. Championship Series. “I would have done it, like, six years ago.”
sports/baseball,Murphy then thanked Long and his assistant, Pat Roessler, for their work in helping him. Long, on Friday, gave Murphy credit for seeking to improve the way he has. Many of the Mets’ hitters reached out to Long last off-season, and some, like David Wright and Curtis Granderson, visited him in person before spring training. But only Murphy asked Long for a detailed breakdown of his plan to make him better. Long was in Hawaii when he got Murphy’s message in January. He sent Murphy his thoughts and said he paced nervously around his uncle’s pool, unsure how Murphy would react. “He could have said, ‘Oh, God, who does this person think he is?’ ” said Long, who hit .273 in an eight-year minor league career. “And I don’t want to be that guy. But I have to do what’s best for the player.” The best thing for Murphy, Long believed, was to hit for more power. Murphy had made his first All-Star team in 2014 but finished the season with just nine home runs. He was a .290 career hitter, but it was a soft .290. What if Murphy could keep his best trait — his ability to make contact, like Robinson Cano — but do so with a different mind-set? Players around the league knew Murphy could hit, but he kept his power hidden, displaying it mainly in batting practice.
sports/baseball,“Seeing him from the other dugout, it’s obvious this guy can put the ball in play,” said Kelly Johnson, the well-traveled infielder who joined the Mets in July. “He’s a tough guy to strike out, he’s got a great eye and he was going to make solid contact. “Since I’ve been here, I’ve seen this guy in B.P. hit balls as far as anybody, as consistently as anybody. The power and pop is there and I’m thinking, This guy’s got a lot more power than people realize.” Long believed Murphy should harness that power by driving more with his legs, moving closer to the plate, getting his front foot down sooner and bringing his hands lower and closer to his body. Just five minutes after he shared those thoughts with Murphy, Long said, he got this reply: “Right on.” At the Mets’ workout Saturday, Murphy said he had spent his career feeling as if he were late in getting to the ball. Long’s advice, especially about his front foot, made sense. “I was like, this guy’s talking my language, because he’s right,” Murphy said. But applying the changes took time. Through April 25, Murphy was hitting .145 with one homer. From that point on, he hit .300 with 13 homers. The home run output was rather ordinary, but from Aug. 1 through the end of the regular season, Murphy’s slugging percentage was .533. “He always says: ‘I’m not hunting hits anymore. I’m hunting to do damage,’ ” Long said. “And there’s a big difference.”
sports/baseball,Before the postseason, Murphy’s most significant improvement came in his existing area of strength. He struck out only 38 times in 499 at-bats, a major league-best 13.1 at-bats for every strikeout. Felix Millan was the last Met to lead the majors in that category, in 1975. He played every game and hit one home run. Murphy did it with respectable regular-season power that preceded extraordinary October power. His surge is the payoff for believing in Long’s suggestions. “I always tell guys you’ve got to go backward before you go forward,” Long said. “That’s why you have to trust what you’re doing and kind of sell it. If you stick to it, it will turn, because you see it in B.P.” Often, Long said, Murphy will take his practice in the indoor batting cage instead of on the field, the way Jason Giambi did with the Yankees. The fear is that hitting on the field, with the fences so inviting, can lead to a bigger, loopier swing. Inside, Murphy can work on smaller, more precise adjustments. Few spend as much time in the cage as Murphy, or seem to enjoy it as much. In Chicago, Manager Terry Collins spoke of the first time he met Murphy, when Collins was the Mets’ minor league field coordinator in 2010. Murphy missed the season with a knee injury, but Collins would find him in Port St. Lucie, Fla., watching a rookie-league game in the morning and a Class A game at night.
sports/baseball,“There are people in our game who do this because this is what they can do best, and if they could do something else, they might — because of the pressures, and the time, and the effort, and being banged up,” Collins said. “Dan Murphy is a baseball player.” From a baseball lifer like Collins or Long, there is no higher compliment. For a baseball player like Murphy, there is no higher stratosphere than the one he is reaching now.
sports/olympics,Twins Finish Marathon Hand in Hand, but Their Country Says They Crossed a Line - The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO — The Olympics are as much about what warms the heart or initiates debate as who wins the medals. But what warms the heart or initiates debate can be a matter of perspective in a sprawling event that brings together more than 200 nations and territories. There was little division on Tuesday in the Olympic Stadium, when two runners — Abbey D’Agostino of the United States and Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand — offered a helping hand to each other after a collision in the 5,000 meters and then urged each other on to the finish. “I mean, that girl is the Olympic spirit right there,” Hamblin said afterward, speaking to reporters about D’Agostino. But on Sunday in the women’s marathon, when the German twins and training partners Anna and Lisa Hahner decided — spontaneously, they insist — to join hands as they crossed the finish line deep in the pack and far from the medals, they quickly drew sharp criticism. German track and field officials accused them of publicity seeking and treating the Olympic marathon “like a fun run.” This is not just a German point of view, of course, but it does reflect the range of expectations as athletes navigate the cultural norms that relate to competition and sportsmanship.
sports/olympics,The Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby, who refused to shake the hand of his Israeli opponent Or Sasson, was following his nation’s standards — one that Olympic officials expressly reject. He was ejected from the Games. There was no outcry, only amusement, when David Katoatau, an exuberant weight lifter from Kiribati, danced off stage on Monday with the goal of heightening awareness of the threat posed by climate change to his tiny nation in the central Pacific Ocean. The Hahner twins had no political agenda when they joined hands to end their race, but their move, to their surprise, was still polarizing. “Victory and medals are not the only goal,” Thomas Kurschilgen, sports director of the German Athletics Federation, said in an email on Tuesday. “Still, every athlete in the Olympic competitions should be motivated to demonstrate his or her best performance and aim for the best possible result.” That approach, according to Kurschilgen, is what divides elite sport from mass-participation sport and what he thinks the Hahners failed to grasp. “Their main aim was to generate media attention,” he said. “That is what we criticize.” The twins, who placed 81st and 82nd in the marathon, do not see it that way. Contacted on Monday, they initially declined to speak, but Anna Hahner later sent an email in which she said they had not planned on finishing hand-in-hand and had done their best individually. “In all the marathons we ran together before, there was a point in the race we had to split up,” Anna said. “This was also the case in the Olympic marathon.”
sports/olympics,Anna said she started faster, and then Lisa’s group caught up with her at around the 17-kilometer mark, at which point Anna said they ran about three kilometers together. “But then I realized I couldn’t run this pace, and I had to let them go,” Anna said. “Lisa was always not far from me. After 40 kilometers, there was a turning point, and I knew, ‘Okay Anna, two kilometers to go to close the gap to Lisa.’ I invested all I had and 300 meters before the finish line, I was next to Lisa. It was a magical moment that we could finish this marathon together. We did not think about what we were doing.” But Anna said the symbolism was not lost on either twin. “We trained the last four years to participate in this marathon,” she said. “Neither the time nor the position was what made us happy but to know that we did the best that was possible that day.” And yet the sisters were well short of their best marathon performances. Anna’s personal best in the marathon is 2 hours 26 minutes 44 seconds. Lisa’s is 2:28.39. In Rio, Anna finished in 2:45.32, and Lisa in 2:45.33 despite coming early to the Olympic city to acclimatize. Clearly, the large time gap between their previous performances and their Olympic performances made Kurschilgen and others only more convinced that they were not seeing the twins’ best effort.
sports/olympics,There is a school of thought at the Olympics and elsewhere that it can be better for an athlete’s profile and even their bottom line to lose memorably — however unintentionally — than to win routinely. D’Agostino and Hamblin would not have become global talking points on Tuesday if they had simply collided and soldiered on without interacting. Nor would the British runner Derek Redmond have become part of an “Olympic moment” if he had simply won his 400 semifinal at the 1992 Olympics instead of tearing his hamstring and insisting on continuing the race. His father came onto the track to assist him as he hobbled to the finish with the Barcelona crowd cheering him on. Even though Redmond was disqualified for receiving outside aid, the image and the memory were and remain powerful. It is the unexpected and uncalculated gesture that so often moves the masses most, no matter what the culture. “This is Olympism,” said Mary Wittenberg, former director of the New York City Marathon who has attended many Olympics. “Yes, athletes go as hard as they can to win the shiniest medals they can most of the time. We love that, and we want to see those medal dreams come true. That said, there are moments when it’s not all about that and most often, as in the case of the Hahners, it’s also because that’s not in the cards at a given event. So an athlete makes a conscious decision to make the most of the moment in a different way.”
sports/olympics,It is worth noting that the Hahners were not the only twins to finish side by side on Sunday. Kim Hye-song and Kim Hye-gyong of North Korea finished 10th and 11th on Sunday in an identical time of 2:28.36. No word from North Korea whether this was perceived officially or unofficially as an uncompetitive act.

obituaries,Russell Markert, 91, the Founder And the Director of the Rockettes - The New York Times Russell Markert, the founder and longtime director of the Rockettes, died on Saturday at Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. He was 91 years old and lived in Heritage Village in Southbury, Conn. From the opening of Radio City Music Hall in Rockefeller Center in 1932 until Mr. Markert's retirement in 1971, he was the chief choreographer, image-preserver and resident father-figure of the famous troupe of tall, svelte women. In the era when the Music Hall played to full houses every day of the year, he trained and rehearsed 2,500 Rockettes, young women who had to be 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall, with pretty faces and shapely figures who were adept in ballet, tap and soft shoe and able to kick at least 6 inches over their heads. Besides "exceptionally limber kicks," Mr. Markert said in 1967, he also required applicants to have a background in modern jazz, the ability to pick up new steps quickly and a personality that not only projected from the stage, but also merged into the ensemble.  Intuitive Mathematics A Rockettes routine usually originated in a dramatic concept or an evocative piece of music. Mr. Markert and an associate director then worked out the floor patterns and step combinations, relying on what he described as a kind of intuitive mathematics.
obituaries,The ensemble produced such film stars as Vera-Ellen and Lucille Bremer and has had an indelible impact on the halftime activities of several generations of American sports events. Mr. Markert's posts at the Music Hall also included producer and vice president. His 90th birthday was honored last year by more than 400 people -- Rockettes, former Rockettes and friends -- at the Sheraton Centre Hotel in mid-Manhattan for the benefit of the Russell Markert Dance Scholarship at the Juilliard School.  In Military Shows The innovative and effervescent choreographer was born on Aug. 8, 1899, in Jersey City, where he attended public schools and began to study dance. In World War I, he served in the Army Quartermaster Corps in France and, in his free time, performed in military shows. Mr. Markert began his professional career on Broadway, graduated from the chorus to dance director of the annual revue "Earl Carroll's Vanities" and, in St. Louis in 1925, founded a women's precision troupe called the Missouri Rockets. While playing in Manhattan, the group was spotted by the impresario S. L. (Roxy) Rothafel, who headlined them at the Roxy Theater as "The Roxyettes." They moved to the Music Hall for its 1932 opening and soon became the Rockettes. In 1937, the troupe appeared at the Paris International Exposition, competed with Europe's leading dance companies and walked off with the grand prize. Mr. Markert leaves no immediate survivors.
business/dealbook,Morgan Stanley to Pay $3.2 Billion Over Flawed Mortgage Bonds - The New York Times Morgan Stanley will pay $3.2 billion to strike a settlement with state and federal authorities over the Wall Street firm’s creation of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Nearly a year ago, Morgan Stanley announced that it expected to pay $2.6 billion to federal authorities in the settlement. Since then, though, Morgan Stanley was pushed to offer more money. Much of the additional money will go to New York State. The settlement, which was announced Thursday morning, is one of the last that is expected to come out of a working group that President Obama helped form in 2012 to deal with the flawed mortgaged-backed bonds that banks put together before the financial crisis. In the go-go years that preceded the crisis, Wall Street banks purchased subprime mortgages and packaged them into bonds that ended up suffering significant losses. Because Morgan Stanley did not originate mortgages itself, its settlement is much smaller than those struck by large consumer banks like Bank of America, which paid $16.6 billion in its 2014 settlement. Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that it had set aside legal reserves to cover the agreement and would not take any additional charges in its coming financial results. “We are pleased to have finalized these settlements involving legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters,” a spokesman for the firm, Mark Lake, said in a statement.
business/dealbook,Morgan Stanley relied on a few subprime mortgage originators, especially New Century, to feed its bond pipeline. In the settlement this week, Morgan Stanley agreed to a statement of fact that includes revealing details about its relationship with New Century. The statement says that Morgan Stanley employees frequently tried to increase the “pull-through rate” of New Century loans getting into securities, even when the loans were lower quality than expected. In thousands of cases, Morgan Stanley included loans that were worth more than the value of the underlying property – something it had told investors it would not do, according to the settlement. Emails cited in the document suggest that Morgan Stanley employees knew that they were bending the rules to include riskier loans. “Please do not mention the ‘slightly higher risk tolerance’ in these communications,” one employee said in an email quoted in the statement. “We are running under the radar and do not want to document these types of things.” Morgan Stanley’s close ties to New Century were previously put on public display in a lawsuit filed against the bank by the American Civil Liberties Union. The acting United States attorney in San Francisco, Brian J. Stretch, said on Thursday that “Morgan Stanley knew that in reality, many of the loans backing its securities were toxic. Abuses in the mortgage-backed securities industry such as these helped bring about the most devastating financial crisis in our lifetime. “
business/dealbook,As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley will pay $150 million in cash to New York State, and another $400 million in consumer relief, according to the office of the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. It is paying another $22.5 million to the State of Illinois. Previously, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $1.25 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency and $275 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle investigations involving similar issues. In total, Morgan Stanley has paid about $5 billion to members of the residential mortgage-backed securities working group. The agreement struck this week leaves Goldman Sachs as the last of the big Wall Street banks not to have completed its settlement with the federal working group. Goldman said last month that it expected its settlement to cost up to $5 billion.

upshot,Prediction Markets Score the Debate a Rout: Clinton Over Trump - The New York Times According to the people who put money on the line in the political prediction markets, Hillary Clinton clearly won the first debate. Here’s why the markets are a useful scorekeeper. When the final bell rings and the pugilists return to their handlers, you turn to the refs to see who won, only to discover there’s no way to score the fight. Post-debate commentary doesn’t work for the same reason Spin Alley isn’t insightful — it’s dominated by partisans cheerleading their favorite candidate. But prediction markets have a way of ferreting out people’s real beliefs, because they back those beliefs with their own money. I watched Monday evening’s debate in split-screen, tracking movements in political prediction markets as the two candidates went back and forth. During the 90 minutes of the debate, nearly $1 million was traded on the prediction market at BetFair.com. Bettors liked what they saw from Mrs. Clinton. The first major shift in the odds occurred within the first half-hour, and the odds of a Clinton presidency continued to rise as the debate went on. At no point did the markets move in Donald J. Trump’s favor. When he boasted of his temperament, the audience laughed, and the market tilted further against him. All told, Mrs. Clinton’s odds of winning the election rose from around 63 percent in the minutes before the debate started to 69 percent by the end. Likewise, Mr. Trump’s chances of winning the White House declined by five percentage points. Other prediction markets, such as PredictIt, showed an even larger move against Mr. Trump.
upshot,The value of the dollar relative to the Mexican peso — which has come to be the financial price most closely associated with Mr. Trump’s electoral fortunes — also fell sharply during the debate, perhaps a sign that traders don’t believe that Mr. Trump will get a chance to raise trade barriers with Mexico. I have been watching these markets for years, and it is highly unusual to see such a large shift. After all, many factors beyond the debates are relevant to the November election. Many of these factors — such as the candidates, their positions, the state of the economy and even their way with words — are already baked into the prediction market prices. Sure, debates historically have not shifted public opinion much, and so this large move may well prove to be an overreaction. These changing prediction market prices don’t directly reflect who was more persuasive, but rather which candidate most exceeded expectations. Traders were already aware of the relative eloquence of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump before the debate. This means that the change in a prediction market price tells you how much each candidate overshot or undershot those expectations. And so it would have been possible for Mrs. Clinton to have made her case more eloquently than Mr. Trump, but if traders had already expected it, the markets wouldn’t have moved. So my interpretation is that Mrs. Clinton did more — she beat expectations about how she would perform. Or alternatively, Mr. Trump did less, significantly undershooting expectations of a more presidential performance, and thus hurting his chances of winning the White House.
upshot,‘A National Admissions Office’ for Low-Income Strivers - The New York Times Arianna Trickey was opening a piece of mail in her bedroom during junior year of high school when a pamphlet fell out of the envelope. The pamphlet seemed to offer the impossible: the prospect of a full scholarship to several of her dream colleges. She went running out to her father, a house painter, who was sitting on the family’s porch in Grass Valley, a California city in the Sierra Nevada foothills. “You have to see this,” she told him. “This is the scholarship that will get me to the best schools in the country.” The pamphlet was from a nonprofit organization called QuestBridge, which has quietly become one of the biggest players in elite-college admissions. Almost 300 undergraduates at Stanford this year, or 4 percent of the student body, came through QuestBridge. The share at Amherst is 11 percent, and it’s 9 percent at Pomona. At Yale, the admissions office has changed its application to make it more like QuestBridge’s. Founded by a married couple in Northern California — she an entrepreneur, he a doctor-turned-medical-investor — QuestBridge has figured out how to convince thousands of high-achieving, low-income students that they really can attend a top college. “It’s like a national admissions office,” said Catharine Bond Hill, the president of Vassar.
upshot,The growth of QuestBridge has broader lessons for higher education — and for closing the yawning achievement gap between rich and poor teenagers. That gap is one of the biggest reasons that moving up the economic ladder is so hard in the United States today, as I’ve written before. But QuestBridge’s efforts are innovative enough to deserve their own attention. In addition to the hundreds of its students on college campuses today, hundreds more have graduated over the last decade. They’ve gone on to become professors, teachers, business people, doctors and many other things. Ms. Trickey, a senior at the University of Virginia who is also getting a master’s in education, plans to become an elementary-school teacher in a low-income area. College admissions officers attribute the organization’s success to the simplicity of its approach to students. It avoids mind-numbingly complex talk of financial-aid forms and formulas that scare away so many low-income families (and frustrate so many middle-income families, like my own when I was applying to college). QuestBridge instead gives students a simple message: If you get in, you can go. Yet the broader lessons of QuestBridge aren’t only about how to communicate with students. They’re also how our society spends the limited resource that is financial aid.
upshot,The group’s founders, Michael and Ana Rowena McCullough, are now turning their attention to the estimated $3 billion in outside scholarships, from local Rotary Clubs, corporations and other groups, that are awarded every year to high school seniors. The McCulloughs see this money as a wasted opportunity, saying it comes too late to affect whether and where students go to college. It doesn’t help the many high-achieving, low-income strivers who don’t apply to top colleges — and often don’t graduate from any college. “Any private scholarship given at the end of senior year is intrinsically disconnected from the college application process,” Dr. McCullough said, “and it doesn’t have to be.” They plan to offer prizes in some cases to high school juniors, like a summer program or a free laptop, to persuade them to apply. To win the prize, the junior would need to fill out a detailed application, which could become the basis for his or her college application. The idea draws on social science research, which has shown that people often respond better to tangible, short-term incentives (a free laptop) than to complicated, longer-term ones (a college degree, which will improve your life and which you can afford). Two pilot programs started with donors — one focused on New Yorkers, one on low-income Jewish students — have had encouraging results, the McCulloughs say. QuestBridge has its roots in summer programs they started as Stanford students in the 1980s and 1990s. The initial one helped Dr. McCullough, who had paid his own way through Stanford, win a Rhodes scholarship.
upshot,The programs tried to lift the ambitions of talented teenagers from modest backgrounds, by introducing them to peers and to successful adults. “The combination of seeing what can be done and then having someone you respect telling you you can do it — I think that’s what most young people need,” said Nico Slate, who attended a program in 1996. A native of a small town in the Mojave Desert, he is now a history professor at Carnegie Mellon and studies social movements in India and the United States. Eventually, the McCulloughs realized the growing applicant pool to their summer program consisted of exactly the students whom top colleges said they wanted to recruit. So the couple began approaching admissions officers with plans for a new program the colleges would help pay for. QuestBridge uses traditional databases, like those with SAT scores, as well as networks of high school teachers and others to recruit students. It has an early application deadline, in late September, and a long application form, designed to get students to tell the story of their lives. Crucially, the program promises a scholarship not just for one year but for four. As Mrs. McCullough, the organization’s chief executive, said, “Unless you make that kind of promise to the students and their parents, they’re going to worry, ‘Will the schools really pay for all four years?’ ”
upshot,Colleges balked at the promise at first. “What if we commit to a full scholarship and then the mom wins the lottery?” as Thomas Parker, the retired admissions dean at Amherst and an early QuestBridge supporter, put it. But he said the McCulloughs were persistent, arguing that many students would skip applying if they thought the scholarship might go away in later years, and college officials ultimately agreed. The winners of the scholarships — which colleges pay for, as they do for much of QuestBridge’s budget — go through a matching process. They attend their first choice among any of the 35 participating colleges that admit them. Hundreds of scholarship finalists who don’t win are admitted separately to the colleges, through a more typical admissions process, often with nearly full scholarships. The students form a support network for one another, they say. “It completely changed my life,” Ms. Trickey told me, while sitting on the balcony of her apartment in Charlottesville, Va., which she called the nicest place she’d ever lived. When she was growing up in California and her father could not find enough painting work, her family would volunteer at a food bank, partly so they could eat the leftover food at the end of the evening. As much as QuestBridge has grown, it of course remains tiny relative to the population of college-ready, low-income teenagers. Only a small slice of them will attend colleges with the resources to offer full scholarships. That’s why the larger lessons of QuestBridge are so important.
upshot,What are they? One, the complexity of the financial-aid process is scaring students away from college. “You don’t even know what it’s talking about half the time,” Mr. Parker said of the federal form. The Obama administration has taken steps to simplify it, but a full revamping would require help from Congress. Two, large amounts of well-meaning scholarship money — from private sources as well as from Washington and state governments — is fairly ineffectual. It helps many students who would graduate from college regardless, rather than those with the skills to graduate who are at risk of not doing so. Three, not every problem created by inequality is fiendishly difficult to solve. Yes, many of them are, from growing gaps in health and family structure to struggling public K-12 schools. Yet some gritty teenagers, like Ms. Trickey and Mr. Slate, still figure out a way to emerge from high school with stunning résumés. They’re on track to become quintessentially American success stories — and far too many of them still end up falling short.

fashion,A Fashion Tech Giant Makes a Commitment to London - The New York Times LONDON — In the last two decades, London has forged a reputation as the technology capital of Europe and as a global capital of the fashion technology sector — a competitor to New York and Silicon Valley, where creative, commercial and digital talent thrives in a single cosmopolitan place. Some of the biggest names in the fashion industry, especially in e-commerce — such as Asos, Farfetch, Lyst and Yoox Net-a-Porter — have headquarters in the British capital. But in the wake of Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union, a development that raised the possibility of an immigration crackdown, a drop in foreign investment and economic uncertainty, London’s high-ranking position has come into question. Taavet Hinrikus, the Estonian co-founder of the money-transfer company TransferWise, which says it has a valuation of more than $1 billion — has told The Guardian that his company is unlikely to continue hiring at its London headquarters. Peter Smith, chief executive of the financial technology company Blockchain, said  this month that many non-British tech entrepreneurs in London were “deeply offended” by the British government’s stance on immigration since the vote. And while the fashion community has stayed relatively silent on the subject, there is little doubt that businesses have been mulling their options as European capitals on the Continent position themselves as worthy alternatives. Venture capital investments in Britain plummeted 40 percent in the second quarter this year compared with the first quarter, as uncertainty before the vote held investors back, according to data published this week by CB Insights.
fashion,Given that climate, an announcement this week from the Yoox Net-a-Porter Group about plans to centralize  its Britain-based technology operations in the BBC’s former headquarters in West London has been a welcome vote of confidence. Yoox Net-a-Porter, a British-Italian company, said on Monday that it planned to accommodate about 600 staff members in its new technology hub by March, taking two floors — about 70,000 square feet of state-of-the-art (and expensive) office space — in the new MediaWorks building at White City Place. That represents a 20 percent increase in the size of the group’s technology team, which the company says will have as many as 1,000 employees in Britain and Italy. Although a majority of London’s technology headquarters are in the east of the city, Alex Alexander, chief information officer of Yoox Net-a-Porter, said the company wished to stay in the west to be close to its other operational base, above the Westfield shopping center. Other big names in the local creative sphere said to be setting up offices in the White City development include the fashion label Stella McCartney and the Royal College of Art. “We were keen to show our commitment to the U.K.,” Mr. Alexander said by telephone from New York, “and felt that bringing all of our technology talent into a single hub was an important step in terms of bringing our five-year plan, which is based on outpacing our competition on mobile, to fruition.”
fashion,He brushed off suggestions that London’s reputation had been tarnished by the country’s decision to leave the European Union. “We continue to have real confidence in London, regardless of the decision to leave the E.U., and see this investment as an opportunity to reaffirm that,” Mr. Alexander said. “We don’t see any side effects in terms of talent being drawn here. We are expecting to see a steady flow continue and think the city will remain a world-leading tech hub.” Fashion companies are not alone in doubling down on the British capital. Facebook and Google, among other American tech giants, also have plans to expand their London operations, investing in development and sales teams to fuel their European activities. Predictably, signs of major technology and fashion companies taking steps to expand its presence in London was met with open arms. “I am delighted that there will be yet more new tech jobs coming to the capital,” said Rajesh Agrawal, London’s deputy mayor for business and enterprise. “This highlights once again that London is open for business, new investment and global talent.” For now, the signs for Britain are encouraging. Of Europe’s technology unicorns — private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion — almost 40 percent are based in the country. Nearly a third of all European venture capital funding comes to Britain.
fashion,But it is still early. There is no certainty that Europeans working in Britain will be forced to leave once the withdrawal from the bloc is final, and a report by Balderton Capital shows that while engineers in Berlin or Paris earned on average almost 18 percent less than their London counterparts do, the devaluation of the pound was fast closing that gap. Whether entrepreneurs looking to start the next billion-dollar fashion technology business might favor Berlin, Dublin or Stockholm — which have established technology sectors and benefit from the European Union’s free flow of labor — remains to be seen.
style,ON THE STREET; Rising Trends - The New York Times It's an old cliché that when hems go up, so does the stock market. So Wall Street, rejoice: with a few adventuresome women sporting the refreshing look of a long stretch of exposed leg, the miniskirt shows signs of a revival. In the early 1970's, the mini saved the fashion world from the debacle of the mid-calf lengths championed by the press, designers and store buyers. Customers of all ages rejected that dowdy look for the youthful short skirts, as many women believe the legs are the last to go.
technology/personaltech,Video Feature: Apple Watch Apps That Are Available Now - The New York Times AT its recent annual developer conference, Apple made a move to jump-start the production of apps for the Apple Watch by announcing a software tool kit that will enable developers to create more advanced programs for the new device. But while we wait — this software upgrade isn’t set to arrive until this fall — the Apple Watch has around 3,500 apps that users can experiment with. Many of the apps showcase the capabilities of the device, such as displaying notifications and augmenting the abilities of a smartphone app. While these apps have not turned the Apple Watch into a must-have device for all users, I tested programs that were great at monitoring fitness and the weather, and one that was even useful for booking a hotel room, among others. One of these memorable Watch apps is Carrot Fit, a seven-minute workout app that encourages you to repeatedly jump, crunch and do other exercises by mixing sarcasm, humor, jesting insults and cartoon graphics. Instead of having to glance at your smartphone screen to know how long to repeat a particular exercise and which one to do next, you can see this information on your wrist with Carrot’s app. The app uses a clearly visible timer disc and gives an animated view of the movements you are doing. You can start and pause workouts and get feedback on your performance. This $3 fitness app is less boring than its rivals, and more motivating.
technology/personaltech,Notifying users of approaching bad weather is another task perfectly fit for the Apple Watch. Dark Sky is an example of this type of app, which features graphics and one useful trick: It can alert you if rain or snow is imminent where you are. Weather alerts may also be more noticeable on the Apple Watch than on a smartphone because of the attention-grabbing buzz on your wrist. Dark Sky for the watch shows a basic breakdown of the day’s weather forecast — which is shown with clear numbers, text and simple graphics — as well as the forecast for the next five days. The app costs $4 and works only in the United States, Britain and Ireland. Clear is a popular to-do list app that makes planning fun, thanks to its slick gesture-based interface and appealing graphics. On the Apple Watch version of Clear, which costs $5, some of this finesse is lost because of the small screen, but much of the app’s power and ease of use remain intact. You can view all of your to-do lists, easily mark items as “done” with a tap (great for shopping), sort your list entries and add entries via speech recognition. You can also add alerts, which will then buzz your wrist according to when they are scheduled. These reminders can be seen in the watch’s Glances page for easy viewing.
technology/personaltech,Using Shazam, a free music discovery app, on your phone to recognize a piece of music you are listening to has always felt high-tech. But previously you would have needed to take your phone out, unlock it and open Shazam — running the risk that the tune you are listening to will end. Shazam on the Apple Watch will start when you tap the app on the watch face. The app, which is free, processes the sounds around you and identifies music automatically. If the album art is available, you can see it on the watch screen, and track the song name and artist name, as well as the lyrics in some cases. Hotel Tonight for the watch, much like its phone-based counterpart, provides a list of nearby hotels that have rooms available that night. The watch app will list the same nearby hotels and will show you the hotel’s price, luxury level, distance from your location and a small photo. Tapping on an entry reveals more information, including a location on a map. With the app, which is free, you can book a room right from your wrist. Try Trivia Crack and Camera Plus on Apple Watch. Trivia Crack, which costs $3, lets you play a general-knowledge quiz game on your wrist. While its interface is fiddly, it provides essentially the same fun experience as the full phone app.
technology/personaltech,Camera Plus is a neat app that allows you to see your phone’s camera view on your watch screen, and then snap a photo or take a video via the front or back cameras of your phone. It is great for taking selfies, but you need to run Camera Plus on your phone at the same time. The app costs $2.  Quick Call  The PBS app has long been popular on iOS.

us,Opposition to Judge in Stanford Sexual Assault Case Grows, In and Out of Court - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — A California judge who was criticized for handing down a short jail term in a case involving a sexual assault at Stanford University is facing a growing number of impediments both inside and outside the courtroom. Since Judge Aaron Persky of Santa Clara Superior Court sentenced a former champion swimmer for Stanford, Brock Turner, to what is effectively a three-month jail term, a dozen jurors have objected to serving in his courtroom. He was also the subject of a successful motion on Tuesday by the district attorney’s office to stop him from presiding over another sexual assault case. And since he handed down the sentence, a petition to remove him from the bench has attracted 1.4 million supporters, its organizers say. Judge Persky’s sentence in the Turner case gained national prominence when the victim released a powerful statement that she had made during the sentencing to BuzzFeed. The statement, which has been read millions of times online, describes her personal anguish during the assault and the trial. The case that Judge Persky was removed from on Tuesday involved a male nurse accused of touching, without any medical reason, the genitals of a sedated female patient. In the motion to remove Judge Persky, the prosecution said he was “prejudiced against the party or the interests of the party,” said Stacey Capps, the chief trial deputy in the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office. The prosecution was unable to have a “a fair and impartial trial or hearing” with Judge Persky hearing the case, the motion said.
us,In an interview, Ms. Capps said such motions were made “with some regularity” in the court, but usually by the defense. The motions are rarely opposed. Jeffrey F. Rosen, the Santa Clara district attorney, said in a statement Tuesday that he had lost confidence in the judge to try the case. The statement also cited another case that Judge Persky dismissed on Monday before a jury could deliberate. In that case, the police stopped a woman in a stolen car and found what they said were stolen items in her bag. Jury selection in the case had been more difficult than usual, with as many as 16 jurors refusing to serve because they said they were unsettled by Judge Persky’s sentence in the Stanford sexual assault case. “I’ve never seen a juror tell a judge, I can’t be fair because of the judge,” said James Leonard, the supervising deputy district attorney. “It was shocking.” In his statement, Mr. Rosen said he was “disappointed and puzzled” that the theft case had been dismissed. “After this and the recent turn of events, we lack confidence that Judge Persky can fairly participate in this upcoming hearing in which a male nurse sexually assaulted an anesthetized female patient,” Mr. Rosen said. The prosecutor called the motion to dismiss Judge Persky “a rare and carefully considered step.” Mr. Rosen also said, “In the future, we will evaluate each case on its own merits and decide if we should use our legal right to ask for another judge in order to protect public safety and pursue justice.”
us,Judge Persky faces an election in November but is running uncontested. A Stanford law professor, Michele Dauber, has led the campaign to remove Judge Persky from office. Ms. Dauber, who helped release the victim’s statement to the media, is also a friend of hers. In Washington, on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, 18 members of Congress took turns reading the statement. The reading was part of an effort to gain support for legislation that would single out universities that do not properly address campus assaults, said Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, who organized the reading.
us,Pope Departs, After Showing a Deft Touch - The New York Times PHILADELPHIA — Six days ago, Pope Francis landed in Washington for his first visit to the United States — a country that he did not know and that did not know him. He flew out Sunday night, having wowed Washington and New York, while leaving behind a downtown Philadelphia transformed into a “Francisville” of pilgrims, families and hawkers selling Francis swag. The Argentine pope, at 78, after enduring an exhausting schedule, seemed to have had fun, too. “Please know that as I prepare to leave, I do so with a heart filled with gratitude and hope,” Francis said at Philadelphia International Airport before departing. Popes historically have done well during visits to the United States. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI, a far less charismatic figure, filled Yankee Stadium and drew large crowds elsewhere. Few people doubted Francis, the first Latin American pope, would connect with the masses. The question was how he would navigate a uniquely American minefield of political and religious divisions — as well as an outspoken faction of conservative Catholics deeply suspicious of him. He had his stumbles, especially when he lavished praise on bishops for their handling of the American sexual abuse crisis before finally meeting victims on Sunday morning. But mostly Francis demonstrated a nuanced political dexterity, effectively sidestepping the familiar framework of American debate while charting his own broader path. He advocated “life” but emphasized opposition to the death penalty, not abortion. He made strong stands for religious freedom — a major issue for American bishops — but refocused the concept on interfaith tolerance and harmony.
us,“I was frankly taken aback at how savvy he was,” said Stephen Schneck, the director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America. “He was clearly aware of all the very divisive issues for Catholics in American public life but talked about them in a way that didn’t give ammunition to either conservatives or progressives in the United States to use in their political wars.” With nearly every issue, he addressed American politics in his own pastoral terms. Tacking more left than right, he made vigorous calls at the White House, Congress and the United Nations for action to protect the earth against environmental destruction and climate change. He continued his advocacy for the needs of the poor. And he made a passionate and personal plea on behalf of immigrants from his native Latin America. “Like those who came here before you, you bring many gifts to your new nation,” Francis told the many Hispanic families attending an outdoor rally at Independence Hall. He added, “By contributing your gifts, you will not only find your place here, you will help to renew society from within.” The success of the trip is doubly important for Francis, because he returns to the Vatican for what could become a showdown between liberal and conservative factions in the Roman Catholic Church over doctrine and social teaching. Beginning on Sunday, Francis is convening a synod of bishops to hash out how the church should approach issues such as homosexuality and divorce — a meeting that loomed over his interactions with American clergy.
us,Bishops in the United States have been outspoken, arguing against same-sex marriage, and nondiscrimination laws that would require Catholic institutions and businesses to serve gay couples. Some bishops have forced Catholic schools in their dioceses to dismiss openly gay teachers or required them to sign doctrinal oaths. And at their most recent meeting, the bishops agreed that their top priorities are promoting respect for life and marriage — by which they mean teaching against abortion and same-sex marriage. Francis responded on this trip by advising the bishops to use less harsh language, be less critical and offer a more welcoming approach in the church and in society. “Our common house can no longer tolerate sterile divisions,” he said Sunday during his final Mass, on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. He never mentioned same-sex marriage — and is opposed to it — but analysts say his message was that bishops should focus less on such issues and more on pastoring to Catholic families over all. “The pope said church leaders need a conversion in the way that they approach modern families,” said John Thavis, an American church analyst and author of “The Vatican Diaries.” “He laid it on the line, saying less complaining and more appreciation. He calls it a realistic approach.” Mr. Thavis added, “I think the message is that the church has to work in the real world, with real families, instead of expecting families to meet the ideal definition, or measure up to church teaching.”
us,Many conservatives were pleased that Francis emphasized religious liberty; some found meaning in his glance toward President Obama when he raised the issue at the White House. Others praised the pope’s unscheduled visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns suing the federal government over the contraception mandate in the health care act. But many were disappointed that Francis endorsed Mr. Obama’s environmental agenda and failed to mention abortion, doctor-assisted suicide or same-sex marriage. While Francis needed to be careful wading into politics, “complete silence on these issues demoralizes those who are on the front lines of these battles,” wrote R. R. Reno, the editor of First Things, a conservative journal on religion in public life. “The only specific issues Francis mentioned before Congress are associated with progressive politics.” For Francis, largely avoiding the political minefield allowed him to pursue what many analysts say was his primary agenda as bishop of Rome: to present a new, more optimistic and welcoming style to American Catholics, and to embrace and encourage a domestic Catholic church that is increasingly Hispanic and populated by new immigrants. He avoided issues such as a border wall or a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, yet he made clear that immigration is central to his identity and America’s ideals.
us,When he was taken into a helicopter above New York, he asked the pilot to circle the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island — symbols of freedom and immigration. When the 5-year-old daughter of Mexican immigrants broke through security at the Ellipse in Washington, Francis ordered guards to bring her over so he could offer a kiss. He also introduced himself at the White House as a son of immigrants. “When you talk about leaders — his words are reaching those who have not been heard,” said Maria Rodriguez, 65, a member of a Hispanic Catholic Charismatic movement, who came with 120 others to Philadelphia from Orlando, Fla. “For the Spanish-speaking people, he’s our voice. And when he speaks, people listen.” From the outset of his papacy, Francis has reached out to the poor, casting himself as the humble pope through word and gestures. In the United States, he ended many of his speeches by asking the audience to “pray for me, don’t forget” — a jocular admonition in accented English. And he insisted on traveling in a small Fiat, an advertising coup for the Italian carmaker, which led to endless images of him waving out the open window to adoring crowds snapping photos with cellphones.
us,He kissed babies. He halted his Fiat to embrace a disabled boy. He met with prisoners and leaders of other faiths at the Sept. 11 memorial, told New Yorkers struggling with inequality and isolation that “God is living in our cities,” and prayed with the homeless in Washington after canonizing a saint for the first time on American soil. (On Sunday, the police in California said vandals had defaced the mission where the remains of the new saint, the Rev. Junípero Serra, are buried, splattering paint on walls, a statue, a fountain and a crucifix.) Francis’ most emotional speech came Saturday night as he stood before hundreds of thousands of families from around the world, who had gathered for the World Meeting of Families. Smiling, gesticulating like an energetic grandfather, he tossed aside his script and told a simple story of love and creation that would have been impossible with the usual doctrinal footnotes. A day later, Linda Giovinco, 66, of Linfield, Pa., was walking toward the exits after Francis’ final Mass. The enormous crowd was thinning, and Francis was already on his way to the airport. “I love the inclusiveness of this pope,” she said. “He stepped outside the borders of what’s been acceptable before in the Catholic Church.” While everyone in the church if not the country was parsing what Francis said during his visit, the faithful, including Ms. Giovinco, heard unmitigated tolerance. “He’s following the original precepts of the church: Love one another.”
us,California Sues Justice Dept. Over Funding for Sanctuary Cities - The New York Times Intensifying California’s standoff with the Trump administration over immigration policy, the California attorney general sued the Justice Department on Monday over the administration’s plans to cut off millions of dollars in federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities unless they begin cooperating with federal immigration agents. The state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, argued in the lawsuit that the Justice Department’s threat, made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month, undermines public safety and violates the Constitution. “It’s a low blow to our men and women who wear the badge for the federal government to threaten their crime-fighting resources in order to force them to do the work of the federal government,” Mr. Becerra said at a news conference. “We’re in the best position to determine how best to enforce the law and keep our people safe.” Mr. Becerra’s suit is the latest in a barrage of legal challenges in California and elsewhere over President Trump’s efforts to compel cooperation from local governments on immigration policy. Chicago sued the Justice Department over the same federal grants last week, and San Francisco quietly filed a matching complaint on Friday. It was San Francisco’s second time suing the Trump administration over the issue. In a previous skirmish, San Francisco and Santa Clara County won a nationwide injunction in April against Mr. Trump’s January executive order on immigration, which directed his administration to deny billions of dollars in funding to sanctuary cities. Similar lawsuits have come out of Richmond, Calif., and Seattle.
us,But while Mr. Trump’s executive order carried an undefined, if sweeping, threat, Mr. Sessions’s announcement last month was bluntly concrete: If local governments wanted the Justice Department’s money, they had to agree to allow federal immigration agents to interview immigrants at their jails and to give federal authorities 48 hours’ notice before releasing anyone with potential immigration violations. Taken together, those conditions would allow immigration agents to pick up unauthorized immigrants directly from local authorities, turning jails into pipelines for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Without access to local jails, federal authorities use other tactics to find their targets — often raiding immigrants’ homes or showing up at locations like local courthouses. Mr. Sessions has accused officials in sanctuary cities of shielding dangerous criminals from immigration agents. “Several California cities, including San Francisco, have already experienced the devastating effects that sanctuary policies have on their citizens,” a Justice Department spokesman, Devin O’Malley, said on Monday. “Given the multiple high-profile incidents that have occurred in California in recent years, it is especially disappointing that state leaders would take steps to limit cooperation between local jurisdictions and immigration authorities that are trying to keep Californians safe.” Officials in sanctuary cities, however, argue that their communities are safer when immigrants trust local authorities enough to report crimes and serve as witnesses without fear of deportation. Local law enforcement agencies have also faced lawsuits for holding inmates for federal immigration authorities.
us,The San Francisco and California lawsuits say that by tying the grant funding to immigration matters, the Justice Department is exceeding the constitutional authority of the executive branch. Only Congress can set such conditions, they say. Squeezed by the Justice Department, several local officials have already contacted Mr. Becerra’s office seeking guidance on how to respond before the Sept. 5 deadline for applying for new grants, he said. “It’s pretty clear that this is another attempt to accomplish what they were unsuccessful in accomplishing with the sanctuary city executive order,” the San Francisco city attorney, Dennis Herrera, said at the news conference. He added, “Our police and deputies are focused on fighting crime, not breaking up hard-working families.” The money in question, from the Justice Department’s Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, dispensed more than $260 million to states and cities in 2016. California and its local jurisdictions are scheduled to receive a total of $28.3 million next year, Mr. Becerra said. San Francisco, which could lose about $1.4 million if the new terms of the grant are enforced, uses the money for diversion programs that focus on treating and rehabilitating defendants, services for young people at risk of committing crimes, drug deterrence and other initiatives.
us,Four Charged in Shooting of Minneapolis Protesters - The New York Times MINNEAPOLIS —  A white man accused of shooting five Black Lives Matter protesters in Minneapolis apparently had racist views and identified with the antigovernment “sovereign citizen” movement, according to criminal complaints filed Monday charging him in the shooting. Three others were charged with related crimes. The man, Allen L. Scarsella, 23, fired all eight shots on Nov. 23 with a .45-caliber handgun, but his companions were also armed when they went to the demonstration, intending to set off a confrontation, the documents said. That night, they said, Mr. Scarsella admitted the shooting to at least three other people, who were not at the protest. At a brief news conference, Michael O. Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said Mr. Scarsella “has more than incriminated himself” in the shooting, which wounded five black men, ranging in age from 19 to 43. He said he did not believe any of the defendants were part of an organized racist group. On Mr. Scarsella’s cellphone were “racist images,” Kelly O’Rourke, a Minneapolis police sergeant, wrote in the complaint, without elaborating on what those images were. He also wrote that there were many photographs of Mr. Scarsella posing with guns and text messages among the defendants about plans to “rile up” and “stir up” the demonstrations on Nov. 23.
us,One of the people Mr. Scarsella confessed to the night of the shooting, a police officer he knows in Mankato, Minn., said Mr. Scarsella “had very intense opinions,” Sergeant O’Rourke wrote, and “had negative experiences with and opinions about African-Americans.” He viewed himself as a sovereign citizen, one of a group of people who refuse to recognize government authority in many spheres, particularly taxation. Prosecutors charged him with five counts of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon causing substantial bodily harm, each punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000. All four men were charged with second-degree riot while armed with a dangerous weapon, punishable by up to five years and $10,000. The others charged were Nathan W. Gustavsson, 21, and Joseph M. Backman, 27, both described as white, and Daniel T. Macey, 26, described as Asian-American. A state district judge in Minneapolis, Amy Dawson, set bail at $250,000 for each of them, and at $500,000 for Mr. Scarsella. When asked why he did not charge the men with hate crimes, Mr. Freeman said the charges he filed carried stiffer sentences. He said he was consulting with federal prosecutors about the possibility of filing federal charges, too. Black Lives Matter protests have been held in Minneapolis since the fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, 24, a black man, by a white police officer on Nov. 15.
us,On Nov. 19, Mr. Scarsella and a friend went to the protest, where they were seen on surveillance video wearing masks. On the way to the demonstration, the complaint stated, they shot video of themselves making derogatory references to black people and saying they planned to “make the fire rise.” Investigators interviewed the friend — who was not named and who did not accompany Mr. Scarsella the night of the shooting — and he said they took video of the protest and “made inappropriate comments to protesters which sparked anger,” and then posted angry comments on the websites Reddit and 4Chan, Sergeant O’Rourke wrote. The complaint said that on the night of the shooting, Mr. Scarsella admitted to the shooting in phone calls to the same friend, to his girlfriend and to an acquaintance who is a police officer. Todd Miller, director of public safety in Mankato, confirmed that it was an officer who worked in that city, Brett Levin, and that Mr. Levin informed a supervisor, who called the Minneapolis police. All four defendants were arrested the day after the shooting. The complaint says all have admitted, in jailhouse phone calls, that they were there when it happened.
business,A Lament for Saab, a Quirky Car Loved by Some - The New York Times The ignition was in the floor. It had a rear hatchback, not a trunk. The hood was hinged at the front, so it opened away from the windshield. And many of its owners — including Jerry Seinfeld’s character on his long-running sitcom — were intensely loyal. Auto enthusiasts across the country were dismayed by the news Friday that General Motors was planning to shut down Saab, the Swedish carmaker it bought two decades ago, after a deal to sell it fell apart. Even with its modest and steadily declining sales, Saab long stood out as a powerful brand in spite of itself. “It wasn’t designed to be a fashion statement,” said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, which tracks industry statistics. “It was designed to provide transportation under miserable weather conditions.” But in the process, Saab became a statement of its own. The American competition had floaty rides and Japanese cars were tight on space. By contrast, a Saab had taut steering, requiring drivers to actively guide the car as it powered through ice and snow. Priced several thousand dollars above Japanese rivals, Saabs featured front-wheel drive and turbo-charged engines, and many were sold with manual transmissions. Saab sales were always strongest in the Northeast, home for a time to the company’s American headquarters in Connecticut. Many Saab owners consider the brand’s glory days to be the 1980s, when Americans began buying cars again after a recession and energy crisis.
business,Mr. Pinelli, who was selling Volvos at the time, said he admired his Swedish rival. “The cars were communicative,” he said. “They didn’t try to numb the experience like cars do today.” The cars had odd touches. Swedish engineers assumed drivers would be wearing gloves, so they designed big buttons for the dashboard, Mr. Pinelli said. Though the cars were compact, with long hoods and short rear ends, there was plenty of headroom inside. “They were quirky; they were strange,” said Ray Wert III, editor in chief of Jalopnik.com, a Web site for auto enthusiasts. American sales for Saab peaked at 48,250 in 1986, when it added the larger Saab 9000 to a lineup focused on its bread and butter car, the Saab 900. Saab, as well as Volvo, gained a yuppie following, leading the Detroit car companies, which were eager to win over younger consumers, to buy them. The Ford Motor Company acquired Volvo in 1999. G.M. bought half of Saab in 1990 and took management control after Saab’s auto business was split from Scania, the Swedish maker of big trucks. G.M. took full ownership in 2000. Rather than preserve its Swedish underpinnings, however, G.M. made Saab part of a strategy to share engineering with the rest of its operations. It expanded the lineup, building Saabs from the same platforms as Opels, Chevrolets and Buicks, and it even enlisted Subaru of Japan to produce some cars.
business,The strategy led to a sales revival of sorts from the late 1990s, when Mr. Seinfeld drove a black 1996 Saab 900 SE convertible on his show, until the middle of this decade, with sales helped by rebates and inexpensive lease deals. The blanket approach “seemed to make sense to General Motors,” Mr. Wert said. “Unfortunately, it killed what made Saab Saab.” Saab sales plummeted in 2008 when it became clear that G.M. was looking to cut Saab loose. Saab sold fewer than 22,000 cars in the United States last year and has managed sales of just 7,812 in all of 2009 — fewer than Buick alone sold last month. Now Saab, a brand that once had one of the clearest identities in the industry, seems headed for extinction just as automakers are searching for more distinctive designs to help set them apart. “It’s a shame that Saab is a victim,” Mr. Pinelli said.
sports/basketball,For Better or Worse, These Knicks Belong to Phil Jackson - The New York Times GREENBURGH, N.Y. — When Phil Jackson agreed to preside over the Knicks in March 2014, he hoped to reshape the team into a championship contender. In the 557 days since, the Knicks have won 27 games — including 17 games last season, when they steamrollered franchise records for futility. On Friday, ahead of the start of training camp next week at West Point, Jackson sat under a tent outside the team’s training complex and reminisced about how much the roster had changed since his first day on the job. “I’m trying to remember,” he said. “How many guys do we have from that original group?” He came up with one name: Carmelo Anthony. So while the Knicks might be an improved product this season — it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to be worse — they will at least look different. That alone could be considered a victory on the cusp of the 2015-16 season. “This does feel like a group,” Jackson said, “that’s kind of been handpicked.” Jackson was joined at a morning news conference by General Manager Steve Mills and Coach Derek Fisher, each of whom praised the team’s work ethic — an early theme. Fisher showed up with a full beard, a summer project of sorts. Jackson said he liked Fisher’s new look. “Looks rough,” he said. “He’s going to look mean at those referees when they make a bad call.”
sports/basketball,Before the start of last season, Jackson famously predicted that the Knicks were bound for the playoffs. He turned out to be wrong. On Friday, he delivered a different message. “I want to stay away from expectations,” he said. “It’s such a long season.” If Jackson’s tone was different — more muted, more restrained — the pressure on him nonetheless seemed sure to mount. No longer is the roster littered with holdovers from a previous administration. Amar’e Stoudemire? Released. J. R. Smith? Traded. Andrea Bargnani? Banished to Brooklyn. Instead, Jackson has acquired players like Robin Lopez, Arron Afflalo and Kristaps Porzingis. This is Jackson’s team, for better or worse — a group that he considers more aligned with his approach and his philosophies. Their success would be his success. But if another season devolves into yet another pile of steaming garbage — well, that will fall squarely on him, too. To that end, perhaps, Jackson said that he planned to be more involved in the team’s day-to-day business. Last season, he said, he was careful not to overstep his bounds. He wanted to give Fisher a wide berth to coach and, as Jackson put it, learn the ropes in a tough business. But Jackson said Fisher approached him in the off-season and asked that he be more hands-on. “I thought maybe I stepped back too far last year,” Jackson said. “I wanted Derek to be his own person, have his own feel for this.” Fisher said he would be remiss not to seek Jackson’s input.
sports/basketball,“I feel like we’ve found a better rhythm,” Fisher said. Fisher is also likely to lean on Anthony, who will enter training camp seven months removed from knee surgery and free of restrictions from the team’s medical staff. Fisher said he would still exercise caution. “We’ll just have to gauge how he’s responding,” Fisher said. In June, it was reported by several news outlets, including The New York Times, that Anthony was displeased with the team’s off-season moves. Anthony has since denied being upset, going so far as to describe Porzingis as the “steal” of the draft on one of his social media accounts. On Friday, Mills sought to emphasize that the team already has solid chemistry, citing the seven teammates who joined Anthony for a charity event in Puerto Rico over the summer. The group worked out for about a week. “I think that demonstrates it’s a group that understands what it takes to be a good team,” Mills said. Fisher acknowledged that there were questions about how Anthony felt regarding some of the team’s personnel decisions. “I think he actually enjoys and likes working with these guys,” Fisher said. “Health is an important thing to a pro athlete, and when you’re healthy, your perspective changes on a lot of things.” Much attention — from news media, from fans, from the coaching staff — will be paid to Porzingis, the 19-year-old forward whom the Knicks selected with the fourth pick in the draft. Porzingis, who worked to add bulk to his scarecrow, 7-foot-1 frame over the off-season by consuming industrial-size meals, has been a regular presence at the team’s practice facility.
sports/basketball,“He’s essentially the first one here every morning, at 7:30 a.m.,” Fisher said. “He beat me here a couple of times in the last couple of weeks, and we think he’s going to be fine. We don’t have to force his development. We’re not going to place undue expectations on him just because of the number he was drafted. This is a long-term process.” Jackson said he was encouraged by a recent conversation with Pau Gasol, whom Jackson coached when Gasol was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers. Gasol reminded Jackson that he weighed 227 pounds when he joined the Memphis Grizzlies as a rookie in 2001. Gasol now weighs about 255 pounds. Gasol, Jackson said, told him that Porzingis would grow into his body. “We’ve tried to expedite that,” Jackson said, “and he’s been very receptive to the work that it takes to become an N.B.A. player.” To underscore the point, Mills said that he spotted Porzingis in a cold tub after a recent workout, which was nothing out of the ordinary — except that Porzingis was multitasking by watching videos on his cellphone of Usain Bolt in hopes of improving his running technique. It remains to be seen whether this anecdote someday becomes prophetic or inconsequential. On Friday, though, the Knicks were undefeated, the outlook was bright, and nobody could blame them for enjoying the feeling.
arts/design,At $55 million, a Ferrari Races Into the Stratosphere - The New York Times What is the most desirable — and equally important, tradable — of all collectibles? Unless Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” or the Koh-i-Noor diamond comes on the market any time soon, there is an argument for that accolade going not to a work of art, or a diamond, but to a racecar. Just 39 examples of the Ferrari 250 GTO, a coupe capable of 160 miles per hour, were created by the Italian carmaker between 1962 and 1964. Thirty-six featured a three-liter V12 engine, with a further three four-liter versions. Among the last front-engine cars to be competitive at the highest level, the GTO twice almost managed to win the Le Mans 24 hour race (finishing second in 1962 and 1963) and has, for decades, been the ultimate prize for the world’s wealthiest auto collectors. Over the last several years there has been speculation about whether a GTO might change hands privately for more than $50 million. Until recently, in the absence of a confirmed sale of a desirable GTO, the highest price paid for any auto would appear to be the 24 million pounds (about $39 million at the time) given in 2014 for a 1957 prototype of Ferrari’s marginally less coveted Testa Rossa competition racer. Then last month, Talacrest, a classic Ferrari dealer based in Ascot, southern England, offered for sale the second 250 GTO to have been built, with a publicly quoted price of $55 million.
arts/design,“If the $50 million barrier is going to be broken by a GTO, it will be broken by this car,” said Steve Linden, a classic car adviser based on Long Island, N.Y. “The market has softened a bit, but when it comes to the most special cars, the sky is still the limit.” Most of the rarest and most valuable classic cars these days are sold through discreet transactions like this, rather than at auction. Originally sold in 1962 to Luigi Chinetti’s North American Racing Team in New York, Talacrest’s left-hand-drive example is painted in the team’s signature metallic blue with a central white racing stripe. It was driven to a second-place finish in the 1962 Sebring 12-hour endurance event in Florida and sixth overall at that year’s Le Mans, followed by a further three years of competition racing in America — all history that enhances the car’s value. The most recent of the GTO’s eight American owners is Bernard J. Carl, a lawyer based in Washington, who acquired chassis number 3387 — as the car is known to GTO aficionados — in 1997 for an undisclosed sum. “I’ve had a couple of offers, but they haven’t quite reached the required deal,” said John Collins, the founder of Talacrest. “There’s no rush. You have to be patient. Usually the right deal eventually comes up.” What sets the Ferrari 250 GTO apart is that, aside from being a competition sports car, and the most desirable brand in motoring, it is also a two-seater that you could, if you wanted, drive to your local grocery store.
arts/design,“Not only is it a rare car, you can use it on the road,” Mr. Collins said. “It’s a ticket to the billionaires’ club. You can show it off on the GTO Tour,” he added, referring to a gathering of Ferrari GTO owners every five years, including personalities like Nick Mason, the drummer for Pink Floyd. The last such rally, held over four days in northern France in 2012 to celebrate the 50th anniversary, attracted 23 of the 39 cars. The fact that the Ferrari 250 GTO is rare, but not too rare, is another secret of the car’s collectability, said Simon Kidston, founder of the Geneva-based dealership Kidston and the K500 database of classic car prices. “If there were only one of them you wouldn’t know if it was worth $1 million or $100 million,” Mr. Kidston said. “You’d also have to explain what it is to your friends. People know exactly what a Ferrari GTO is. It has instant recognition. And the fact that there are more than 30 means there’s a market for them.” Mr. Kidston should know, having in September negotiated the private sale of another 250 GTO. He would not confirm details of the transaction, but said it was most likely to have been “the highest-priced car to have changed hands in 2016.” The car is listed on the authoritative Barchetta online directory of classic Ferraris as being a red 1962 model (chassis number 3809) owned by Hartmut Ibing, a collector in Düsseldorf, Germany. Barchetta said it was sold by Mr. Kidston for $45 million.
arts/design,According to Mr. Kidston, Ferrari 250 GTOs range in value from $40 million to $70 million, depending on the race history and condition. Back in 2012, a highly coveted apple-green example (chassis number 3505) made for the renowned British driver Stirling Moss sold privately for $35 million. Given the $55 million asking price for chassis number 3387, it is obvious that these cars are also a desirable investment. They may primarily change hands privately, but a Ferrari 250 GTO holds the current high for any car at auction. In August 2014, Bonhams sold a 1962 model (chassis number 3851) that had belonged to Fabrizio Violati, an Italian historic racing driver who died in 2010, for $38.1 million. It had been estimated to sell for more than $40 million, but the fact that it was a rebuilt “death car” — the French ski champion Henri Oreiller died in a crash in it in 1962 — and was being sold by an intermediary, rather than Mr. Violati’s family, may have put off potential bidders. Whatever the nature of the transaction, condition remains the most contentious criteria for a would-be Ferrari 250 GTO buyer. “It’s as original and as good a GTO as you can get,” Mr. Collins said of his $55 million car. “Original” is always a relative term, however, since the car is an aluminum-bodied racer designed to be driven flat-out for as long as possible (Ferrari regarded a speedometer as superfluous to the design.)
arts/design,The engine of the Talacrest car was replaced around 1964 and the body was “completely” restored in 1976-1977, according to Mr. Collins. “There are very few 100 percent original bodies, and no one really knows,” said Stuart Carpenter, founder of Copley Motorcars, a Massachusetts classic car dealership specializing in Ferraris. “You have to compromise. You have to ask yourself, do I want to wait for a Holy Grail GTO, or do I buy a good one?” He added that currently he knew of two buyers prepared to pay $65 million for a GTO. But what is the Ferrari 250 GTO actually like to drive? “It’s an aluminum car. There is no soundproofing. The engine sounds like a symphony,” said Jean Berchon, the longtime organizer of the GTO Tour, who five summers ago had the privilege of driving Mr. Carl’s metallic blue Ferrari to a private dinner at the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley, France. “The handling was memorable, the beauty of it was memorable. I was driving the most exclusive car in the world. It was like being in heaven.” The only snag? The ticket now costs $55 million.
us,Corker Stops Progress of Budget Deal, Even as Pressure for More Spending Builds - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  A single senator on Tuesday stopped the advance of a House-Senate agreement that would ostensibly deliver the first balanced budget of this century, but the deal’s fate faced far greater obstacles than just his objections. Even before its official unveiling, the agreement is already threatened with irrelevance amid a bipartisan clamor for more spending in a new era of loosening belts. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and one of the bill’s negotiators, refused to sign the budget agreement, which would set spending levels for the coming fiscal year and prescribe policies over the next decade intended to balance the budget. He denounced a “budget gimmick” that he said would allow Congress to spend more now by pushing other spending until later. But the spending pressure is accelerating. The House and the Senate Armed Services Committees are drafting legislation that would move what lawmakers characterize as emergency war funds into the Defense Department’s base budget, breaking military spending caps in reality, if not in law, and increasing the prospect of needing to raise them again in coming years. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing measures to speed the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process for drugs and medical devices, which would probably require additional spending. Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, introduced legislation on Tuesday to expand Pell Grants that the new budget deal is supposed to freeze.
us,From the outside, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a co-author of the balanced budget agreement of 1997, called for doubling the National Institutes of Health’s budget. All of those efforts would conflict with the strict domestic spending caps established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 — which the Republican budget accord did nothing to change. “A lot of people are talking about how we can increase money for N.I.H.; everyone’s for it,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. “But within the budget caps, it’s impossible to do.” Meantime, House Republicans continue to pass a variety of tax cuts, including a full repeal of the estate tax that now hits only a few thousand inheritances a year. The budget’s prescriptions “are not real, they are not workable,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat. The budget accord awaiting Mr. Corker’s signature would use parliamentary language called “reconciliation instructions” to allow Congress this year to repeal the Affordable Care Act using legislation that could not be filibustered and could pass the Senate with 51 votes instead of the usual 60. But President Obama would still veto it. The agreement calls for the budget to balance over the next decade by paring entitlements like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security by $1.2 trillion. Medicare would be cut by $431 billion, education and job training by $162 billion. Beyond the strict spending caps set in 2011, the Republican budget assumes still further cuts of $496 billion to domestic discretionary programs. Any increase in spending over those caps would prompt automatic spending cuts, called “sequestration.”
us,The Republican-driven accord also rolls back parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street regulatory law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Republican leaders have given no indication that Congress will actually draft the legislation to carry out the cuts, such as a bill to turn Medicaid and food stamps into block grants for the states. And for budget hawks like Mr. Corker, even the aspirational prescriptions in the budget accord are not tough enough. Negotiators agreed to add $58 billion to the Pentagon’s war account, money the Armed Services Committees are already moving from that emergency account to the Defense Department’s core operating budget. They cut a provision requiring 60 Senate votes for just such a move. But Mr. Corker said his real concern was over an obscure maneuver called “changes in mandatory programs,” which allows lawmakers to spend more on programs at their annual discretion by delaying spending on some “mandatory” programs that operate under fixed rules. “It’s a budget gimmick,” Mr. Corker said. “It’s $190 billion in extra spending over a 10-year period, and it’s something our caucus all had been for eliminating a year ago.” Republican leaders called the dispute temporary. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, said the budget agreement should come to a House vote on Thursday. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he, too, hoped for a final vote this week. But once it is passed, the pressure to violate it will be immediate and intense.
us,“Repeal of sequestration on defense, that’s what needs to be done,” said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and Armed Services Committee chairman. “Every uniformed leader has testified before the committee that we are putting the lives of American men and women serving in the military in greater danger.” The pull on the domestic side is nearly as strong. Mr. Portman’s new student aid bill would expand Pell Grant eligibility to high school students taking college courses, aiming federal aid at students Mr. Portman said were more likely to complete college. “This is not necessarily an effort to spend more; it’s to spend it more wisely,” Mr. Portman said, even as he conceded that the bill would probably require more money up front. Legislation being drafted in the House by Representatives Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, and Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, would speed the F.D.A.’s medical approval process. Mr. McCarthy predicted it would not cost more money. But Ms. DeGette disagreed. “We do have significant new resources” in the legislation, said Matt Inzeo, Ms. DeGette’s spokesman. “The bill itself would address the caps. We have been anticipating this issue.” And Democrats are turning up the heat. President Obama has pledged to veto any spending bill that abides by the budget’s limits, and Democrats pledged Tuesday to uphold those vetoes. On the revenue side of the ledger, the House is showing little concern for the deficit. The budget agreement projects that revenue will remain constant over the next 10 years, even though it also assumes the full repeal of the health care law and the more than $1 trillion in taxes attached to it.
us,But the House is not holding revenues constant. Already this year, that chamber has passed $405 billion in tax cuts, with $181 billion more approved by the House Ways and Means Committee and awaiting floor action. That includes, for $270 billion, the full repeal of the estate tax, even though it has been so scaled back in recent years that it affects only about 5,400 of the nation’s richest families each year. Despite those pressures, Mr. McCarthy was resolute that the budget’s spending restrictions would hold. Republicans would be willing to loosen the reins if the cuts were shifted to entitlement programs, he said, but they will not give in to Mr. Obama’s demands that some new revenue be included in a new budget deal. “The caps will hold,” he said. “The caps are the law.”
arts,Court Blocks Berkshire Museum’s Sale of Rockwell Works and Other Art - The New York Times The Massachusetts Appeals Court on Friday blocked a much-anticipated auction next week of art from the Berkshire Museum, including two paintings by Norman Rockwell. Those works — including one titled “Shuffleton’s Barbershop,” with an estimated price of $20 million to $30 million — are among seven from the Pittsfield, Mass., museum that were scheduled to be offered for sale Monday by Sotheby’s in New York in an effort to raise money the museum considers essential to its survival. The sale had been opposed by two groups of plaintiffs, including Rockwell’s sons, as well as the office of the Massachusetts attorney general, which said that it would violate various trusts and restrictions related to how the works must be handled. The attorney general, Maura Healey, who had been seeking additional time to examine the museum’s plan, asked the court on Friday for an injunction halting the sale. The court granted that request, saying that allowing the sale created more of a risk than stopping it. The ruling prohibits the museum “from selling, auctioning or otherwise disposing of any of the artworks that have been listed for auction.” The injunction will expire on Dec. 11, but the court added that the attorney general’s office may move to extend it. Sotheby’s had described the Berkshire Museum works as a “superb collection” that was “among the highlights” of its American Art sale on Monday.
arts,In addition to “Shuffleton’s Barbershop,” which Sotheby’s said Rockwell created for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1950, the auction was to include Rockwell’s “Blacksmith’s Boy — Heel and Toe (Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop),” which was estimated to have a price of $7 million to $10 million. Among other museum works to be offered on Monday were “The White Dress” by Thomas Wilmer Dewing, “Hunter in Winter Wood” by George Henry Durrie and “Connecticut River Valley, Claremont, New Hampshire” by Albert Bierstadt. Last summer, the financially strapped museum announced the planned sale of 40 works, including Impressionist and modern art, contemporary art, 19th-century European paintings, American art and Chinese art. The museum said the proceeds were needed to build its endowment, renovate its building and expand programming to create a “heightened emphasis on science and history.” Officials from the museum and from Sotheby’s said they were disappointed by the decision. Elizabeth McGraw, the president of the museum’s board of trustees called the court decision a “setback” for the institution and its neighbors. “The auction that held the promise of addressing our museum’s serious financial difficulties will have to proceed without our works, and our plans for the future will be delayed,” she said in a written statement. “Until that process resolves, we will continue to do what we do every day: bring our passion for art, science and discovery to our community.” The auction house confirmed that Monday’s auction would go forward with the rest of more than 70 works that have been slated for sale.
arts,“We have never doubted that the board of trustees acted in good faith and was well within their legal rights,” Sotheby’s said in a statement, “and we remain confident that they will prevail in their plans to ensure a bright future for the Berkshire Museum in support of the community of Pittsfield and western Massachusetts.” Michael B. Keating, a lawyer for the Rockwell family and others seeking to stop the sale, said his clients fully supported the decision that blocked the auction of the museum items and “the irreparable harm that would occur if these paintings were to be sold.” Museum organizations have condemned the museum’s deaccessioning plan, saying it violated guidelines against the sale of art to subsidize operating and other expenses instead of using such proceeds to enhance or maintain a collection. Rockwell’s sons and a group of museum members sued separately to stop the sale. But Judge John A. Agostini of Berkshire Superior Court found that they lacked legal standing. Judge Agostini also denied a request by the attorney general to block the sale. The state’s lawyers told the appeals court on Friday that the museum was looking to sell nearly all of its valuable art. Doing so would violate a number of trusts, they said, including what they described as a promise to Rockwell that his works would remain in the permanent collection and another pledge that some of the works slated for auction would never leave Pittsfield.
arts,“This sale is unprecedented in terms of the number, value and prominence of the works being proposed, the centrality of these works to the museum’s collection, and the process the museum employed to select and dispose of the deaccessioned items,” the attorney general’s office said in its filing on Friday. The lower court had described the attorney general’s office as a “reluctant warrior,” whose objections had not included specific details on how it would review the planned sale. It noted that a delay would have “considerable financial consequences” for the museum. It did not find that the museum had violated any of the charitable trusts through which it had come into possession of the art. The attorney general’s office countered in its filing on Friday that while the museum could sell the works in the future, any items disposed of at auction would be very difficult to get back. It said the museum had not abided by its most pressing mission — to preserve its charitable purpose — and that whatever the financial hurdles, its relationship to other museums and with donors would be damaged by the sale.
national/portraits,Jane Simpkin: 'An Ongoing Art Project' - The New York Times Jane Simpkin seemed drawn to the unusual, and vice versa. When she was standing on her mother's porch in Wayland, Mass., one day, a baby bald eagle landed at her feet. While she was driving to work one time, a bright blue parakeet flew into the car. She was amassing tattoos, which her sister Laura called "an ongoing art project." There was a British lion on each of her shoulder blades, applied when she visited England recently, and a gryphon on her chest. She loved to travel; often the tattoos were mementos of places she visited. She worked for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, but her plan was to become an entertainment lawyer. Last Sept. 11, she was a passenger on United Airlines Flight 175, on her way to Los Angeles for a meeting.
style,Who Will Be America’s Next Top Mentor? - The New York Times The January issues of fashion magazines usually contain extra lashings of diet and exercise advice (and the fewest ads of the year), but this month’s Elle, with Nicole Kidman on the cover, offers something new. To celebrate its third decade, the magazine announced, it is convening “a board of 43 female powerhouses who are joining forces to improve the lives of women — that’s you! — for the next 30 years.” Following are headshots of these powerhouses — among them, the fashion designer Tory Burch; Sylvie Picquet-Damesme, fashion publicist; and the cosmetics entrepreneur and former model Iman — as well as digestible little energy bars of their advice, like having the courage of one’s convictions and maintaining an open mind. “You just hit the mentor jackpot,” the magazine promises. But is this a jackpot or a bottomless pit? After years of women fearing that their career advisers may chase them around the conference table (“9 to 5”), or stab them in the back (“Working Girl”), is it possible that they now suffer from a surfeit of supportive you-go-sister pompoms? That the presidential race of 2016 may be less crowded than the race to be America’s Next Top Mentor? Looming like the Cheshire cat above all the cheerleaders has been the beatific countenance of Sheryl Sandberg, 45, the Facebook chief operating officer who started the great Lean In wave of 2013 with a book that still lingers on best-seller lists and generated countless if occasionally vague consciousness-raisings about inequities in the workplace.
style,“She was the gateway drug,” said Andy McNicol, a literary agent at William Morris Endeavor whose colleague Jennifer Rudolph Walsh represented Ms. Sandberg in the deal with her publisher, Knopf. (All profits from the book are being plowed into the tax-exempt foundation Leanin.Org, according to its website.) Responsibility for the mentoring moment, though, cannot be pinned squarely on this one executive’s lapel. Consider the fall of the man in the gray flannel suit on the commuter platform, vanquished by the guy at home freelancing in his yoga pants. As well as the rise of reality shows, with tough-love celebrity judges (“You’re fired!”) softening of late into gentler “coaches” (“The Voice.”) And the mushrooming of social media, which has empowered a fresh pack of self-styled leaders like one of Ms. McNicol’s clients, the online retailer Sophia Amoruso of Nasty Gal. Indeed, it was just a year after the publication of “Lean In” that Ms. Amoruso’s pink-covered book “#Girlboss” was published by Portfolio, a Penguin imprint that specializes in business titles. “Each one has a special flavor,” said Portfolio’s founder, president and publisher, Adrian Zackheim, about mentor books (which he considers just a variant of the advice genre). Ms. Amoruso’s was particularly salty, filled with curse words and tales of Dumpster-diving and school-hating in the years before she turned to selling vintage clothes on eBay. “You’re going to take over the world and change it in the process,” she promised her readers.
style,“People told Sophia she should write a style book,” Ms. McNicol said with an air of triumph, and Ms. Amoruso, 30, will probably do so ere long. A disproportionate number of the New Mentors seem to emanate from the image business, perhaps because they are already used to being groomed for the spotlight, or perhaps because they are adept at catering to the out-of-control appetite for personal brand management that the Internet has stoked. One who is leveraging branding to the max is Aliza Licht, 40, the senior vice president for global communications at Donna Karan International, who is better known as DKNY PR GIRL. Ms. Licht has parlayed her half a million-plus Twitter followers into speaking engagements, like at a TEDx conference in 2013 (TED and its ilk being essential pit stops for New Mentors) and a deal with Grand Central Publishing for a book to be published in May titled, “Leave Your Mark: Land Your Dream Job, Kill It in Your Career, Rock Social Media.” The cover image shows a Starbucksish coffee cup with a lipstick print. To Women’s Wear Daily, Ms. Licht unequivocally called the book-to-be a “mentorship.” And if your dream job has nothing to do with clothes? No problem. “Fashion in general could be an amazing boot camp for your life,” suggested Ms. Licht, calling from a company car that was swooshing her home after a trip to Art Basel in Miami Beach. “Fashion people work really hard.”
style,Ms. McNicol said she sees a link between the publishing world’s “fascination with youth” and the surge of such books from the fashion, cosmetics and other glamour industries. An event called Fun Fearless Life held by Cosmopolitan magazine in November at the David H. Koch Theater that she helped organize was chock-a-block with New Mentors — Ms. Amoruso, Spanx’s Sara Blakely, Christene Barberich of the website Refinery29 and Hannah Bronfman, a founder of an app called Beautified, among others — offering career tips to a sold-out, mostly millennial crowd. “Those girls 18 to 24,” Ms. McNicol said, “they want to learn.” At 28, Devon Brooks, a founder of Blo, the blow-dry franchise, is an elder stateswoman to this demographic: a popular speaker represented by the Lavin Agency, whose client list includes Salman Rushdie. “She actively mentors and coaches start-ups and developing professionals,” Ms. Brooks’s biography reads. “Millennials, start your engines!” Ms. Brooks, of Toronto, does not have a book deal — yet. (Publishers, start your engines!) But if she gets one, she will be jostling for shelf space with her fellow countrywomen Janet Kestin and Nancy Vonk, alumnae of Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising agency, who came up with Dove’s “real beauty” campaign and now oversee Swim Program, a so-called “creative leadership consultancy” serving “ambitious people.” Alan Webber, a founder of Fast Company magazine, calls this duo’s own book, “The how-to follow-up to ‘Lean In.’ ” Its title, taken from the condescending advice of a male boss who advised against combining children with a career, is “Darling, You Can’t Do Both: And Other Noise to Ignore on the Way Up.”
style,Replacing this old, punitive John T. Molloy model of male mentor (Mr. Molloy wrote “Dress for Success” and the lesser-known “Live for Success”) is the gentler Tim Gunn, 61, the former chairman of the fashion department at Parsons, the design school. He refined his persona on the cable show “Project Runway,” and his second book of career advice, “The Natty Professor: A Master Class on Mentoring, Motivating and Making It Work!” is scheduled for March. His first, “Gunn’s Golden Rules,” in which he established himself as a personal life coach, was “to date his best seller,” said Jennifer Bergstrom, Mr. Gunn’s publisher at Gallery Books. She said that a recent style book he wrote, “Tim Gunn’s Fashion Bible,” had not performed as well. “We decided we wanted him to shift his focus back to that mentoring, teaching — imparting life lessons once again,” Ms. Bergstrom said, adding with a laugh: “ ‘Lean In’ to me was a little intimidating, but I don’t feel that way with Tim Gunn.” Also offering a sudden populist relatability is the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, 68, wife of first an aristocrat and now a billionaire, who has a column in InStyle magazine and a recently published memoir, “The Woman I Wanted to Be.” It has a blurb from Ms. Sandberg on the back. Its release, in November, was timed to the debut of a show on E!, “House of DVF,” that established Ms. von Furstenberg as a glamorously exacting overseer of aspiring “brand ambassadors” for her label.
style,During a party for the book at the Manhattan headquarters of Michael Bloomberg’s philanthropic foundation, the young designer Joseph Altuzarra praised the real-life mentoring abilities of Ms. von Furstenberg, the longtime president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “She’s incredibly nurturing and I think tells you the truth,” he said. “She told me when I was going off-course, doing things that weren’t wearable or just she felt weren’t in the brand. She’s not shy about her opinions, and I’d say she’s pretty much always right.” But this always-rightness may be slightly out of step with the New Mentors argot, which stresses that it is necessary to make mistakes, to dream big and to be a little goofy and out of the box and “disruptive.” Ms. McNicol, the agent, thinks even the term mentor may be due for a makeover. “I think that was a big buzzword for a different generation,” she said. “Younger people are going to have a problem with that word. I can’t imagine them walking into someone’s office and saying ‘can you mentor me?’ ”
nyregion,De Blasio Strikes Conciliatory Note on Pre-K - The New York Times
opinion,Rep. Weiner: ‘I Don’t Know What I Was Thinking’ - The New York Times For more than a week, Representative Anthony Weiner, a New York City Democrat, baldly lied in denying that he had sent a lewd photo of himself to a woman over Twitter, claiming that his account was hacked. When he finally and tearfully confessed the truth on Monday, it turned out to be worse than expected: He admitted to a longstanding pattern of sending inappropriate photos to women. Over the last three years, Mr. Weiner said, he has conducted sexually charged Internet and telephone conversations with six women whom he has never met, sending similar photographs without even knowing the real identities — or ages — of the recipients. It was a profoundly squalid and offensive pattern of conduct, admitted only after some of the photographs began to emerge on the Web. It also raises serious questions about his judgment and character, considering that he was once considered one of the savvier members of the House. Had it not occurred to him, in an era of unending sexual scandal, that repeatedly sending these kinds of photographs to strangers would eventually catch up with him? And that, if it did, his attempt to exploit his political celebrity for online sexual gratification would be considered reprehensible? This was a man who had hoped to lead the City of New York as mayor, a dream that now seems unimaginable.
opinion,Mr. Weiner says he will not resign, and there is no evidence yet that he broke the law or abused the resources of his office. He said the computer and BlackBerry that he used were his own, not issued by the government. But Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was right to call for an ethics investigation into whether he had broken any House rules, an investigation with which Mr. Weiner said he would cooperate. If it shows that he did abuse his office, he should resign. But if he chooses to run for re-election next year, voters in Brooklyn and Queens will at least have a chance to decide whether they want a man like Mr. Weiner representing their interests in Congress.
business,Bad Math and a Coming Public Pension Crisis  - The New York Times When Jim Palermo was serving as a trustee of the village of La Grange, Ill., he noticed something peculiar about the local police officers and firefighters. They were not going to live as long as might be expected, at least according to pension tables. After Mr. Palermo dug into the numbers, he found that the actuary — the person who advises pension plan trustees about how much money to set aside — was using a mortality table from 1971 that showed La Grange’s roughly 100 police officers and firefighters were expected to die, on average, before reaching 75, compared with 79 under a more recent table. The four years are significant beyond any interest in macabre statistics. When actuaries calculate the numbers for a pension plan, mortality rates are a powerful hidden factor. If an actuary predicts the workers will live to an old age, it means they will be drawing their pensions for more years. That, in turn, means the employer should set aside more money up front, to keep from running out later. Assuming shorter life spans reduces annual contributions and frees up money for other things, like bigger current paychecks. And if the plan bases pensions on pay, as those in most American cities do, shortening the workers’ life spans on paper could lead to both fatter paychecks now and bigger pensions in the future. In La Grange’s case, those four years meant tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to each retiree.
business,But if more workers are retiring and not dying on schedule, it can be a recipe for financial disaster. The recommendations made by pension actuaries, like which mortality table to use, are largely hidden from public view, but each decision ripples across decades and can have an outsize effect. More and more actuaries are now worried that their profession will be blamed for its role in steering states and cities into what is looking like a trillion-dollar quagmire. On Thursday, a panel of senior actuaries will consider whether to update, or elaborate on, the existing actuarial standards for public pensions. The dueling mortality tables will be among the evidence, and Mr. Palermo is among the parties who have submitted written testimony. It is only the second time in recent memory that the Actuarial Standards Board has held a public hearing, an indication of the gravity of the nation’s pension woes. State and local governments have promised several trillion dollars’ worth of benefits to retirees — the exact amount is in dispute. Now, with large numbers of public workers retiring, the money set aside is turning out to be at least a trillion dollars short. Retirees are counting on the money promised to them. Taxpayers are in no mood to bail out troubled pension funds. Some are looking for scapegoats. “Actuaries make a juicy target,” said Mary Pat Campbell, an actuary who responded to the board’s call for comments.
business,She expressed concern that elected officials were using actuaries to lend respectability to “questionable behavior” like funding pensions with borrowed money, picking risky investments and “enacting benefit improvements based on lowballed costs.” Other commentators have focused on the opacity of actuaries’ calculations and reports to the boards of trustees that govern public pension plans. Trustees need clear and honest projections and do not receive them, a former pension trustee from Kentucky, Christopher Tobe, wrote. He recalled seeing an assumption for future investment returns jump to 7.75 percent from 4.5 percent, with no explanation. The change lowered the state’s pension obligations by more than a billion dollars, which in turn meant smaller contributions. Another commentator, Mark Glennon, told the board that actuaries were churning out reports that no one but other actuaries could understand, providing cover for elected officials who were letting problems spin out of control. “Chicago represents the most glaring example,” wrote Mr. Glennon, the founder of an online news service, WirePoints, which covers the fiscal morass in Illinois. “An actuary could have looked only briefly at some of its pension reports from years ago and seen the calamity to come. Reporters, political leadership and most pension trustees could not. Those who could understand were able to remain silent.” In La Grange, Mr. Palermo, who was elected in 2007, thought the pension funds were being shortchanged. More and more police officers and firefighters were retiring, and they were not dying according to the mortality table used by the actuary. Between them, the two pension funds had less than half the money they should. If this continued, he said, the money would eventually run short, and people would get hurt.
business,And not just in La Grange. The actuary, Timothy W. Sharpe, had the biggest market share of police and fire pension business in Illinois. “I think it’s a moral hazard,” Mr. Palermo said. Mr. Palermo, who works in financial services, determined Mr. Sharpe was using a table from 1971, which tracked a group of people born from 1914 to 1918, who retired from 1964 to 1968. It is seldom used these days. A table from 2000 is considered more accurate, and in 2014 the Society of Actuaries issued an even newer one. Mr. Palermo researched mortality rates in the American work force and found no evidence that police and firefighters die younger than other public workers. Finally, he sent a confidential complaint to the Actuarial Board for Counseling and Discipline, which deals with actuaries who stray from the profession’s standards of practice. A few months later, his complaint was written up in a village manager’s report and distributed at a public meeting. Mr. Palermo had accused Mr. Sharpe of making statements that were “frequently erroneous and incomplete,” it said. He had accused Mr. Sharpe of misleading the village board and persuading it to incorporate the wrong mortality assumptions into the local tax levy. The news media pounced. The village manager’s report strongly suggested that Mr. Palermo was a troublemaker with few allies in the local government. It said he had acted on his own and that most of the village board was on Mr. Sharpe’s side.
business,It also said that Mr. Sharpe had refused to supply any numbers until the complaint was resolved, so the village had no numbers on which to base the coming year’s tax levy. It was about to miss a state deadline. Mr. Sharpe sent a letter to The Doings, La Grange’s newspaper, saying that he had the unanimous support of the police and fire trustees. “I will not be intimidated,” he wrote. In a phone interview, Mr. Sharpe said that he had been instructed to use the 1971 mortality table by the Illinois Insurance Department. Even though it was old, he said, he considered it more realistic because it projected death rates out to age 110. The table from 2000 uses a different population sample and projects death rates out to age 120. If La Grange projected life spans the way Mr. Palermo wanted, he added, it would “be collecting taxes to pay for pensions to people assumed to live to age 120,” a needless expense. Mr. Sharpe said those additional 10 years were particularly troubling. “In Illinois, our pensions start very early, at age 50 for police and fire,” he said. “There’s a 3 percent compounded cost-of-living increase that goes on for life. So the pensions at the later ages of life — I’m talking about after 100, for instance — get very, very large. The person who gets a $50,000 pension at age 50 would get a $250,000 pension by age 100.”
business,He provided data on public workers’ death rates from the Illinois Insurance Department, which showed that no one in the state ever lived that long. That is why he said the more recent mortality table could lead to needless tax increases. In a separate interview, Mr. Palermo said he could not discuss his complaint, which has been resolved, but said that by focusing on the oldest years of the mortality tables, Mr. Sharpe was diverting attention from the much more relevant middle years, where the probability of death was much greater in the 1971 table. For 50-year-olds, for example, the risk of death was seen as more than double in 1971 than what is expected in the later table. Neither man disclosed how the complaint was resolved. But their battle appears to have no clear-cut victor. Mr. Sharpe, who now uses the newer mortality table, no longer consults for La Grange’s police and fire pension trustees. Mr. Palermo did not seek re-election and stepped down in May. As for the pension system, Mr. Sharpe’s successor changed the mortality projections, and La Grange’s required minimum pension contribution increased by 20 percent. More increases are coming, but the city has tax caps and cannot catch up quickly without cutting other services. Mr. Palermo fears it’s too late. “It’s probably beyond repair,” he said. “We’re at the point where we’re just managing the decline.”
magazine,I.B.M.'s Supercomputer to Challenge 'Jeopardy!' Champions - The New York Times “Toured the Burj in this U.A.E. city. They say it’s the tallest tower in the world; looked over the ledge and lost my lunch.” This is the quintessential sort of clue you hear on the TV game show “Jeopardy!” It’s witty (the clue’s category is    “Postcards From the Edge”), demands a large store of trivia and requires contestants to make confident, split-second decisions. This particular clue appeared in a mock version of the game in December, held in Hawthorne, N.Y. at one of I.B.M.’s research labs. Two contestants — Dorothy Gilmartin, a health teacher with her hair tied back in a ponytail, and Alison Kolani, a copy editor — furrowed their brows in concentration. Who would be the first to answer? Neither, as it turned out. Both were beaten to the buzzer by the third combatant: Watson, a supercomputer. For the last three years, I.B.M. scientists have been developing what they expect will be the world’s most advanced “question answering” machine, able to understand a question posed in everyday human elocution — “natural language,” as computer scientists call it — and respond with a precise, factual answer. In other words, it must do more than what search engines like Google and Bing do, which is merely point to a document where you might find the answer. It has to pluck out the correct answer itself. Technologists have long regarded this sort of artificial intelligence as a holy grail, because it would allow machines to converse more naturally with people, letting us ask questions instead of typing keywords. Software firms and university scientists have produced question-answering systems for years, but these have mostly been limited to simply phrased questions. Nobody ever tackled “Jeopardy!” because experts assumed that even for the latest artificial intelligence, the game was simply too hard: the clues are too puzzling and allusive, and the breadth of trivia is too wide.
magazine,With Watson, I.B.M. claims it has cracked the problem — and aims to prove as much on national TV. The producers of “Jeopardy!” have agreed to pit Watson against some of the game’s best former players as early as this fall. To test Watson’s capabilities against actual humans, I.B.M.’s scientists began holding live matches last winter. They mocked up a conference room to resemble the actual “Jeopardy!” set, including buzzers and stations for the human contestants, brought in former contestants from the show and even hired a host for the occasion: Todd Alan Crain, who plays a newscaster on the satirical Onion News Network. Technically speaking, Watson wasn’t in the room. It was one floor up and consisted of a roomful of servers working at speeds thousands of times faster than most ordinary desktops. Over its three-year life, Watson stored the content of tens of millions of documents, which it now accessed to answer questions about almost anything. (Watson is not connected to the Internet; like all “Jeopardy!” competitors, it knows only what is already in its “brain.”) During the sparring matches, Watson received the questions as electronic texts at the same moment they were made visible to the human players; to answer a question, Watson spoke in a machine-synthesized voice through a small black speaker on the game-show set. When it answered the Burj clue — “What is Dubai?” (“Jeopardy!” answers must be phrased as questions) — it sounded like a perkier cousin of the computer in the movie “WarGames” that nearly destroyed the world by trying to start a nuclear war.
magazine,This time, though, the computer was doing the right thing. Watson won $1,000 (in pretend money, anyway), pulled ahead and eventually defeated Gilmartin and Kolani soundly, winning $18,400 to their $12,000 each. “Watson,” Crain shouted, “is our new champion!” It was just the beginning. Over the rest of the day, Watson went on a tear, winning four of six games. It displayed remarkable facility with cultural trivia (“This action flick starring Roy Scheider in a high-tech police helicopter was also briefly a TV series” — “What is ‘Blue Thunder’?”), science (“The greyhound originated more than 5,000 years ago in this African country, where it was used to hunt gazelles” — “What is Egypt?”) and sophisticated wordplay (“Classic candy bar that’s a female Supreme Court justice” — “What is Baby Ruth Ginsburg?”). By the end of the day, the seven human contestants were impressed, and even slightly unnerved, by Watson. Several made references to Skynet, the computer system in the “Terminator” movies that achieves consciousness and decides humanity should be destroyed. “My husband and I talked about what my role in this was,” Samantha Boardman, a graduate student, told me jokingly. “Was I the thing that was going to help the A.I. become aware of itself?” She had distinguished herself with her swift responses to the “Rhyme Time” puzzles in one of her games, winning nearly all of them before Watson could figure out the clues, but it didn’t help. The computer still beat her three times. In one game, she finished with no money.
magazine,“He plays to win,” Boardman said, shaking her head. “He’s really not messing around!” Like most of the contestants, she had started calling Watson “he.” WE LIVE IN AN AGE of increasingly smart machines. In recent years, engineers have pushed into areas, from voice recognition to robotics to search engines, that once seemed to be the preserve of humans. But I.B.M. has a particular knack for pitting man against machine. In 1997, the company’s supercomputer Deep Blue famously beat the grandmaster Garry Kasparov at chess, a feat that generated enormous publicity for I.B.M. It did not, however, produce a marketable product; the technical accomplishment — playing chess really well — didn’t translate to real-world business problems and so produced little direct profit for I.B.M. In the mid ’00s, the company’s top executives were looking for another high-profile project that would provide a similar flood of global publicity. But this time, they wanted a “grand challenge” (as they call it internally), that would meet a real-world need. Question-answering seemed to be a good fit. In the last decade, question-answering systems have become increasingly important for firms dealing with mountains of documents. Legal firms, for example, need to quickly sift through case law to find a useful precedent or citation; help-desk workers often have to negotiate enormous databases of product information to find an answer for an agitated customer on the line. In situations like these, speed can often be of the essence; in the case of help desks, labor is billed by the minute, so high-tech firms with slender margins often lose their profits providing telephone support. How could I.B.M. push question-answering technology further?
magazine,When one I.B.M. executive suggested taking on “Jeopardy!” he was immediately pooh-poohed. Deep Blue was able to play chess well because the game is perfectly logical, with fairly simple rules; it can be reduced easily to math, which computers handle superbly. But the rules of language are much trickier. At the time, the very best question-answering systems — some created by software firms, some by university researchers — could sort through news articles on their own and answer questions about the content, but they understood only questions stated in very simple language (“What is the capital of Russia?”); in government-run competitions, the top systems answered correctly only about 70 percent of the time, and many were far worse. “Jeopardy!” with its witty, punning questions, seemed beyond their capabilities. What’s more, winning on “Jeopardy!” requires finding an answer in a few seconds. The top question-answering machines often spent longer, even entire minutes, doing the same thing. “The reaction was basically, ‘No, it’s too hard, forget it, no way can you do it,’ ” David Ferrucci told me not long ago. Ferrucci, I.B.M.’s senior manager for its Semantic Analysis and Integration department, heads the Watson project, and I met him for the first time last November at I.B.M.’s lab. An artificial-intelligence researcher who has long specialized in question-answering systems, Ferrucci chafed at the slow progress in the field. A fixture in the office in the evenings and on weekends, he is witty, voluble and intense. While dining out recently, his wife asked the waiter if Ferrucci’s meal included any dairy. “Is he lactose intolerant?” the waiter inquired.    “Yes,” his wife replied, “and just generally intolerable.” Ferrucci told me he was recently prescribed a mouth guard because the stress of watching Watson play had him clenching his teeth excessively.
magazine,Ferrucci was never an aficionado of “Jeopardy!” (“I’ve certainly seen it,” he said with a shrug. “I’m not a big fan.”) But he craved an ambitious goal that would impel him to break new ground, that would verge on science fiction, and this fit the bill. “The computer on ‘Star Trek’ is a question-answering machine,” he says. “It understands what you’re asking and provides just the right chunk of response that you needed. When is the computer going to get to a point where the computer knows how to talk to you? That’s my question.” What makes language so hard for computers, Ferrucci explained, is that it’s full of “intended meaning.” When people decode what someone else is saying, we can easily unpack the many nuanced allusions and connotations in every sentence. He gave me an example in the form of a “Jeopardy!” clue: “The name of this hat is elementary, my dear contestant.” People readily detect the wordplay here — the echo of “elementary, my dear Watson,” the famous phrase associated with Sherlock Holmes — and immediately recall that the Hollywood version of Holmes sports a deerstalker hat. But for a computer, there is no simple way to identify “elementary, my dear contestant” as wordplay. Cleverly matching different keywords, and even different fragments of the sentence — which in part is how most search engines work these days — isn’t enough, either. (Type that clue into Google, and you’ll get first-page referrals to “elementary, my dear watson” but none to deerstalker hats.)
magazine,What’s more, even if a computer determines that the actual underlying question is “What sort of hat does Sherlock Holmes wear?” its data may not be stored in such a way that enables it to extract a precise answer. For years, computer scientists built question-answering systems by creating specialized databases, in which certain facts about the world were recorded and linked together. You could do this with Sherlock Holmes by building a database that includes connections between catchphrases and his hat and his violin-playing. But that database would be pretty narrow; it wouldn’t be able to answer questions about nuclear power, or fish species, or the history of France. Those would require their own hand-made databases. Pretty soon you’d face the impossible task of organizing all the information known to man — of “boiling the ocean,” as Ferrucci put it. In computer science, this is known as a “bottleneck” problem. And even if you could get past it, you might then face the issue of “brittleness”: if your database contains only facts you input manually, it breaks any time you ask it a question about something beyond that material. There’s no way to hand-write a database that would include the answer to every “Jeopardy!” clue, because the subject matter is potentially all human knowledge.
magazine,The great shift in artificial intelligence began in the last 10 years, when computer scientists began using statistics to analyze huge piles of documents, like books and news stories. They wrote algorithms that could take any subject and automatically learn what types of words are, statistically speaking, most (and least) associated with it. Using this method, you could put hundreds of articles and books and movie reviews discussing Sherlock Holmes into the computer, and it would calculate that the words “deerstalker hat” and “Professor Moriarty” and “opium” are frequently correlated with one another, but not with, say, the Super Bowl. So at that point you could present the computer with a question that didn’t mention Sherlock Holmes by name, but if the machine detected certain associated words, it could conclude that Holmes was the probable subject — and it could also identify hundreds of other concepts and words that weren’t present but that were likely to be related to Holmes, like “Baker Street” and “chemistry.” In theory, this sort of statistical computation has been possible for decades, but it was impractical. Computers weren’t fast enough, memory wasn’t expansive enough and in any case there was no easy way to put millions of documents into a computer. All that changed in the early ’00s. Computer power became drastically cheaper, and the amount of online text exploded as millions of people wrote blogs and wikis about anything and everything; news organizations and academic journals also began putting all their works in digital format. What’s more, question-answering experts spent the previous couple of decades creating several linguistic tools that helped computers puzzle through language — like rhyming dictionaries, bulky synonym finders and “classifiers” that recognized the parts of speech.
magazine,Still, the era’s best question-answering systems remained nowhere near being able to take on “Jeopardy!” In 2006, Ferrucci tested I.B.M.’s most advanced system — it wasn’t the best in its field but near the top — by giving it 500 questions from previous shows. The results were dismal. He showed me a chart, prepared by I.B.M., of how real-life “Jeopardy!” champions perform on the TV show. They are clustered at the top in what Ferrucci calls “the winner’s cloud,” which consists of individuals who are the first to hit the buzzer about 50 percent of the time and, after having “won” the buzz, solve on average 85 to 95 percent of the clues. In contrast, the I.B.M. system languished at the bottom of the chart. It was rarely confident enough to answer a question, and when it was, it got the right answer only 15 percent of the time. Humans were fast and smart; I.B.M.’s machine was slow and dumb. “Humans are just — boom! — they’re just plowing through this in just seconds,” Ferrucci said excitedly. “They’re getting the questions, they’re breaking them down, they’re interpreting them, they’re getting the right interpretation, they’re looking this up in their memory, they’re scoring, they’re doing all this just instantly.” But Ferrucci argued that I.B.M. could be the one to finally play “Jeopardy!” If the firm focused its computer firepower — including its new “BlueGene” servers — on the challenge, Ferrucci could conduct experiments dozens of times faster than anyone had before, allowing him to feed more information into Watson and test new algorithms more quickly. Ferrucci was ambitious for personal reasons too: if he didn’t try this, another computer scientist might — “and then bang, you are irrelevant,” he told me.
magazine,“I had no interest spending the next five years of my life pursuing things in the small,” he said. “I wanted to push the limits.” If they could succeed at “Jeopardy!” soon after that they could bring the underlying technology to market as customizable question-answering systems. In 2007, his bosses gave him three to five years and increased his team to 15 people. FERRUCCI’S MAIN breakthrough was not the design of any single, brilliant new technique for analyzing language. Indeed, many of the statistical techniques Watson employs were already well known by computer scientists. One important thing that makes Watson so different is its enormous speed and memory. Taking advantage of I.B.M.’s supercomputing heft, Ferrucci’s team input millions of documents into Watson to build up its knowledge base — including, he says, “books, reference material, any sort of dictionary, thesauri, folksonomies, taxonomies, encyclopedias, any kind of reference material you can imagine getting your hands on or licensing. Novels, bibles, plays.” Watson’s speed allows it to try thousands of ways of simultaneously tackling a “Jeopardy!” clue. Most question-answering systems rely on a handful of algorithms, but Ferrucci decided this was why those systems do not work very well: no single algorithm can simulate the human ability to parse language and facts. Instead, Watson uses more than a hundred algorithms at the same time to analyze a question in different ways, generating hundreds of possible solutions. Another set of algorithms ranks these answers according to plausibility; for example, if dozens of algorithms working in different directions all arrive at the same answer, it’s more likely to be the right one. In essence, Watson thinks in probabilities. It produces not one single “right” answer, but an enormous number of possibilities, then ranks them by assessing how likely each one is to answer the question.
magazine,Ferrucci showed me how Watson handled this sample “Jeopardy!” clue: “He was presidentially pardoned on Sept. 8, 1974.” In the first pass, the algorithms came up with    “Nixon.” To evaluate whether “Nixon” was the best response, Watson performed a clever trick: it inserted the answer into the original phrase — “Nixon was presidentially pardoned on Sept. 8, 1974” — and then ran it as a new search, to see if it also produced results that supported “Nixon” as the right answer. (It did. The new search returned the result “Ford pardoned Nixon on Sept. 8, 1974,” a phrasing so similar to the original clue that it helped make “Nixon” the top-ranked solution.) Other times, Watson uses algorithms that can perform basic cross-checks against time or space to help detect which answer seems better. When the computer analyzed the clue “In 1594 he took a job as a tax collector in Andalusia,” the two most likely answers generated were “Thoreau” and    “Cervantes.” Watson assessed “Thoreau” and discovered his birth year was 1817, at which point the computer ruled him out, because he wasn’t alive in 1594. “Cervantes” became the top-ranked choice.
magazine,When Watson is playing a game, Ferrucci lets the audience peek into the computer’s analysis. A monitor shows Watson’s top five answers to a question, with a bar graph beside each indicating its confidence. During one of my visits, the host read the clue “Thousands of prisoners in the Philippines re-enacted the moves of the video of this Michael Jackson hit.” On the monitor, I could see that Watson’s top pick was    “Thriller,” with a confidence level of roughly 80 percent. This answer was correct, and Watson buzzed first, so it won $800. Watson’s next four choices — “Music video,” “Billie Jean,” “Smooth Criminal” and “MTV” — had only slivers for their bar graphs. It was a fascinating glimpse into the machine’s workings, because you could spy the connective thread running between the possibilities, even the wrong ones. “Billie Jean” and “Smooth Criminal” were also major hits by Michael Jackson, and “MTV” was the main venue for his videos. But it’s very likely that none of those correlated well with “Philippines.” After a year, Watson’s performance had moved halfway up to the “winner’s cloud.” By 2008, it had edged into the cloud; on paper, anyway, it could beat some of the lesser “Jeopardy!” champions. Confident they could actually compete on TV, I.B.M. executives called up Harry Friedman, the executive producer of “Jeopardy!” and raised the possibility of putting Watson on the air.
magazine,Friedman told me he and his fellow executives were surprised: nobody had ever suggested anything like this. But they quickly accepted the challenge. “Because it’s I.B.M., we took it seriously,” Friedman said. “They had the experience with Deep Blue and the chess match that became legendary.” WHEN THEY FIRST showed up to play Watson, many of the contestants worried that they didn’t stand a chance. Human memory is frail. In a high-stakes game like “Jeopardy!” players can panic, becoming unable to recall facts they would otherwise remember without difficulty. Watson doesn’t have this problem. It might have trouble with its analysis or be unable to logically connect a relevant piece of text to a question. But it doesn’t forget things. Plus, it has lightning-fast reactions — wouldn’t it simply beat the humans to the buzzer every time? “We’re relying on nerves — old nerves,” Dorothy Gilmartin complained, halfway through her first game, when it seemed that Watson was winning almost every buzz. Yet the truth is, in more than 20 games I witnessed between Watson and former “Jeopardy!” players, humans frequently beat Watson to the buzzer. Their advantage lay in the way the game is set up. On “Jeopardy!” when a new clue is given, it pops up on screen visible to all. (Watson gets the text electronically at the same moment.) But contestants are not allowed to hit the buzzer until the host is finished reading the question aloud; on average, it takes the host about six or seven seconds to read the clue.
magazine,Players use this precious interval to figure out whether or not they have enough confidence in their answers to hazard hitting the buzzer. After all, buzzing carries a risk: someone who wins the buzz on a $1,000 question but answers it incorrectly loses $1,000. Often those six or seven seconds weren’t enough time for Watson. The humans reacted more quickly. For example, in one game an $800 clue was “In Poland, pick up some kalafjor if you crave this broccoli relative.” A human contestant jumped on the buzzer as soon as he could. Watson, meanwhile, was still processing. Its top five answers hadn’t appeared on the screen yet. When these finally came up, I could see why it took so long. Something about the question had confused the computer, and its answers came with mere slivers of confidence. The top two were “vegetable” and “cabbage”; the correct answer — “cauliflower” — was the third guess. To avoid losing money — Watson doesn’t care about the money, obviously; winnings are simply a way for I.B.M. to see how fast and accurately its system is performing — Ferrucci’s team has programmed Watson generally not to buzz until it arrives at an answer with a high confidence level. In this regard, Watson is actually at a disadvantage, because the best “Jeopardy!” players regularly hit the buzzer as soon as it’s possible to do so, even if it’s before they’ve figured out the clue. “Jeopardy!” rules give them five seconds to answer after winning the buzz. So long as they have a good feeling in their gut, they’ll pounce on the buzzer, trusting that in those few extra seconds the answer will pop into their heads. Ferrucci told me that the best human contestants he had brought in to play against Watson were amazingly fast. “They can buzz in 10 milliseconds,” he said, sounding astonished. “Zero milliseconds!”
magazine,On the third day I watched Watson play, it did quite poorly, losing four of seven games, in one case without any winnings at all. Often Watson appeared to misunderstand the clue and offered answers so inexplicable that the audience erupted in laughter. Faced with the clue “This ‘insect’ of a gangster was a real-life hit man for Murder Incorporated in the 1930s & ’40s,” Watson responded with “James Cagney.” Up on the screen, I could see that none of its lesser choices were the correct one,    “Bugsy Siegel.” Later, when asked to complete the phrase “Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in Ka—,” Watson offered “not in Kansas anymore,” which was incorrect, since the precise phrasing was simply “Kansas anymore,” and “Jeopardy!” is strict about phrasings. When I looked at the screen, I noticed that the answers Watson had ranked lower were pretty odd, including “Steve Porcaro,” the keyboardist for the band Toto (which made a vague sort of sense), and “Jackie Chan” (which really didn’t). In another game, Watson’s logic appeared to fall down some odd semantic rabbit hole, repeatedly giving the answer “Tommy Lee Jones” — the name of the Hollywood actor — to several clues that had nothing to do with him. In the corner of the conference room, Ferrucci sat typing into a laptop. Whenever Watson got a question wrong, Ferrucci winced and stamped his feet in frustration, like a college-football coach watching dropped passes. “This is torture,” he added, laughing.
magazine,Seeing Watson’s errors, you can sometimes get a sense of its cognitive shortcomings. For example, in “Jeopardy!” the category heading often includes a bit of wordplay that explains how the clues are to be addressed. Watson sometimes appeared to mistakenly analyze the entire category and thus botch every clue in it. One game included the category “Stately Botanical Gardens,” which indicated that every clue would list several gardens, and the answer was the relevant state. Watson clearly didn’t grasp this; it answered “botanic garden” repeatedly. I also noticed that when Watson was faced with very short clues — ones with only a word or two — it often seemed to lose the race to the buzzer, possibly because the host read the clues so quickly that Watson didn’t have enough time to do its full calculations. The humans, in contrast, simply trusted their guts and jumped. Ferrucci refused to talk on the record about Watson’s blind spots. He’s aware of them; indeed, his team does “error analysis” after each game, tracing how and why Watson messed up. But he is terrified that if competitors knew what types of questions Watson was bad at, they could prepare by boning up in specific areas. I.B.M. required all its sparring-match contestants to sign nondisclosure agreements prohibiting them from discussing their own observations on what, precisely, Watson was good and bad at. I signed no such agreement, so I was free to describe what I saw; but Ferrucci wasn’t about to make it easier for me by cataloguing Watson’s vulnerabilities.
magazine,Computer scientists I spoke to agreed that witty, allusive clues will probably be Watson’s weak point. “Retrieval of obscure Italian poets is easy — [Watson] will never forget that one,” Peter Norvig, the director of research at Google, told me. “But ‘Jeopardy!’ tends to have a lot of wordplay, and that’s going to be a challenge.” Certainly on many occasions this seemed to be true. Still, at other times I was startled by Watson’s eerily humanlike ability to untangle astonishingly coy clues. During one game, a category was “All-Eddie Before & After,” indicating that the clue would hint at two different things that need to be blended together, one of which included the name    “Eddie.” The $2,000 clue was “A ‘Green Acres’ star goes existential (& French) as the author of ‘The Fall.’ ” Watson nailed it perfectly: “Who is Eddie Albert Camus?” Ultimately, Watson’s greatest edge at “Jeopardy!” probably isn’t its perfect memory or lightning speed. It is the computer’s lack of emotion. “Managing your emotions is an enormous part of doing well” on “Jeopardy!” Bob Harris, a five-time champion, told me. “Every single time I’ve ever missed a Daily Double, I always miss the next clue, because I’m still kicking myself.” Because there is only a short period before the next clue comes along, the stress can carry over. Similarly, humans can become much more intimidated by a $2,000 clue than a $200 one, because the more expensive clues are presumably written to be much harder.
magazine,Whether Watson will win when it goes on TV in a real “Jeopardy!” match depends on whom “Jeopardy!” pits against the computer. Watson will not appear as a contestant on the regular show; instead, “Jeopardy!” will hold a special match pitting Watson against one or more famous winners from the past. If the contest includes Ken Jennings — the best player in “Jeopardy!” history, who won 74 games in a row in 2004 — Watson will lose if its performance doesn’t improve. It’s pretty far up in the winner’s cloud, but it’s not yet at Jennings’s level; in the sparring matches, Watson was beaten several times by opponents who did nowhere near as well as Jennings. (Indeed, it sometimes lost to people who hadn’t placed first in their own appearances on the show.) The show’s executive producer, Harry Friedman, will not say whom it is picking to play against Watson, but he refused to let Jennings be interviewed for this story, which is suggestive. Ferrucci says his team will continue to fine-tune Watson, but improving its performance is getting harder. “When we first started, we’d add a new algorithm and it would improve the performance by 10 percent, 15 percent,” he says. “Now it’ll be like half a percent is a good improvement.”
magazine,Ferrucci’s attitude toward winning is conflicted. I could see that he hungers to win. And losing badly on national TV might mean negative publicity for I.B.M. But Ferrucci also argued that Watson might lose merely because of bad luck. Should one of Watson’s opponents land on both Daily Doubles, for example, that player might double his or her money and vault beyond Watson’s ability to catch up, even if the computer never flubs another question. Ultimately, Ferrucci claimed not to worry about winning or losing. He told me he’s happy that I.B.M. has simply pushed this far and produced a system that performs so well at answering questions. Even a televised flameout, he said, won’t diminish the street cred Watson will give I.B.M. in the computer-science field. “I don’t really care about ‘Jeopardy!’ ” he told me, shrugging. I.B.M. PLANS TObegin selling versions of Watson to companies in the next year or two. John Kelly, the head of I.B.M.’s research labs, says that Watson could help decision-makers sift through enormous piles of written material in seconds. Kelly says that its speed and quality could make it part of rapid-fire decision-making, with users talking to Watson to guide their thinking process.
magazine,“I want to create a medical version of this,” he adds. “A Watson M.D., if you will.” He imagines a hospital feeding Watson every new medical paper in existence, then having it answer questions during split-second emergency-room crises. “The problem right now is the procedures, the new procedures, the new medicines, the new capability is being generated faster than physicians can absorb on the front lines and it can be deployed.” He also envisions using Watson to produce virtual call centers, where the computer would talk directly to the customer and generally be the first line of defense, because, “as you’ve seen, this thing can answer a question faster and more accurately than most human beings.” “I want to create something that I can take into every other retail industry, in the transportation industry, you name it, the banking industry,” Kelly goes on to say. “Any place where time is critical and you need to get advanced state-of-the-art information to the front of decision-makers. Computers need to go from just being back-office calculating machines to improving the intelligence of people making decisions.” At first, a Watson system could cost several million dollars, because it needs to run on at least one $1 million I.B.M. server. But Kelly predicts that within 10 years an artificial brain like Watson could run on a much cheaper server, affordable by any small firm, and a few years after that, on a laptop.
magazine,Ted Senator, a vice president of SAIC — a high-tech firm that frequently helps design government systems — is a former “Jeopardy!” champion and has followed Watson’s development closely; in October he visited I.B.M. and played against Watson himself. (He lost.) He says that Watson-level artificial intelligence could make it significantly easier for citizens to get answers quickly from massive, ponderous bureaucracies. He points to the recent “cash for clunkers” program. He tried to participate, but when he went to the government site to see if his car qualified, he couldn’t figure it out: his model, a 1995 Saab 9000, was listed twice, each time with different mileage-per-gallon statistics. What he needed was probably buried deep inside some government database, but the bureaucrats hadn’t presented the information clearly enough. “So I gave up,” he says. This is precisely the sort of task a Watson-like artificial intelligence can assist in, he says. “You can imagine if I’m applying for health insurance, having to explain the details of my personal situation, or if I’m trying to figure out if I’m eligible for a particular tax deduction. Any place there’s massive data that surpasses the human’s ability to sort through it, and there’s a time constraint on getting an answer.”
magazine,Many experts imagine even quirkier ways that everyday life might be transformed as question-answering technology becomes more powerful and widespread. Andrew Hickl, the C.E.O. of Language Computer Corporation, which makes question-answering systems, among other things, for businesses, was recently asked by a client to make a “contradiction engine”: if you tell it a statement, it tries to find evidence on the Web that contradicts it. “It’s like, ‘I believe that Dallas is the most beautiful city in the United States,’ and I want to find all the evidence on the Web that contradicts that.” (It produced results that were only 70 percent relevant, which satisfied his client.) Hickl imagines people using this sort of tool to read through the daily news. “We could take something that Harry Reid says and immediately figure out what contradicts it. Or somebody tweets something that’s wrong, and we could automatically post a tweet saying, ‘No, actually, that’s wrong, and here’s proof.’ ” CULTURALLY, OF COURSE, advances like Watson are bound to provoke nervous concerns too. High-tech critics have begun to wonder about the wisdom of relying on artificial-intelligence systems in the face of complex reality. Many Wall Street firms, for example, now rely on “millisecond trading” computers, which detect deviations in prices and order trades far faster than humans ever could; but these are now regarded as a possible culprit in the seemingly irrational hourlong stock-market plunge of the spring. Would doctors in an E.R. feel comfortable taking action based on a split-second factual answer from a Watson M.D.? And while service companies can clearly save money by relying more on question-answering systems, they are precisely the sort of labor-saving advance deplored by unions — and customers who crave the ability to talk to a real, intelligent human on the phone.
magazine,Some scientists, moreover, argue that Watson has serious limitations that could hamper its ability to grapple with the real world. It can analyze texts and draw basic conclusions from the facts it finds, like figuring out if one event happened later than another. But many questions we want answered require more complex forms of analysis. Last year, the computer scientist Stephen Wolfram released “Wolfram Alpha,” a question-answering engine that can do mathematical calculations about the real world. Ask it to “compare the populations of New York City and Cincinnati,” for example, and it will not only give you their populations — 8.4 million versus 333,336 — it will also create a bar graph comparing them visually and calculate their ratio (25.09 to 1) and the percentage relationship between them (New York is 2,409 percent larger). But this sort of automated calculation is only possible because Wolfram and his team spent years painstakingly hand-crafting databases in a fashion that enables a computer to perform this sort of analysis — by typing in the populations of New York and Cincinnati, for example, and tagging them both as “cities” so that the engine can compare them. This, Wolfram says, is the deep challenge of artificial intelligence: a lot of human knowledge isn’t represented in words alone, and a computer won’t learn that stuff just by encoding English language texts, as Watson does. The only way to program a computer to do this type of mathematical reasoning might be to do precisely what Ferrucci doesn’t want to do — sit down and slowly teach it about the world, one fact at a time.
magazine,“Not to take anything away from this ‘Jeopardy!’ thing, but I don’t think Watson really is answering questions — it’s not like the ‘Star Trek’ computer,” Wolfram says. (Of course, Wolfram Alpha cannot answer the sort of broad-ranging trivia questions that Watson can, either, because Wolfram didn’t design it for that purpose.) What’s more, Watson can answer only questions asking for an objectively knowable fact. It cannot produce an answer that requires judgment. It cannot offer a new, unique answer to questions like “What’s the best high-tech company to invest in?” or “When will there be peace in the Middle East?” All it will do is look for source material in its database that appears to have addressed those issues and then collate and compose a string of text that seems to be a statistically likely answer. Neither Watson nor Wolfram Alpha, in other words, comes close to replicating human wisdom. At best, Ferrucci suspects that Watson might be simulating, in a stripped-down fashion, some of the ways that our human brains process language. Modern neuroscience has found that our brain is highly “parallel”: it uses many different parts simultaneously, harnessing billions of neurons whenever we talk or listen to words. “I’m no cognitive scientist, so this is just speculation,” Ferrucci says, but Watson’s approach — tackling a question in thousands of different ways — may succeed precisely because it mimics the same approach. Watson doesn’t come up with an answer to a question so much as make an educated guess, based on similarities to things it has been exposed to. “I have young children, you can see them guessing at the meaning of words, you can see them guessing at grammatical structure,” he notes.
magazine,This is why Watson often seemed most human not when it was performing flawlessly but when it wasn’t. Many of the human opponents found the computer most endearing when it was clearly misfiring — misinterpreting the clue, making weird mistakes, rather as we do when we’re put on the spot. During one game, the category was, coincidentally, “I.B.M.” The questions seemed like no-brainers for the computer (for example, “Though it’s gone beyond the corporate world, I.B.M. stands for this” — “International Business Machines”). But for some reason, Watson performed poorly. It came up with answers that were wrong or in which it had little confidence. The audience, composed mostly of I.B.M. employees who had come to watch the action, seemed mesmerized by the spectacle. Then came the final, $2,000 clue in the category: “It’s the last name of father and son Thomas Sr. and Jr., who led I.B.M. for more than 50 years.” This time the computer pounced. “Who is Watson?” it declared in its synthesized voice, and the crowd erupted in cheers. At least it knew its own name.

nyregion,A ‘Women Only’ Restroom Renovation Tips the Balance at Grand Central - The New York Times Feminist lore is full of stories of the times when women’s rooms were lacking — near the United States Senate floor until the 1990s, near the House floor until the 1960s, in the Supreme Court justice robing room until 1993. But now the dynamic has flipped, at least in a quaint little nook of Grand Central Terminal. The officials of Metro-North Railroad are formally acknowledging that when it comes to bathrooms, separate but equal is not really equal at all: Women need more. The city signaled as much in 2005, when the City Council and the mayor approved legislation requiring arenas, theaters and nightclubs to have a female-to-male restroom facilities ratio of two to one. So while there are still men’s rooms elsewhere in the terminal, the restrooms in the waiting area, which reopened this week after several months of renovations, are now for women only. “There would always be a line here,” said Lois Jason of Hamden, Conn., who had sometimes used the men’s room when she was really desperate. “I would remember telling my husband to stand at the door and not let any guys in.” “We’ve never had problems backing up in the men’s room,” said Frank Ozimek, a general station master, who for years has observed women’s lines spilling into the waiting room.
nyregion,The bathroom lines in Grand Central Terminal have been growing especially tedious in the last decade as the station has become a destination for its shopping and its food court. “We have 750,000 people coming in here every day,” said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North. Ms. Anders conducted a tour of Grand Central Terminal restroom facilities during the peak lunch period. And indeed, at every women’s room, there was a line extending out the door, with women waiting patiently, chatting with friends or talking on cellphones. Meanwhile, the men breezed in and out of their bathrooms, nary a queue in sight. “There is absolutely no cause for men to complain that we’ve made it all women’s restrooms upstairs,” Ms. Anders said. She also noted that the Grand Central Terminal bathrooms had been nominated as America’s best public restroom (voting is online at bestrestroom.com until July 31). They are done in the architectural style of Grand Central Terminal itself, with Botticino marble walls, seamless terrazzo flooring, Stony Creek granite partitions and mirrors with scalloped edges. “It’s, like, amazing,” said Lisa Kovitz, who commutes into Grand Central Terminal every day from Ossining, N.Y., and discovered the bathroom this week. “You could hear angels singing, it was so nice.” Of course, the bathrooms are also equipped with extremely loud high-powered hand dryers. “You could dry your hair on that thing,” one man in the waiting room mumbled as the sound of the dryers blasted through the space.
nyregion,To emphasize that the men were not being shortchanged, Ms. Anders pointed out that the men’s rooms were equally nice, outfitted with the granite and the marble. There is one downside to the men’s rooms, she said: “They also, believe it or not, have fewer sinks.” In the waiting room, the signs for the restrooms occasionally caused double takes. One door says, “Women.” The other door says, “Women.” But in case anyone missed the point, there is another sign that says, “Women Only.” Eric Nadler, 21, of Mahopac, N.Y., stopped short as he walked toward the restroom. “I just walked here, and there’s no men’s bathroom,” he said with a confused look. He looked around and asked, “Do you know where there’s a men’s bathroom?” Downstairs, he was informed. That is, down the escalators, where there is both a women’s room (often with a line) and a men’s room (almost never with a line). Or alternately, he could ask the station master to buzz him into the “family” bathroom. He opted to go downstairs.
sports/baseball,In Washington, Baseball as It Once Was - The New York Times WASHINGTON — On Oct. 7, 1933, a crowd of 28,454 packed Griffith Stadium to watch the Washington Senators take on the visiting New York Giants in Game 5 of the World Series. In the 10th inning that Saturday afternoon, Mel Ott hit a home run to deep center field against the right-hander Jack Russell to guide the Giants to a 4-3, Series-clinching victory. That was the last time a postseason baseball game was played in the nation’s capital. The next will come Wednesday afternoon — 79 years and 3 days later — when the Washington Nationals host the St. Louis Cardinals at 1:07 p.m. in Game 3 of their National League division series. Naturally, there was an air of expectation Tuesday afternoon at Nationals Park as the teams worked out under an overcast sky. “I think all of us in this room are very excited for it,” said Ryan Zimmerman, who made his debut with the Nationals in 2005, the team’s first season in Washington. “We’re all excited to go out there tomorrow in front of our fans, and in front of a full stadium of Nationals fans, finally, and see what it’s like.” The Nationals players and coaches went out of their way to note the support of their fans, a base that has grown and developed in the last eight seasons. This year, the team drew an average of 29,269 per game to Nationals Park, its highest average home attendance since 2005, when it drew 33,728 a game at R.F.K. Stadium. The interim years were marked by much smaller crowds, often with large numbers of opposing fans. But that has changed.
sports/baseball,“You know, we got rid of the Philly fans and started taking up more of the space ourselves,” Manager Davey Johnson said Tuesday. “It’s been great. The guys really enjoy playing here. We love the city and we love the ballpark and we love the fans.” There has been some complaining this week about Wednesday’s afternoon start time, but it will serve as an inadvertent nod to history, the years before flood lights and prime-time games. And the first pitch will be preceded by some military-themed pageantry, including an Armed Forces color guard, a flyover by the District of Columbia Air National Guard, and a presentation of the game ball by Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the United States Army chief of staff. Frank Robinson, the Nationals’ first manager, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. Then Charlie Brotman, the stadium announcer who bridged two earlier versions of the team in Washington during his tenure from 1956 to 1971, will declare, “Play ball.” “There’s a lot of buzz and a lot of energy in the city, and I think they’re ready to take it to the next level,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said.
technology,Facing Free Software, Microsoft Looks to Yahoo - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO  — Nearly a quarter-century ago, the mantra “information wants to be free” heralded an era in which news, entertainment and personal communications would flow at no charge over the Internet. Now comes a new rallying cry: software wants to be free. Or, as the tech insiders say, it wants to be “zero dollar.” A growing number of consumers are paying just that  —  nothing. This is the Internet’s latest phase: people using freely distributed applications, from e-mail and word processing programs to spreadsheets, games and financial management tools. They run on distant, massive and shared data centers, and users of the services pay with their attention to ads, not cash. While such services have  been emerging for years, their rapid adoption has been an important but largely overlooked driver of the $44.6 billion hostile  bid that Microsoft made to take over Yahoo this week. That proposed deal would give Microsoft access to Yahoo’s vast news, information, search and advertising network — and the ability to compete more squarely with Google. But a merger would also allow Microsoft to adapt its empire to compete in a world of low-cost  Internet-centered software. Yahoo’s huge user base could provide the audience and the infrastructure for Microsoft to change how it distributes its products and charges for them.
technology,“Microsoft makes its money selling licenses to millions and millions of people who install it on individual hard drives,” said Nicholas Carr, a former editor at The Harvard Business Review and author of “The Big Switch,” a book about the transition to what the technology industry calls cloud computing. “Most of what you need is on the Internet —  and it’s free,” he said. “There are early warning signs that the traditional Microsoft programs are losing their grip.” Certainly, analysts said, Microsoft’s revenue — $51 billion last year, most of it from software — is not yet suffering in any meaningful way. The company said, to the contrary, that business is booming, and that Microsoft Office, a flagship product, is having a record-breaking year. “Last year was our best year, and this year is better,” said Chris Capossela, a Microsoft vice president with the  Office division. At the same time, though, the company has lowered prices. Last year it began selling its $120 student-teacher edition to mainstream consumers, who had been asked to pay more than $300 for a similar product. The bulk of the company’s profit comes from selling to corporations, which unlike consumers may be slower to adapt to a system in which proprietary data is not stored in corporate-owned data centers. Microsoft said that corporate customers prefer using software that they are familiar with and that provides more functions and better security. But the corporate business, too, is coming under increasing assault from lower-cost Internet competitors, including Microsoft’s archnemesis, Google.
technology,On Thursday, Google took its attack to a new level. It released Google Apps Team Edition — a version of its productivity software that includes word processing, spreadsheet and calendar programs. In a form of guerrilla marketing, the fans of Google Docs can take it into the office, bypassing or perhaps influencing decisions made by corporate executives, who until now have overwhelmingly bought Microsoft software. Google, while it gives such software free to consumers, charges corporations for a premium edition, though the  fee is  less than what Microsoft charges for productivity software, analysts said. The change is coming not from corporations but on the computers of a growing base of individuals who increasingly expect their software to be free — and for it to be processed and managed over the Internet. Kevin Twohy, 20, a mathematics student at U.C.L.A., uses a free service on Facebook to store and share photos, a program called Picnik to edit the images, and Gmail. For his English class last semester, he wrote a term paper about William Blake using Google’s free word processing software, even though Microsoft Office had come loaded on his personal computer. The advantage of the Google program, he said, was that it allowed him to keep his information on Google’s servers so that it was accessible at any computer,  whether he was working at his fraternity, a coffee shop, a campus computer bank or the library. The experience, he said, has persuaded him not to pay money for software.
technology,“I don’t ever see myself buying a copy of Office,” he said. Those individual users may be able to do what an army of lawyers and regulators in the United States and Europe have never been able to do — rein in Microsoft’s monopoly power. There is some evidence that the erosion in its pricing power has already begun. Last fall, Microsoft lowered prices of its most powerful productivity software for students, whom it regards as important future customers. For a limited time, it said, students could buy a $60 downloadable version of its most feature-rich version of Office, which ordinarily costs around $460. Microsoft has also had ad-supported online competitors who have challenged other prominent brands, like the Encarta encyclopedia and Microsoft Money, personal finance management software. “If Microsoft had to start over today, it wouldn’t even think about charging money for its software,” said Yun Kim, an industry analyst with Pacific Growth Equities. “Nobody in their right mind is developing a business in the consumer market to charge” for software. Mr. Kim said that he expected Microsoft at some point to introduce a free ad-supported version of Office for consumers, though the company insists that  it has no such intention. Mr. Kim, however, expects that Microsoft’s corporate business is more entrenched and resilient, and less susceptible to the influences of free or ad-supported cloud computing. Microsoft’s  online competitors disagree. Among them is Zimbra, a division of Yahoo that offers Internet-centered productivity software  for e-mail, word processing and spreadsheets.
technology,Consumers pay nothing for the product, but corporations pay as much as $50 a  year per license. About 20,000 companies, most of them small, are paying customers. For Office software, Microsoft charges $75 a year per license to large companies, and up to $300 for small companies, according to Forrester Research. Satish Dharmaraj, general manager of Zimbra, said the company could undercut Microsoft  because it costs far less to create, maintain, fix and upgrade software that runs in a central data center instead of on thousands of individual computers. But the relative quality of Microsoft’s software continues to attract customers, argued J. P. Gownder, an industry analyst with Forrester Research. He said that Microsoft has an opportunity to develop a hybrid version of its software  that combines the convenience of cloud computing with the security of processing on the desktop, thus helping it maintain and further its empire. “This is the predominant reason why Microsoft has gone after Yahoo,” Mr. Gownder said. “The ad revenue is a nice short-term achievement, but in the long run it is much more about delivering apps over the Web.”
arts/design,Contemporary Art Sales: What a Difference a Year Makes - The New York Times The numbers tell a clear enough story. Last week, Christie’s and Sotheby’s evening auctions of contemporary art in New York — the events by which the wider world takes the temperature of the art market — raised a total of $560.6 million. Last year, the equivalent auctions took in $1 billion. And the $78.1 million total from Christie’s quirkily themed May 8 auction of contemporary works, “Bound to Fail,” was a fraction of the $705.9 million the company grossed last May at its blockbuster 20th-century “Looking Forward to Tomorrow” sale. Phillips’s $46.6 million sale of 20th-century and contemporary art at its May 8 evening sale was also way down on the $127.9 million it generated from contemporary art 12 months ago. “The market has definitely shrunk,” said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser in New York. “But that isn’t a result of sellers not wanting to sell in an uncertain market, but of a lack of spectacular guarantees” that flush out the best works. “There’s a cause and effect,” she added, explaining the absence of big-ticket works in last week’s auctions. With Christie’s and Sotheby’s more mindful of the bottom line than they were in 2015, upfront offers to sellers were reined in and no work was valued at more than $40 million.
arts/design,Still, given the climate of uncertainty, the auction houses had some reasons for optimism. On May 10, Christie’s sold a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting for $57.3 million, an auction high for the artist, and the following evening Sotheby’s, which has seen an exodus of expertise since its surprise acquisition in January of the New York firm Art Agency, Partners, reassured investors with a seemingly solid total of $242.2 million, with 95 percent of the lots selling. Beyond the numbers, here are some of the week’s main themes. The absence of a Picasso or Modigliani guaranteed at $100 million not only shrunk the top line, but also exposed a shortage of quality in the “Imps & Mods” market. Sotheby’s and Christie’s evening sales in this once-dominant category brought in a combined $286 million, half what the houses raised last May. “There just isn’t the quality left out there any more. All the great pictures are in museums,” said the London dealer Alan Hobart, who was at Christie’s Impressionist and modern evening sale on May 12 to see a square 1919 Monet, once part of a rectangular waterlily canvas, sell for $27 million, the top Impressionist price of the week. Pre-1950s gems still come up for auction, but they tend to be tucked away among the day sale works on paper. On May at Sotheby’s, for example, the powerful 1907 Picasso pencil drawing “Tete de femme,” once owned by Gertrude Stein, sold above the high estimate for $490,000.
arts/design,And on Friday at Christie’s, a circa 1910 Modigliani pencil drawing, “Tete de cariatide,” was pushed by at least half a dozen bidders to $1.6 million, more than double the high estimate. There were few standout trophies in the contemporary sales. Predictably, plenty of attention was generated by the presence of one of four versions of Maurizio Cattelan’s 2001 “HIM” — a waxwork of Hitler reimagined as a kneeling schoolboy — in Christie’s “Bound to Fail” auction. The sculpture had been entered, without a guarantee, by the hedge fund manager David Ganek with what had seemed to be an ambitious estimate of $10 million to $15 million. But at least three bidders pushed the price up to $17.2 million, an auction high for the artist. There was immediate speculation that the mystery buyer might be the auction house’s owner, Francois Pinault, who in 2009 sold the version he owned. Mr. Pinault’s office said by email that he was not the buyer. The week’s top result was undoubtedly the $57.3 million paid on May 10 at Christie’s by the Japanese Internet billionaire Yusaku Maezawa for the monumental 1982 Basquiat canvas, “Untitled,” featuring a self-portrait as a horned devil. Entered by the New York dealer-collector Adam Lindemann, and certain to sell for at least $40 million, courtesy of a third-party guarantee, this much-vaunted painting — and its price — indicated to many that contemporary art is far from slumping into a true “down” market.
arts/design,Mr. Maezawa, 40, is the founder of the online fashion mall Zozotown and is hoping to open a private museum. He spent almost $98 million on contemporary art last week. “They were lucky to get that Japanese client; otherwise, it could have been a different story,” said Judith Selkowitz, another adviser in New York. “But the fact is there’s still a lot of money around. Buyers are just a lot more selective. It’s good to rebalance, and it’s healthy that everything isn’t running away.” The challenge for the action houses is to convert the hundreds of millions the wealthy spend on contemporary art into profits for themselves. The $242.2 million with fees that Sotheby’s took from its 44-lot sale on May 11 — against a low estimate of $201.4 million — seemed on paper to be a success. The total was 24 percent less than the $318.4 million achieved by Christie’s the previous night, compared with the 42 percent gap in market share at the sales last year. Sotheby’s was the sole guarantor of just five lots, with a total minimum value of $15.5 million, and all found buyers. But four works in the sale had been entered by the hedge fund manager Daniel Sundheim as part payment for a Cy Twombly “blackboard” painting he had bought for $70.5 million at Sotheby’s back in November, Bloomberg reported. One of them, Twombly’s “Untitled (Bacchus 1st Version V)” from 2004, sold for $15.4 million, but it had been estimated at $20 million, and another, a 1990 Christopher Wool word-painting fell to a single bid from Mr. Maezawa at $13.9 million, again below expectations.
arts/design,The arrangement with Mr. Sundheim reflects Sotheby’s willingness to expand into art-related financial services, and for the moment, investors seem to approve of this strategy. At the end of trading on Tuesday Sotheby’s stock was priced at $27.74, significant recovery from the $19.13 that it plumbed in February. “They weren’t great sales, but in terms of the percentages sold, they did well,” said the London dealer James Holland-Hibbert, who noted a new sobriety in the auction market for 20th- and 21st-century art. “It’s quite old-fashioned, really,” Mr. Holland-Hibbert added. “The good things sell for good prices.”
books/review,King Lear in Bombay - The New York Times FAMILY MATTERS By Rohinton Mistry. 434 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $26. ROHINTON MISTRY, his publisher informs us, ''was born in Bombay and now lives near Toronto.'' He has published three novels, counting this one, and has three times been a finalist for the Booker Prize, a competition limited -- for the time being, at least -- to British and Commonwealth nationals. ''Family Matters'' lines up well alongside its predecessors, ''A Fine Balance'' and ''Such a Long Journey,'' and seems well favored to win the 2002 prize on October 22, when the contest is decided. Not surprisingly, the country in which Mistry has resided since 1975 regards him as one of theirs, as echt a Canadian as, say, Michael Ondaatje. Globalization is not just a big business phenomenon. Fiction too is now a project sans frontières, and in this literary free market, the subcontinent excels. There has emerged a premier division of its novelists, writing in English for a supranational readership: Salman Rushdie (winner of the Booker for ''Midnight's Children'' and currently a New Yorker), Arundhati Roy (who has, for the time being, given up fiction for political action in her home country), Anita Desai (whose most recent novel, ''Fasting, Feasting,'' delicately explored Indo-American love-hate relations) and Vikram Seth (author of ''The Golden Gate'' and ''A Suitable Boy''). Less well known, but gaining fast, are other members of Britain's East Asian literary diaspora, writers like Romesh Gunesekera, Sunetra Gupta, Abdulrazak Gurnah and Ardashir Vakil.
books/review,Why, one might ask, is there such a wealth of Indo-Pakistani-Bangladeshi-Sri- Lankan writers? All over the English-speaking world, postcolonialist conferences, dissertations and graduate seminars are surely pondering that question. And Mistry's latest novel will only add to the debate. ''Family Matters'' is a title pregnant with significance. Ostensibly, the subject is domestic: family affairs. But the book also poses a larger question: Does family matter in the modern age? Particularly in the increasingly strife-torn extended family that is India? Nariman Vakeel, a 79-year-old Parsi patriarch and former professor of English literature, is dying, lingeringly, of Parkinson's disease. As the novel opens, he has become bedridden after breaking his ankle in a fall. Nariman has bequeathed separate apartments to the two branches of his family. His stepchildren, Jal and Coomy, occupy the larger, in a building called Chateau Felicity. His daughter and son-in-law and their two children live in a smaller apartment in a block named Pleasant Villa. Despite their cheery names, both establishments are decaying. So too are the bonds of kinship within them. One household is reluctant to care for ''Pappa'' as he slowly expires; the other is hardly equipped for the task. As Nariman ruefully observes, the setup is reminiscent of ''King Lear'' -- Bombay style. As he wastes away, the secrets of Nariman's early life unfold. Forty years before, as an eligible, secularly inclined young intellectual in newly independent India, he had wanted to marry a Goan Christian. Reluctantly, and with tragic consequences, Nariman succumbed to family pressure and took instead a Parsi widow (with two children) to wife.
books/review,Gradually, we witness the process by which the second generation of the family is corrupted, both by Nariman's reluctant decision to marry and by his terminal -- but seemingly interminably long-lasting -- illness. His clever young grandson starts taking bribes at school, helping classmates cheat in order to earn money to care for Nariman. And his son-in-law, Yezad, embarks on an elaborate and criminal scheme to engineer a promotion and a higher salary for himself. The two stepchildren dishonestly fabricate damage to their apartment to supply an excuse for not taking Nariman back. All this unfolds against a mid-1990's Bombay that is itself stewing in corruption. Is the city being destroyed by sectarianism (principally engineered by the Hindu ultranationalist Shiv Sena faction) or by the general push and pull of a bustling, heterogeneous society? What is the solution? Obedience to the Mahatma's supra-sectarian ideal of one India, or a return to the parochial loyalties of ethnic subgroup, caste, clan and family? Mistry's novel gives no easy answer. Clearly, he is not wholly infatuated by what Rushdie has called ''the city of mixed-up, mongrel joy.'' Occasionally, Mistry celebrates Bombay's cultural diversity, as in this lyric description of a street vendor's wares: ''The bhel-puri stall was a sculptured landscape with its golden pyramid of sev, the little snow mountains of mumra, hillocks of puris, and, in among their valleys, in aluminium containers, pools of green and brown and red chutneys.'' But the more pervasive image of the city is of gangsterism, cronyism, impervious bureaucracy, destitution and decay -- a landscape of ''crumbling plaster, perforated water tanks and broken drain pipes.'' This is an India to escape from, not an India to reform.
books/review,As the narrative progresses, the focus of ''Family Matters'' shifts from Nariman to Yezad. Nariman's son-in-law is manager of the Bombay Sporting Goods Emporium, a store owned by a good-hearted, ecumenical Hindu, Mr. Kapur. But Mr. Kapur is destined to die -- cricket bat in hand -- while fending off a couple of Shiv Sena enforcers who have demanded that he call his establishment the Mumbai Sporting Goods Emporium, reflecting the Hindu name of the city. Before they stab him to death, he will threaten to ''knock their heads for a sixer,'' the cricket equivalent of slugging a home run. How should one interpret this episode? Is it satirical, farcical or nostalgic? What does that cricket bat (and the associated ideals of fair play) represent? Colonial false consciousness or inherent decency? ''Family Matters'' ends with an epilogue set five years after the main action. Yezad, who once yearned to be ''a little Englishman of a type that even England did not have,'' has returned to Parsi ideals and principles with a vengeance. He is now a Persian of a type that Persia may never have had. He is also a family man who enforces his renewed faith with iron severity.
books/review,For readers as uninstructed as myself, it would help to bone up on the Parsi religion before getting too far into the novel. Followers of the prophet Zarathustra (''Zoroaster,'' we learn, only in the epilogue, is a ''Greek perversion'') went into exile in India in the eighth century, after the Muslim conquest of Persia. Those that remained in Persia were forcibly converted to Islam. Indian Parsi religion revolves around the fire temple, whose ever-burning flame is fed by ritual donations of sandalwood from the faithful. Parsi dead are left in the open air to be devoured by vultures rather than offered up to the Ganges, as are Hindu cadavers. Never numerous, the Parsis were esteemed by the British during the period of the Raj, particularly for what was seen as their extraordinary skill in the English language. It is a quality that seems to have flourished in the Parsi diaspora; certainly it shines, as brightly as any sacred flame, in this fine but disturbing novel.
us,Nina Pham, Free of Ebola, Makes White House Detour on Way Home - The New York Times Nina Pham, a 26-year-old nurse who became infected with Ebola while caring for a Liberian patient, walked out of a Maryland hospital on Friday, thanked God and others for her recovery, then went to the White House for a hug from President Obama before her return home to Dallas. Jubilantly declaring that “hope just went up a notch today,” Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said that Ms. Pham was virus free after her release from the Institute’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. In brief remarks, Ms. Pham, the first person infected with Ebola in the United States, beamed as she thanked God, her family and her friends. Flanked by her sister and her mother, she called the infection “very stressful and challenging,” and said she was looking forward to reuniting with her dog, Bentley, who officials in Texas had indicated was also virus free. “I believe in the power of prayer, because I know so many people all over the world have been praying for me,” Ms. Pham said. Ms. Pham said she was especially grateful to Dr. Kent Brantly, an American physician and an Ebola survivor, who donated plasma as part of her care. She contracted the disease while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan of Liberia, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Mr. Duncan died on Oct. 8.
us,Some scientists believe that the blood of people who survive Ebola can be useful in treating those infected with the virus, but Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was “virtually impossible” to say whether the donated plasma led directly to Ms. Pham’s recovery. He said the two factors that did appear to play a role in her recovery were that she was young and healthy, and that she was able to get intensive care soon after being infected. Dr. Fauci said that it might take some time for Ms. Pham to recover her full strength, but that she was now free to return to Texas and “resume a normal, healthy and happy life.” As Ms. Pham was being released from the hospital in Bethesda, Emory University Hospital in Atlanta announced that Amber Vinson, the other nurse infected with Ebola in Dallas, was “making good progress” and that “tests no longer detect virus in her blood.” However, Ms. Vinson was still being hospitalized at Emory for “supportive care,” a spokesman said, with no date scheduled for her discharge. Ms. Pham’s visit to the White House was arranged after administration officials learned of her pending release. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters that aides never questioned whether Mr. Obama should get close to Ms. Pham. “The only question that people had was whether or not she would be up for making the trip down here to the White House,” Mr. Earnest said.
us,The White House allowed only still photographers to witness the event. “Let’s give a hug for the cameras,” the president said.
world/middleeast,Security Council Debate Offers Preview of Palestinian Bid - The New York Times UNITED NATIONS — A preview of the expected showdown over whether to admit a Palestinian state as a full member of the United Nations when world leaders gather here in September played out in the Security Council on Tuesday. Supporters evoked the Arab Spring, in which millions of people across the Middle East sought freedom from oppression, as a fitting backdrop for an endorsement of the Palestinian people’s release from 44 years of Israeli occupation. Opponents, essentially Israel and the United States, condemned the idea as an ineffective “shortcut” that would not budge the deadlocked peace negotiations. The Palestinians have yet to determine whether to seek full membership — such an act faces a threatened American veto in the Security Council — or to petition the General Assembly for enhanced observer status. That would give them the aura of international recognition as a state — a status held only by the Holy See — but would fall short of full membership. (They currently hold observer status akin to that of an organization.) “The road to admission could be the expressway or could be the local road,” the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, told reporters on Tuesday. “Either way we are moving in that direction because the ultimate objective will be admission.”
world/middleeast,The Security Council holds a monthly discussion on the Arab-Israeli dispute that typically drones on much like the conflict itself, with each side repeating its own positions and grievances and absolutely no movement, so Tuesday’s discussion of Palestinian membership brought a frisson of novelty into the full day of speeches. The basic Israeli position, backed by Washington, is that the two sides have to negotiate the main six outstanding issues including borders, the status of Jerusalem and the return of refugees. “Now is the time for the international community to tell the Palestinian leadership what it refuses to tell its own people: there are no shortcuts to statehood,” said Ron Prosor, Israel’s permanent representative to the United Nations. The Palestinians, arguing that ongoing settlement activity by Israel is gradually erasing the prospects for a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, say that membership would solidify the effort toward such a resolution. Mr. Mansour, speaking to reporters, suggested that the Palestinians might try to overcome an American veto by getting hundreds of thousands of ordinary Palestinians to demonstrate in cities and villages in the coming weeks to demand an end to occupation—mirroring demonstrations for basic rights across the Arab world. Many supporters of Palestinian membership likened the two movements. “If we are to win the hearts and minds of the Arab people and support them in meeting their aspirations,” said Fazli Corman, Turkey’s deputy permanent representative, “we must be able to show them our collective determination toward reaching a just and viable peace in the region.”
world/middleeast,European nations appear divided on the issue, with a collective position deemed impossible given that 9 of its 27 members already recognize Palestine as a nation. In the Security Council, Germany seems opposed to membership with France and Britain sounding supportive if noncommittal. Arab states, while supporting the Palestinian effort, are leaning toward the General Assembly option as a way of avoiding a confrontation with Washington. The United States is in something of an awkward position because President Obama, in his speech to the General Assembly last September, said that he hoped peace negotiations would result in Palestine joining the United Nations this September. But his attempts to even get the negotiations started have failed Like other Western envoys, the deputy permanent American representative, Rosemary A. DiCarlo, used her speech Tuesday to encourage Syrians who protest peacefully to demand “their universal rights.” But she threatened to veto any Palestinian attempt to undertake “unilateral campaigns at the United Nations.” Many states praised the two-year Palestinian effort to create institutions needed to run a state, including a security apparatus, although the United States and Israel said those institutions continued to fall short. Given that effort, though, Robert H. Serry, the United Nations envoy for the peace process, said time was running out for the political developments that are necessary to show that such achievements bear fruit. “I cannot but describe the situation where Palestinian state building has matured on the West Bank, but the political track has failed to converge, as dramatic,” he said.
business,Sliver of Medicare Doctors Get Big Share of Payouts - The New York Times A tiny fraction of the 880,000 doctors and other health care providers who take Medicare accounted for nearly a quarter of the roughly $77 billion paid out to them under the federal program, receiving millions of dollars each in some cases in a single year, according to the most detailed data ever released in Medicare’s nearly 50-year history. In 2012, 100 doctors received a total of $610 million, ranging from a Florida ophthalmologist who was paid $21 million by Medicare to dozens of doctors, eye and cancer specialists chief among them, who received more than $4 million each that year. While more money by far is spent for routine office visits than any other single expenditure, one of the most heavily reimbursed procedures — costing a total of $1 billion for 143,000 patients — is for a single treatment for an eye disorder common in the elderly. The Medicare data — all for 2012 and the subject of an intense legal battle — provides an unprecedented look at the practice of medicine across the country, shedding fresh light on the treatment decisions physicians and other practitioners make every day. It will also provide consumers with an ability to compare doctors and treatments in a way they have never had until now.
business,Fraud investigators, health insurance plans, researchers and others will spend weeks poring over the information about how many tests were ordered and procedures performed for every provider who received Medicare payments under Part B, which excludes payments to hospitals and other institutions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is making the data publicly available on Wednesday. While total Medicare spending — including hospitals, doctors and drugs — is approaching $600 billion a year, payments to individual doctors have long been shrouded in secrecy. For decades, the American Medical Association, the powerful doctors’ group, and others have blocked the release of the information, citing privacy concerns and the potential for misuse of the information. But a federal judge ruled last year that the information could be made public. Medicare paid $12 billion for 214 million office and outpatient visits, most of them described as between 15 and 25 minutes long. The practitioners — usually doctors, but sometimes nurse practitioners, were paid an average of $57 a visit. Much of Medicare spending is concentrated among a small fraction of doctors. About 2 percent of doctors account for about $15 billion in Medicare payments, roughly a quarter of the total, according an analysis of the data by The New York Times. These figures exclude commercial entities like clinical laboratories and ambulance services, which account for $13.5 billion of the $77 billion total. Only a quarter of the doctors are responsible for three-quarters of the spending. Medicare provided The New York Times with an advance look at the information but requested that individual doctors not be contacted until the data was made public. A database, searchable by doctors’ names, is available at nytimes.com.
business,“This is actually the most useful data set that Medicare has ever released,” said Dr. Bob Kocher, who served in the Obama administration and is now a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm. People will be able to see just how many elbow surgeries a given orthopedic surgeon has performed on Medicare patients, he said, and they will be able to better judge a doctor’s style of practice, for example, whether a CT scan is performed on every patient or only rarely. “You’re going to see variation,” he said. The American Medical Association, which chose not to try to block the release of the information, questioned the usefulness of these payments to assess doctors. “We know there are going to be limitations,” said Dr. Ardis Dee Hoven, the president of the association. “It’s raw claims data. This gives us no window into quality or anything of that nature.” While patients may know who performs a high number of procedures, like hip replacements, for example, they will not be able to tell anything about whether the patients needed the surgery or whether they benefited from the surgery. What’s more, Dr. Hoven cautioned, doctors were not able to review the data, and some of the information being made public could be wrong.
business,But the release of the information is likely to increase attention to particularly controversial areas of spending. About 3,300 ophthalmologists, for example, were paid a total of $3.3 billion from Medicare, according to the Times analysis. Much of the spending was the result of an expensive and frequent treatment for a kind of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly, and the cost of the drug is factored into the payments doctors receive. Ranibizumab, known by the brand name Lucentis, is injected into the eye as often as once a month. A cancer drug that is used as an alternative can cost much less. Other specialists also account for large portions of Medicare spending. Fewer than 1,000 radiation oncologists, for example, received payments totaling $1.1 billion. Regulators and others are also likely to seize on some of this information to find those doctors who perform an unusually high volume of services, raising the question of whether every test or procedure, like the placement of a cardiac stent, was medically necessary. “There’s a lot of potential for whistle-blowers and justified worry for fraudsters,” said Steven F. Grover, a lawyer who represents whistle-blowers who sue doctors and hospitals who they claim have committed fraud against the Medicare program. “There’s going to be a lot of litigation over this,” he said.
business,The Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, which serves as a federal watchdog on fraud and abuse for the agency, released a report in December recommending greater scrutiny of those physicians who were Medicare’s highest billers. The report recommended that Medicare establish a threshold to look more closely at the high billers. Regulators have also said they are scrutinizing the use of high-paying codes in places including the emergency room. Health insurance companies, which must now rely on only the claims they handle to look at doctors, are also likely to find the information valuable, according to Paul B. Ginsburg, a health economist and professor at the University of Southern California. Marrying the Medicare information to their own information, “all of a sudden they have a lot more to work with,” he said, in trying to better determine how an individual doctor treats patients — ordering lots of tests, for example, or being slow to operate. “This is going to be a very important change,” he said. Experts say the data must be used with caution. An individual doctor, for example, may seem to have a high volume of services because that doctor oversees medical residents or physician assistants but bills for those services. Medicare patients may be only a fraction of the patients a doctor sees. Despite its limitations, however, policy experts largely praised the release of the information, arguing that this was an important step to understanding how doctors practice medicine in this country.
business,“Any time Medicare releases a lot of data, it changes the conversation in America about transparency, about cost and quality,” said François de Brantes, the executive director of the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute. “It’s more a signal from Medicare to market,” he said.
technology,Q & A; Arming a Computer Against Trojan Horses - The New York Times Q. What are Trojan horses and how can I keep from getting them on my computer? Is there any software that scans for Trojan horses and removes them? A. A Trojan horse, which you might have seen mentioned in articles about computer security, is a potentially dangerous piece of software disguised as an innocent application, file or other bit of software downloaded from a Web site, or as an e-mail attachment. The name is taken from the story of the siege of Troy, when the Trojans were fooled into hauling inside their city walls a large wooden horse containing enemy Greek soldiers. Once inside, of course, the legendary Trojan horse caused a great deal of trouble. Once an electronic Trojan horse is in place on your computer, it can do things like giving hackers access to your machine or dumping viruses all over your hard drive. (A Trojan horse is different from a computer virus in that a Trojan horse doesn't replicate by itself.) A good antivirus program installed on your computer can help stop malicious code like Trojan horses from running loose around your personal data, but you should also be wary of file attachments and downloaded files from people or sites you don't know.
technology,To check for information on the latest Trojans, viruses and other bits of evil code, you can go to the page for the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute's CERT Coordination Center (www.cert.org). It also has an excellent Tech Tips link that offers several Frequently Asked Questions pages about e-mail viruses and a section on how the F.B.I. deals with computer crime. Also try the AntiViral ToolKit Pro Virus Encyclopedia page (www .avpve.com) and the home page of ICSA.net (www.icsa.net), an Internet security firm, for news about Trojan horses and other computer security threats. Q. Is there a way I can arrange a somewhat top-heavy list of Internet Explorer 5.0 bookmarks into a system of folders? A. Creating folders to help organize your Favorites by categories or other criteria can help you keep track of them, and it is a fairly easy thing to do in Internet Explorer 5.0 for Windows, as well as in the Macintosh edition. Creating folders in your Favorites list allows you to make submenus, which can shorten the overall length of the list and help you find certain links more quickly. One way to start is by going to the Favorites menu on the menu bar of the Explorer browser and selecting Organize Favorites from the list. You can also type Control-I to call  the Favorites pane into the browser window and click on Organize.
technology,The Organize Favorites option will call up a dialogue box that will let you create and name new folders that will show up on your Favorites list. For example, you can create a new folder named Sports and then move each sports-themed link into that folder with the Move to Folder button. You can also drag and drop your Favorites into folders in the Favorites pane in the browser window. Mac users of Internet Explorer 5.0 can make new folders from the New Folder option on the Favorites menu in the menu bar, or by clicking on the Favorites tab to slide out the list next to the browser window. In the area next to the broswer window, Favorites can be dragged and dropped into new folders or to new positions on the list. Those who use Version 4.0 or later of Netscape Navigator for the Macintosh can create new folders to organize their bookmarks by selecting Edit Bookmarks from the Bookmarks menu and then selecting New Folder from the File menu. Windows users who prefer Netscape's browser can get to similar Bookmark organizing tools in the Edit Bookmarks option under the Communicator menu in the menu bar.   J. D.

sports/football,The N.F.L. Goes Deep With Mobile and Verizon - The New York Times With television audiences for the N.F.L. getting smaller, the league’s new digital rights deal with Verizon Communications represents the latest challenge to the traditional media partnerships that for decades have served as the lifeblood for North America’s richest sports league. The league and Verizon announced Monday an extension to their mobile streaming agreement through 2022 that will give fans a series of options besides traditional television for watching their local teams, as well as games on Sunday, Monday and Thursday nights, even the playoffs and Super Bowl. The deal, which will cost Verizon more than $2 billion during the next five years, gives the telecommunications giant the rights to stream games across its variety of digital media brands, including Yahoo Sports, Complex and go90. In addition, fans no longer have to be Verizon customers to gain access to the games, which they can watch regardless of which company is their mobile provider. CBS, NBC, ESPN and Fox currently pay the NFL some $5 billion a year for the rights to televise those games. Those rights help those networks garner top fees from pay television distributors and help those distributors convince subscribers not to cut off their cable subscriptions. Rick Cordella, executive vice president and general manager for digital media at NBC Sports, a unit of the pay television distributor Comcast, said the Verizon deal could help expand the reach for NBC’s advertisers, since fans watching the Verizon stream will see NBC’s inventory of ads.
sports/football,“We are selling one audience, no matter where they watch our content,” Cordella said. Like previous agreements with Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo, the new Verizon agreement illustrates the N.F.L.’s proclivity to push the envelope to broaden its reach, especially among younger viewers, who may not have a pay television subscription, even if it means potentially angering its television partners as they approach the start of negotiations for new deals. In a statement announcing the deal, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was thrilled to get more deeply involved with digital distribution. “Live N.F.L. action directly on your mobile device — regardless of carrier — will give millions of fans additional ways to follow their favorite sport,” Goodell said. Hans Schroeder, an N.F.L. executive in charge of media, believes fans won’t choose to watch on their phones instead of their televisions, but instead will add to the television audience. “We think this is a very complementary way of growing, engaging and reaching younger fans that will ultimately become longer term viewers,” he said. Since 2010, Verizon mobile customers have been able to stream N.F.L. games for free through the N.F.L. Mobile app. The deal potentially allows Verizon, and the N.F.L., to reach more people, but also does away with what made the previous agreements so lucrative for Verizon: Exclusivity. When signing an extension of the mobile agreement in 2013, Verizon executives said that the number of subscribers the N.F.L. Mobile app helped retain, or add, contributed to the company’s decision to re-sign.
sports/football,Now Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile customers will also be allowed to stream N.F.L. games, as long as they go to Verizon-owned apps or websites with their mobile phones. Over the past few years, Verizon has acquired a spate of digital media companies, including paying more than $9 billion combined to buy AOL and Yahoo, a sign of the company’s growing ambitions at becoming a digital media powerhouse able to challenge the likes of Google and Facebook for advertising dollars. There are some protections for traditional broadcast partners built into the agreement, which does not extend to streaming on tablets or through smart televisions. For the N.F.L., the deal is surely a short-term win. Verizon is paying nearly double the amount of money each year and doesn’t retain exclusivity over the games, though they are adding a number of sponsorship benefits. But long term it seems certain to allow for further erosion of pay television subscriptions, and it will challenge the N.F.L.’s partners in legacy media, who are already facing two straight years of declining ratings. The N.F.L.’s broadcast agreements all expire after the 2022 season. With ratings trending downward and digital rights giants, such as Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google, so far balking at paying hundreds of millions, or billions, for sports rights, the N.F.L. could soon be in for a round of tense negotiations.
learning/lesson-plans,Reader Idea | Finding Artistic Inspiration in The New York Times’s Opinion Section - The New York Times Browse all our Reader Ideas. Reader Idea Week on The Learning Network continues. We’re publishing the work of educators across subjects, up and down levels, and around the world as teachers tell us about how they teach with The New York Times. Would you like to contribute an idea? Post about it here. In this edition, a teacher at the Rhode Island School of Design tells us how the “Op-Art” in The New York Times’s Opinion section inspired her student-artists to create their own pieces, shown here, that react to specific articles. ________ Idea: Students use the linoleum block printmaking technique to create an editorial illustration for the Opinion article of their choice. Teacher: Clara Lieu. Institution: Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, R.I. Grade Level: Twelfth grade students enrolled in Project Open Door, a college access program for teenagers. Why We Chose It: We’re inspired by the art in the Opinion section ourselves, using it frequently for our Picture Prompts, and for a lesson plan on what “Op-Art” does and how. But this takes those ideas much further. Here, students find Opinion articles on topics they are passionate about, and then create artwork that visually represents the premise of those articles. ________ What Professor Lieu Did and Why, in Her Own Words
learning/lesson-plans,When teaching studio art at the high school level, it’s always challenging to get my students to engage with the subject matter represented in their artwork. Many students focus almost entirely on honing their drawing technique, to the point that they don’t take the initiative to create a purpose for their images to exist or communicate with the viewer. Consequently, it’s common at the high school level for student artworks to be visually beautiful and technically accomplished, but for the subject or meaning behind the piece to be barely touched upon. This linoleum block printmaking project is one way that gets my students to think deeply about how to communicate an idea in a visual manner. I ask my students to begin by exploring the Opinion section of The New York Times. Students first skim the headlines to find subject matter in which they have a personal interest. I’ve discovered that students can find an Opinion article that relates to a subject they are passionate about. The articles in the Opinion section are extremely diverse. Within one day, my students found articles about Barack Obama’s legacy, school lunch issues, the water crisis in Flint, Mich., and much more. These topics stimulated thoughtful conversations about everything from politics to culture to health in our classroom. Speaking to the students about the article they chose, I could hear the excitement in their voices. When students are personally invested in their subject matter, the artwork they create is always more compelling.
learning/lesson-plans,Next, we discussed the field of editorial illustration, and talked about visual strategies professional illustrators use to communicate the core ideas expressed in each article. We analyzed many editorial illustrations that accompanied articles in the Opinion section, and deconstructed how those illustrations were able to visually represent the premise of the article. Students then created thumbnail sketches to plan out their images, and to make sure that their ideas were clearly communicated. Students drew six contrasting sketches for their article, making changes and adjustments until they had a piece that effectively conveyed the themes in their article. Many of the editorial illustrations in The Times are bold, graphic and have an immediate visual impact on the reader. The inherent visual characteristics of linoleum block printmaking are an excellent match to create editorial illustrations of this nature. The process of creating a linoleum block print demands tremendous patience, time and concentration. My students spent many hours carefully carving their linoleum blocks using sharp linoleum cutters. Moving on to the inking and printing stage is always so much fun for students. There’s an enormous range of artistic experimentation you get to experience through the endless combinations of ink colors and paper. Printmaking makes this experimentation process easy and convenient, since the print can be produced as many times as you desire. We used printing techniques such as mixing color variations in the printmaking ink, doing rainbow rolls and trying out different colored papers.
learning/lesson-plans,Finally, the project concludes with the “elimination print” technique, a process in which one can achieve several colors in one image by using only a single block. Because of the complexity of the process, verbally explaining this technique to my students almost always proves to be fruitless. I usually have to get one very confused student to push through the technique so that the entire class can witness it in action as a concrete example. This is one of those techniques that is almost impossible to understand until you actually do it yourself. The lessons in this project occur on multiple levels. Students can find their personal passions and interests in The Times’s Opinion section. They gain exposure to the field of editorial illustration, experience the complex but rewarding technique of linoleum block printmaking, and finally, produce an artwork that has meaning and depth.

us/politics,Trump Repeats False Claim About Canada After Admitting Uncertainty Over Figure - The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump repeated on Thursday his false assertion that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada, the morning after privately telling Republican donors that he had deliberately insisted on that claim in a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada without knowing whether it was true. Mr. Trump’s private admission to having a loose grasp of the facts and his public refusal to back down from the incorrect statement — the United States has an overall surplus in trade with Canada — were vivid illustrations of the president’s cavalier attitude about the truth, and a reminder of how that approach has taken hold at the White House. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had chosen his figures selectively in the conversation with Mr. Trudeau and in a subsequent Twitter post that repeated the claim. The president was referring only to the trade of goods, Ms. Sanders said, which ignores the larger trade surplus in services the United States exports to Canada. And in a briefing with reporters, she acknowledged that Mr. Trump had fabricated an anecdote he told the donors about unfair trading practices — Japanese officials, he claimed, conduct a test on American cars by dropping a bowling ball on their hoods from 20 feet high, and those that dent are barred from being imported.
us/politics,“Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” Ms. Sanders told reporters who confronted her about the veracity of the tale. “But it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.” Her explanation came two weeks after Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that she sometimes told white lies on behalf of Mr. Trump. The latest instance of Mr. Trump bending the truth emerged after The Washington Post published an account of the president boasting about his disingenuous exchange with Mr. Trudeau at a fund-raising dinner on Wednesday night in Missouri. On Thursday, the president refused to back down from the erroneous claim about the trade balance between the United States and Canada. “We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive),” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. In an audio recording from the dinner obtained by The Post, a transcript of which was published on Thursday, Mr. Trump recounted how he pressed that point in a meeting with Mr. Trudeau even though he had “no idea” whether it was true. “P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do,” Mr. Trump added in his tweet.
us/politics,The United States ran a trade surplus of $600 million in goods and services with Canada in January, according to the Commerce Department, a metric that reflects the difference between what the United States exports to Canada and what it imports from that country. In 2016, the United States had a trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion, according to a fact sheet posted on the website of the United States trade representative. But during the fund-raiser for a Senate candidate in Missouri, Mr. Trump said he had refused to concede the point in a meeting with Mr. Trudeau, as the prime minister repeatedly pushed back. “He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none; Donald, please,’” Mr. Trump told the donors according to the transcript, calling Mr. Trudeau a “nice guy, good-looking.” “I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know,” Mr. Trump said. “I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid.” Mr. Trump’s retelling drew rebukes from some diplomats and lawmakers who argued that it reflected a dangerous penchant by the commander in chief to misrepresent the truth. “The president’s admission that he’s literally making things up while speaking face-to-face with a world leader should stop us all in our tracks,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “How can any other government — ally or adversary — have any confidence in what our president says when he admits to lying?”
us/politics,The account was particularly extraordinary given that it reflected Mr. Trump’s willingness to dissemble even with a close ally of the United States, albeit one that he has taken on aggressively in recent months as he presses to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and secure terms that are more advantageous to the United States. During the conversation, the president said he and Mr. Trudeau had tangled repeatedly about the trade balance, with the prime minister saying, “Nope, we have no trade deficit,” and Mr. Trump ultimately sending an aide to, “Check, because I can’t believe it.” The president then claimed that his contention had been validated, appearing to quote an aide he said had told him, “‘Well sir you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. But when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.” Ms. Sanders repeated that rationale during her briefing on Thursday, saying that Mr. Trump had been “accurate” in his assertion to Mr. Trudeau. In a tweet, she later said both she and the president had been referring to the more than $17 billion trade deficit in goods last year between the United States and Canada. Census Bureau data shows that, when trade in services was counted, the surplus was $2.8 billion. While Mr. Trump has focused almost exclusively on trade in manufactured goods, his advisers note that omitting trade in services produces a skewed picture of the United States’ standing.
us/politics,“Focusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States’ comparative advantage in services,” the president’s Council of Economic Advisers wrote last month in a report. Trade with the United States is a critical part of Canada’s export-dependent economy. But the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the economic relationship between the two countries have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger in Canada. Marc Garneau, who is the chairman of the Canada-U.S. relations committee in Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet, rejected on Thursday the president’s deficit claim. “At this point, it’s very important to point out that there is over $2 billion a day of trade between our two countries and over all annually the United States has a small surplus with Canada,” Mr. Garneau told reporters in Montreal. The president’s reported remarks dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some. “If it came from any other world leader, it would be troubling,” said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. “But pretty obviously, he’s not a details guy and he’s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.” In Quebec, where Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade tactics, protectionist impulses and “America First” mantra have been met with concern and bemusement, Canadians said they were unimpressed by what some construed as just the latest example of obfuscation by Mr. Trump.
us/politics,“It is scary, as his lying has become the new normal,” said Cory Whiteduck, 35, a radio host and cigarette seller in Kitigan Zibi reserve, near Maniwaki, Quebec, about 85 miles north of Ottawa. “Normally, it would raise red flags, and a politician would be in trouble. It is not a productive way of doing things or a good mentality.” The account of the president’s slapdash approach to statistics comes after a dispute between Canada and the United States over potentially crippling duties on steel and aluminum that the president introduced last week. The sanctions were temporarily suspended in Canada’s case, pending renegotiation of Nafta. Officials in Mr. Trump’s administration insisted that the United States runs a steel trade deficit with Canada even though data from both governments show that trade is balanced. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiators have presented a list of demands for revising Nafta that Canada has declared unacceptable. Mr. Trudeau has said that Canada is prepared to abandon Nafta rather than accept a “bad deal” and Mr. Trump has similarly threatened to withdraw from the pact. Bruce A. Heyman, the United States ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama, said that Mr. Trump’s approach was “creating a crisis where none existed before.” “Lying to your friends only hurts the relationship,” Mr. Heyman wrote on Twitter. “Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you just casually damage this realtionship?”
sports/golf,Time Is No Ally to Jordan Spieth in His Career Grand Slam Bid - The New York Times CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Pressure? What pressure? At first, Jordan Spieth took the long view when asked about completing the career grand slam at this week’s P.G.A. Championship, a prospect made possible by his victory last month at the British Open. “If I’m healthy and playing well, I play in 30 of them, I believe I’ll have plenty of chances to win them, but it doesn’t have to be this year,” Spieth said before trying to win his third tournament in a row last week at the Bridgestone Invitational. By the end of the week, Spieth had revised his thinking. As he put the final strokes on a tie for 13th, his first finish outside the top 10 since the United States Open in June, Spieth found his mind wandering. “I was thinking about it a little today on the course,” he said Sunday in Akron, Ohio. “You know, if you don’t win next week, next year obviously you focus on the majors, but the P.G.A. does become kind of that one that’s starred and that’s so long away, 365 days away.” Spieth, 24, is wise to sense the urgency, even if he says he is not obsessed with becoming the youngest man to win all four majors or the sixth over all to complete the feat — ahead of Rory McIlroy, who is missing only the Masters green jacket, and Phil Mickelson, who is short a United States Open title.
sports/golf,At Spieth’s age, it would be easy to view the future as a highway that he can drive on cruise control all night long. But the road is never smooth. There will be blind curves and detours, flat tires and overheated engines, starless nights and sunless days. The proof is all around him. Look at Jimmy Walker, who became a first-time major winner at last year’s P.G.A. Championship and then helped the United States to the Ryder Cup. He anticipated a luminous 2017, but a Lyme disease diagnosis in April sidelined him for over a month. It continues to sap his strength. Walker has one top-10 finish in 19 official tour events, and he can’t be sure how he’ll feel from one round to the next. “This is just life, and bad things happen sometimes,” Walker said. “I’m just glad that I’m feeling better,” he added, “but there’s still a lot of stuff that is lingering.” Spieth is on the kind of roll that Walker imagined for himself when he held aloft the Wanamaker Trophy last summer. In 18 starts this season, Spieth has eight top-10 finishes, including three victories. With momentum comes a kind of amnesia. Even the best are served reminders that they are mortals, not magicians. For Ernie Els, that moment came on the Sunday of the 1995 P.G.A. Championship. Els, then 25 and already a United States Open winner, shot sub-70 scores at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles in each of the first three rounds to take a three-stroke lead into the final day. He closed with a two-over 72 to finish tied for third. In 74 subsequent rounds at the P.G.A. Championship, Els has never again held the lead.
sports/golf,He won a second U.S. Open in 1997, three years after his first, and added the 2002 and 2012 British Open titles. Els’s four major titles propelled him into the World Golf Hall of Fame. But Els expected to be farther along Glory Road by now. “In ’95, I had a three-shot lead going to the P.G.A., couldn’t get it done and in ’96 missed out on another very narrow loss,” Els said, referring to his tie for second at the British Open, two strokes behind Tom Lehman. “And I kind of stalled.” Around the same time, a youngster named Tiger Woods materialized like a boulder in his path. “When Tiger came in ’97, and him winning the Masters in the way he did,” Els said, referring to Woods’s 12-stroke victory for the first of his 14 major titles, “that kind of threw me off a little bit. I thought I was really one of the top players, which I was, but that was a pretty special display of golf.” Els finished second to Woods at the United States and British Opens in 2000. He also recorded a couple of thirds in majors that Woods won. “I could have had a couple more, definitely, with him around,” Els said with a rueful smile. On the road that Spieth is speeding along now, who is to say that he won’t be passed at some point by Hideki Matsuyama of Japan? Or by some teenager from China who pops up on the horizon?
sports/golf,Of course, Spieth should savor what he has already accomplished. “It was only two weeks ago that I was able to get the third leg, and that’s so fresh in my mind,” he said Wednesday, referring to the British Open. “I’m so happy about that that I can’t add pressure to this week. I’m free-rolling, and it feels good.” With a victory, Spieth can surpass Woods as the youngest to win all four majors. And he’d do it in a fashion that befits his fastidiousness on the course — chronologically in the order in which they are played during the year, starting with the Masters and then the U.S. Open in 2015. “Do I have to be the youngest?” he said. “No, I don’t feel that kind of pressure. Would it be really cool? Absolutely.” Spieth added: “I’m here, so I’m going to go ahead and try. But I believe I’m going to have plenty of chances, and I’m young enough to believe in my abilities that it will happen at some point.” But he knows not to take his foot off the gas or his eyes off the Wanamaker Trophy. The road that looks so seductive now can rise up to defeat him. “If I don’t win one in the next 10 years,” Spieth said, referring to the P.G.A. Championship, “then maybe there’s added pressure then. Hopefully we don’t have to have this conversation in 10 years.”
nyregion,Timeline of Weiner Case - The New York Times FRIDAY, MAY 27: A sexually suggestive photograph is sent to a young woman from the Twitter account of Representative Anthony D. Weiner. It is quickly deleted. SATURDAY, MAY 28: A Twitter user who has discovered the photograph shares it with his followers and alerts the conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart. Mr. Weiner says on Twitter that his Facebook account has been hacked. Mr. Breitbart’s Web site, BigGovernment.com, publishes the photograph. SUNDAY, MAY 29: A spokesman for Mr. Weiner says, “Anthony’s accounts were obviously hacked.” MONDAY, MAY 30: A spokesman says Mr. Weiner has asked a lawyer to look into the matter and determine if civil or criminal actions against a hacker should be taken. Mr. Weiner tells CNN: “I was hacked. It happens to people; you move on.” TUESDAY, MAY 31: Mr. Weiner has a testy exchange with reporters, declining to answer questions about the Twitter photograph and saying it is time to focus on more important issues. He refers to one reporter with a derogatory term. “If I were giving a speech to 45,000 people and someone in the back of the room threw a pie or yelled out an insult,” he says, “I would not spend the next two hours of my speech responding to that pie or that insult.”
nyregion,WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1: Mr. Weiner gives interviews about the photo message to several news media outlets. He denies sending the photograph but tells MSNBC that he cannot “say with certitude” that it is not of him. He tells ABC News, “I was the victim of this,” and bristles when asked if it was appropriate for him to follow young women on Twitter, saying, “The implication is outrageous.” THURSDAY, JUNE 2: Mr. Weiner again says he is finished answering questions about the issue. SUNDAY, JUNE 5: For the first time in years, Mr. Weiner cancels his appearance at the Salute to Israel Parade. MONDAY, JUNE 6: BigGovernment.com posts additional photographs and e-mails that it says were sent by Mr. Weiner to an unidentified woman. At a news conference, Mr. Weiner acknowledges that he sent the original photograph and that it is a picture of him. He also says he sent other inappropriate and explicit photos and messages to women he met over the Internet. “I came here to accept the full responsibility for what I’ve done,” he says. “I am deeply regretting what I have done, and I am not resigning.”
us,Judge in Stanford Sexual Assault Trial Will No Longer Hear Criminal Cases - The New York Times A California judge who came under fire and was the subject of a recall campaign for his sentencing decisions in a Stanford University sexual assault case will be transferred after he asked to be removed from hearing criminal cases. The judge, Aaron Persky, of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, will be moved to the civil division in San Jose, Calif., effective Sept. 6, according to an announcement late Thursday. “While I firmly believe in Judge Persky’s ability to serve in his current assignment, he has requested to be assigned to the civil division, in which he previously served,” the Santa Clara County Superior Court’s presiding judge, Rise Pichon, said in the announcement, which was obtained from the court on Friday. “Judge Persky believes the change will aid the public and the court by reducing the distractions that threaten to interfere with his ability to effectively discharge the duties of his current criminal assignment.” In the sexual assault trial in Palo Alto in June, Judge Persky sentenced Brock Turner, a former Stanford University champion swimmer, to six months in jail and three years’ probation for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a Dumpster after a party. The sentence, and the fact that Mr. Turner would in effect serve only three months, was denounced by victims’ advocates, who called for the judge’s removal from the bench. A petition online calling for impeachment hearings swelled to over 1.2 million signatures, members of Congress read excerpts from the victim’s statement publicly, and lawmakers introduced legislation to strengthen laws against sexual assault.
us,Mr. Turner, who was found guilty of three felony counts in March, is expected to be released on Sept. 2, a sheriff’s spokesman said. A rally calling for the judge’s removal will be held the same day in San Jose. The announcement of Judge Persky’s transfer came after he recused himself from what would have been another key court decision: He would have had to decide whether to reduce a felony conviction for possession of child pornography to a misdemeanor. Last Friday, Judge Persky said in court that while on vacation, he and his family became aware of publicity surrounding the new case, and that the attention had led to a “personal family situation” that might have raised doubts about whether he could be impartial, a court document said. No further details were provided. Joseph Macaluso, a spokesman for the Superior Court, said Friday that the judge’s recusal and his request for the transfer to civil cases were not related. Judge Pichon’s statement, first published in local news media including The San Jose Mercury News, noted that Judge Persky’s quick reassignment was made possible because another judge wanted to relocate to Palo Alto. Michele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor who is leading an effort to have voters decide next year whether Judge Persky should remain on the bench, said Friday that the recall effort would continue to publicize and compare his record with that of other judges.
us,“Many cases are heard in civil court involving women’s rights — for example, workplace and educational sexual harassment cases, or students suing their colleges for sexual assault, or victims suing their perpetrators,” Professor Dauber said. “All of those cases are civil cases, and there is no room for a biased judge in civil court either.” Roderick O’Connor, a deputy public defender in Santa Clara County and a supporter of Judge Persky’s, called the transfer a “big loss.” He said the judge didn’t deserve to be the target of “hysteria” because he is extremely prudent and fair, according to The Mercury News. “It’s a shame he’s moving,” he added, “because I believe criminal defendants and prosecutors deserve a judge of Persky’s caliber.”
books,You Are Not the Pine-Scented Air, O.K.? - The New York Times NINE HORSES Poems. By Billy Collins. 120 pp. New York: Random House. $21.95. THOUSANDS of Americans are walking around right now with Billy Collins poems in their heads. Or at least that's my guess. That the nation's current poet laureate is not only a wildly successful seller of books (as poets go, anyway) but also a charming public reader who can pack auditoriums is cause for cheer. But in the end, a poet's value should be measured by how tenaciously his poems hold listeners and readers after the microphone is turned off and the newly purchased book is closed. ''Do you know the Billy Collins poem about . . .'' is the beginning of a question I've heard a lot recently -- and not only from poets. Usually, the enthusiastic questioner can't call up Collins's exact phrasing. The poem remembered is the one about shoveling snow with Buddha, or the one about listening to jazz while musing on the three blind mice, or the one about undressing Emily Dickinson, or the one -- we forget what it's called -- about forgetting. If you often think of such poems but can't quote from them, that's partly because you don't go to Billy Collins for complex metrical effects or rhyme schemes, either of which might be usefully mnemonic. His pacing and sense of proportion are rhythmic and graceful, but their effect feels as tossed off and elusive as conversation. Nor can you often turn to Collins for much in the way of assonance, alliteration, wordplay, or even for a venturesome vocabulary. It's fair to say that you wouldn't want most poets to disregard so many tools of versification.
books,What, then, distinguishes Collins's poems from bite-size personal essays? His primary strength is that he is funny, at times hilarious; but so are some essayists. His originality derives, it seems, from the marriage of a loopy, occasionally surreal imagination (the moon looks like ''the top of Shakespeare's / famous forehead''; a dead groundhog in the road, like ''a small Roman citizen . . . still hailing Caesar'') to an ordinary life observed in just a few ordinary words. When he notices one day that ''everything seemed more life-size than usual,'' his plainness of delivery nearly sidesteps -- but not entirely -- how inexplicable, how poetic, are the feelings we all have about . . . things. And that's funny, but it's not merely funny. Collins's most delightful poems take their idiosyncratic flight from standard props: table, light, kitchen counter, car. He names Florence Nightingale and Mark Rothko when he needs to; he alludes obliquely to Yeats's ''Sailing to Byzantium''; he goes out on a limb to call a flower ''wild phlox perhaps'' -- but his lexicon and field of reference remain stubbornly generic. His beloved dog, which has wagged its way through several books, has not yet been named in his new one, ''Nine Horses.'' Not even promoted to ''my dog,'' it's still ''the dog.''
books,In ''Writing in the Afterlife,'' Collins makes explicit his no-clutter aesthetic: hell is a place where you'd have to describe ''not just the water'' but ''rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water, / not simply the shackles, but the rusty, / iron, ankle-shredding shackles.'' If the work of turning out such sonorous phrases is infernal, Collins's vacation from his own language is paradisiacal. One of the most antic poems in the book, ''By a Swimming Pool Outside Siracusa,'' shows the slightly tipsy poet, after a heady day of speaking Italian fairly well, speaking English not so well as before. The loss of fluency is happily enacted rather than explicated: this drink has extended permission to my mind to feel -- what's the word? - a friendship with the vast sky which is very -- give me a minute -- very blue. One appeal of the typical Collins poem is that it's less able to help you memorize it than to help you to remember, for a little while anyway, your own life. The persona in his poems, very much like us, is usually in too much of a hurry to pay proper attention and to express proper gratitude. Feelings of guilt for insufficient mindfulness follow this mildly hedonistic poet (he's a big one for coffee, cigarettes and lounging on the couch or the beach) wherever he goes.
books,He stops his car, in ''Roadside Flowers,'' to gaze at the wildflowers ''so as not to carry my non-stopping / around with me all day.'' Another poem with Collins at the wheel, ''No Time,'' shows him rushing past the graveyard where his parents are buried. He taps his horn to them: Then, all day long, I think of him rising up to give me that look of knowing disapproval while my mother calmly tells him to lie back down. It's a lovely moment, calling up the mornings of childhood when we could disturb our parents in their bedroom and be forgiven. There's no time, and no need, to say more; the poem ends here, after a compact eight lines. Among all the poems in ''Nine Horses,'' the marvelous ''Litany'' strikes me as the likeliest new candidate to inspire the question ''Do you know the Billy Collins poem about . . . ?'' What sets ''Litany'' apart is that the words themselves, not just the situation, are so memorable. That's because it capitalizes on some of the oldest verbal conventions in poetry -- parallelism, refrain, the lover's mystical hyperbole -- and simultaneously pokes fun at them. Quoting a snippet of a poem by the Belgian poet Jacques Crickillon (''You are the bread and the knife, / The crystal goblet and the wine''), Collins offers his lover a stanza of similarly lofty praises before asserting himself: However, you are not the wind in the orchard, the plums on the counter,
books,or the house of cards. And you are certainly not the pine-scented air. There is no way you are the pine-scented air. And the poet isn't finished: ''It might interest you to know . . . that I am the sound of rain on the roof.'' It turns out he's a lot of other things she may not have appreciated: ''I am also the moon in the trees / and the blind woman's teacup.'' He's not so hardhearted, though, that he won't throw her a bone at the end: ''But don't worry, I am not the bread and the knife. / You are still the bread and the knife.'' Comforted by that now familiar phrase as the poem closes, you also know you've had your mind freshened, robbed of a few complacencies. And that two-minute trajectory makes Billy Collins the pen and the ink, the keyboard and the screen . . . whatever you'd call the real thing in poetry.
us,Fate of Detroit’s Art Hangs in the Balance - The New York Times With a ruling by a federal judge on Tuesday that Detroit is eligible to enter bankruptcy, the fate of the city’s art collection — one of the finest in the country — now moves front and center in the legal battle over the city’s future. But the judge, Steven W. Rhodes, questioned for the first time the push by some of the city’s largest creditors to sell paintings and sculpture from the Detroit Institute of Arts, a sale that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars or more. While he did not say specifically that the art should be spared, Judge Rhodes, in a brief mention of the institute by name, said that such a sale would not have helped Detroit avoid bankruptcy. “A one-time infusion of cash by selling an asset,” he said, would have only delayed the city’s “inevitable financial failure” unless it could have also come up with a sustainable way to enhance income and reduce expenses. Judge Rhodes added that in considering selling assets, a city “must take extreme care that the asset is truly unnecessary in carrying out its mission.”
us,Some creditors argue that the art is not necessary for the city’s mission. Derek Donnelly, managing director of the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, a creditor, told The Detroit Free Press, “The D.I.A. or art is not an essential asset and especially not one that is essential to the delivery of services in the city.” A coalition of creditors filed a motion last week asking the judge to appoint a committee to oversee an independent appraisal of the collection, which is owned by the city and includes masterpieces by Bruegel, van Gogh and Cézanne. Financial Guaranty did not return telephone calls seeking comment on Judge Rhodes’s statement. Michael G. Bennett, an associate professor of law at Northeastern University School of Law, who was in the courtroom during the ruling, said, “Judge Rhodes seemed to be saying something that amounted to a defense of the collection.” A price tag on at least some of the pieces in the collection is expected soon. The city’s emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, hired the auction house Christie’s to appraise hundreds of selected pieces from the institute, and those estimated values are expected to be made public as part of the bankruptcy case by mid-December. In a talk with The Free Press’s editorial board after Tuesday’s ruling, Mr. Orr said that in “preliminary discussions” with Christie’s, it appeared that the market value of some of the best pieces in the collection would be less than $2 billion — a figure widely cited as a low estimate of the collection’s value — and that the appraisal could come in at less than $1 billion.
us,“We will try to get some value from the art in some fashion,” he told the board, but he said that did not mean that there was any plan at present to sell any art at auction. (Other possibilities for generating money from the art could include using it as collateral for loans or charging to lend pieces out, although the museum has had little success in doing that in the past.) Mr. Orr, in his presentation to the newspaper, added, referring to the art: “Let’s be clear. That’s a city asset.” Mr. Orr has said publicly that museum officials must “save themselves” by finding a way to contribute money, possibly as much as $500 million, toward the city’s debt relief. Mr. Bennett, who has argued publicly against the sale of art, added that the ruling seemed to say that “even if sales from the institute generated a lot of money — let’s say $900 million or even $1 billion — it’s still not going to solve the city’s problem in any fundamental way, and it could end up contributing to more problems down the road.” No other American museum the size of the institute has ever confronted such a threat to the integrity of its collection. Museum officials, who have said they will go to court to try to prevent any sale, have warned that if any pieces are sold the museum will no longer be able to attract donors and will immediately lose a crucial stream of tax revenue voted in last year by three Michigan counties.
us,Such a loss of operating revenue and donations, said the museum’s director, Graham W. J. Beal, would almost certainly lead to what he called a “nonprofit controlled liquidation” of the museum.
your-money,The Insurance Market Mystifies an Airbnb Host - The New York Times So let’s say you decided to place your home or a few rooms inside it among the million-plus listings that the rental site Airbnb now claims to have. And let’s also say that you’re the rule-abiding sort and find the part of the company’s website where it encourages you to check with your homeowners or renter’s insurance company to make sure you have proper liability coverage for guests. What would happen if you did so? If you’re Julie Pfeffer, who rents two rooms in her 200-year-old home in Hockessin, Del., and your insurer is State Farm, it would tell you that your policy was going to be canceled in 30 days. At which point, you would be in a real pickle. Airbnb now provides backup liability protection for people who put United States listings on its site. It kicks in when and if your own insurance company denies the claim, and many would, given that they don’t like covering commercial activity in people’s homes. This secondary coverage is all well and good, but most homeowners need (or at least want) primary coverage in the first place. Their mortgage company probably requires it, or they worry about placing too much faith in the free liability coverage provided by a start-up like Airbnb. And if insurers won’t sell any coverage to homeowners if they have a part-time home rental operation going on, it will be trouble for everyone involved.
your-money,Ms. Pfeffer eventually found a solution, but it wasn’t easy. And this is mostly the fault of the insurance industry, which doesn’t always want to answer questions about this sort of activity, whose agents aren’t always as knowledgeable as they should be and whose own policy language can be incredibly confusing. Airbnb’s site says that “some” homeowners and renters insurance policies protect its users from “certain” lawsuits that result from an injury and tells users to “confirm” that rentals are covered before putting up a listing. This is rather rosy language, given that plenty of insurance companies explicitly deny coverage for any kind of regular commercial activity in the home. Airbnb knows this, which is why it will begin offering the $1 million of secondary coverage next month. It’s called Host Protection Insurance, it’s free and it applies even when hosts are violating local ordinances by renting in the first place, violating the terms of their lease by renting or breaking a condo or homeowners insurance association rule by doing so But Airbnb didn’t have anything like that when Ms. Pfeffer started renting out rooms a few times each month, and she wanted primary coverage anyway. A retired equity analyst, she owns her home outright and does not answer to a condo board or homeowners association. An experienced traveler herself, she joined Airbnb because she enjoyed meeting new people and liked the idea of generating some income to cover the costs of living in a historic home. She doesn’t need the money, but she likes hosting. (Guests like her, too; she has five-star reviews across the board.)
your-money,For a quarter-century, Ms. Pfeffer had been a loyal State Farm customer, but when she talked to an agent about her rental activity, it quickly became clear that it could not offer her any kind of liability rider and no longer wanted her as a customer. The agent made some noises about installing fire escapes from every bedroom and buying a commercial policy that might have cost more than her annual rental income, but that was out of the question. State Farm confirms that this is standard operating procedure for Airbnb hosts like Ms. Pfeffer and others like them who come clean about their rental activities. “The property owner changed the way she used her home on a fairly regular basis. Renting rooms in a home brings exposures that an individual and insurer should mitigate,” said Rachael Risinger, a company spokeswoman, in an emailed statement. “Homeowners insurance is intended for owner-occupied properties and we do not anticipate regular renting of a home under our current policy.” I explained all of this to Airbnb and asked how often it heard about the hosts for its 150,000 United States listings losing their homeowners insurance or being threatened by insurers. “The situation you’ve described is extremely rare,” said Jakob Kerr, a company spokesman, in an emailed statement. “We built Host Protection Insurance to give our hosts more peace of mind, and it covers every host in the United States, in every city for every reservation.” The company also encourages hosts to tell policy makers and business leaders about what being a host adds to their lives, all in the interest of updating laws and insurance company rules.
your-money,State Farm is the largest provider of homeowners insurance in the United State, according to SNL Financial. So how could this be rare? One possible reason: Most likely, only a tiny number of Airbnb hosts are as responsible as Ms. Pfeffer and come clean with their insurance companies about their rental activity. Rather than be fired as a State Farm customer, Ms. Pfeffer quit. Then she had to shop for a new policy. One of the companies she considered working with was Chubb, which tends to cover more expensive properties. But the independent agent she spoke to said that the company would not cover her rental activity, either. That is not, however, what a Chubb executive said in a column I wrote about Airbnb’s new insurance coverage two weeks ago. There, the company promised full liability coverage for paying guests as long as the homeowner was not making more than $15,000 in rental revenue each year. This week, a Chubb spokesman stood by that figure, which suggests that the agent who spoke to Ms. Pfeffer (and who knows how many others representing many of the largest insurance companies) has no idea what the rules actually are. Ms. Pfeffer got better news at the Liberty Mutual office in Wilmington, Del. There, the agent said that she didn’t need any special rider or commercial coverage for her room rentals; the standard homeowners coverage was fine. Given what had gone on with State Farm, she was wary, so she got it in writing.
your-money,Then she read my column, however, and wondered if her agent had gotten it wrong. In that column, Liberty Mutual did not answer any of the questions I posed to it about its rules, but one state insurance commissioner stated quite plainly that homeowners policies generally do not cover business activities in the home. When Ms. Pfeffer and I first spoke, she did not want to go public. As she put it, she had at least one leg to stand on given that she had her coverage parameters in writing from the agent. Why go to Liberty Mutual with her concerns and run the risk of losing her insurance altogether if the agent was wrong? Liberty Mutual finally agreed to have an actual conversation with me about their policies but was understandably reluctant to comment on a customer who would not offer up her name. Back and forth we went, and eventually everyone came around. The agent, it turns out, was right all along. Liberty Mutual’s policy in Delaware allows for liability coverage for “occasional” use of a residence as a rental, which covers her few-times-a-month activity. This is true even though the previous paragraph in her policy makes it clear that there will be no liability coverage when the policyholder is “engaged” in a “business.” Any random homeowner could be forgiven for not knowing the precise definitions of engaged and occasional and business, particularly in this context. Maybe we could let the insurance agents off, too, though it’s a stretch given that I and others have been asking versions of these insurance questions for years.
your-money,The insurance companies, however, ought to do better. It is not too much to ask that for every policy in every state, they have a list that has been reviewed by a lawyer and contains frequently asked questions. That document should also define occasional, define business and define engaged. Even better, they could just do what Chubb does and set a reasonable cap on rental income or some other clear rule about when it no longer covers the activity. Insurance company actuaries eat data for breakfast. Airbnb has a lot of it at this point. They ought to share it with the insurers so they can figure out what level of coverage they want to offer and then explain it to the rest of us in plain English.
arts/design,Civilization on Display: Buddha’s Caves in Dunhuang - The New York Times DUNHUANG, China SAND is implacable here in far western China. It blows and shifts and eats away at everything, erasing boundaries, scouring graves, leaving farmers in despair. It’s one of many threats to the major tourist draw of this oasis city on the lip of the Gobi desert: the hundreds of rock-cut Buddhist grottoes that pepper a cliff face outside  town. Known as Mogaoku  — “peerless caves”  — and filled with paradisiacal frescos and hand-molded clay sculptures of savior-gods and saints, they are, in size and historical breadth, like nothing else in the Chinese Buddhist world. And Mogaoku is in trouble. Thrown open to visitors in recent decades, the site has been swamped by tourists in the past few years. The caves now suffer from high levels of carbon dioxide and humidity, which are severely undermining conservation efforts. The short-term solution has been to limit the number of caves that can be visited and to admit people only on timed tours, but the deterioration continues. Plans are under way to recast the entire Dunhuang experience in a way that will both intensify and distance it. Digital technology will give visitors a kind of total immersion encounter with the caves impossible before now, but that immersion will take place 15 miles from the site.
arts/design,The question of access versus preservation is a poignant one and is by no means confined to Mogaoku. It applies to many fragile monuments. What are we willing to give up to keep what we have?  If you’re a Buddhist  — I am not — you know that the material world is a phantom or a dream, “a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, a flickering lamp,” as the Buddha puts it in the Diamond Sutra. As part of that world Mogaoku is a phantom too, but one that I had always wanted to see, one of my must-get-to-in-this-lifetime places. And finally I was here. With the permission of the Dunhuang Academy, the Chinese conservation and research body that oversees the caves, I stayed in quarters at the site rather than in Dunhuang itself, a city that doesn’t look like much now but certainly must have once. Set between Mongolia and Tibet, it was a vital, cosmopolitan juncture on the Silk Road. Whether you traveled the northern branch east from Rome, or the southern one from Arabia, you ended up doing business here. And because of its gateway position, it was where Buddhism spilled out of India and Central Asia into China, leaving a residue of spectacular art. The first cave at Mogaoku was carved in A.D. 366 by an itinerant monk named Yuezun who said that one night he saw flamelike lights pulsing across the cliff face and took them as a sign: Here you must stay. So he cut a hole in the sandstone wall and moved in.
arts/design,The association of caves with religious devotion, ancient in India, caught on here. The earliest examples, small and plain, were used for shelter and meditation, occasionally for burials. From the window of my room in the academy’s guest house I could see dozens of these hollows set high up on the cliff, their low entrances black with shadows. They are hard to reach and, apart from archaeologists, few people visit them now. Probably few ever did. They were made for solitude. Yet by the early fifth century, a cave boom was underway in the Dunhuang area, with activity concentrated at Mogaoku.  Larger and larger grottoes were excavated as temples and monastic lecture halls: essentially, public spaces. Many had chapel-like niches and free-standing walk-around altars, all cut from stone. As with the Ajanta Buddhist caves in India, interiors were carved with architectural features  — beams, eaves, pitched roofs, coffered ceiling  — as if to simulate buildings. Painting covered everything. Murals illustrating jatakas, tales from the Buddha’s past lives, were popular; they’re like panoramic comic-book storyboards spread across a wall. For imperially commissioned interiors, images of princeling saints and court fetes were the rule. Rock ceilings were covered with fields of decorative patterning to evoke an illusion of fabric pavilions. Any leftover space was filled with figures of tiny deities — Mogaoku was known as the Thousand Buddha Caves — painted directly on the plastered walls or stuck on as sculptural plaques.
arts/design,Sculpture was where Dunhuang departed from the Indian model. In Indian caves figures were chiseled from the living rock. Everything was literally of a piece. Maybe because the sandstone at Mogaoku was too crumbly for fine work, the artists here used another method. They made figures from mud mixed with grass and molded over bundled branches and reeds. Exceptionally large figures, in need of a solid core to keep them from collapsing, were made in a different way. The body of the 75-foot-tall Buddha in the cave known as the Nine-Story Temple is carved from the rock face and plastered over. His feet are planted at the cliff base; he looks out through a window, cut near the  top. Of the 800 or so caves created here from the 5th to 14th centuries, nearly half had some form of decoration. What survives adds up to a developmental timeline of Buddhist art in China, an encyclopedic archive of styles and ideas, of dashes forward and retreats to the past. But of course much of it has not survived. By the 11th century Dunhuang’s fortunes were in decline. Sea trade had cut into Silk Road traffic. Regional wars left the town isolated. Monks, possibly panicked by rumors of an Islamic invasion, sealed up tens of thousands of manuscript scrolls in a small cave. The invasion didn’t happen, but the books, many of them already ancient, stayed hidden and forgotten, as Mogaoku itself was for centuries.
arts/design,Nature went to work. Sand from the dunes swept into the grottoes. Rock facades gave way, leaving interiors exposed. When people finally reappeared, the damage only increased. In the late 19th century a wandering Taoist priest named Wang Yuanlu settled down and started a ruinous program of “conservation,” discovering the bricked-up library cave with its precious scrolls in the process. He didn’t know it, but he had made of one of the most important archaeological finds of modern times. Other people soon knew. In 1907 the British explorer Aurel Stein arrived. For a pittance he bought around 5,000 silk and paper scrolls from Wang and sent them to England. Some were paintings and banners; the bulk were religious and secular books in Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Mongolian and other regional languages, evidence of the capacious ethnic melting pot that China has always been. Of all Stein’s books the prize was a ninth-century woodblock copy of the Diamond Sutra, or the “Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom of the Diamond that Cuts Through Illusion.” As if defying the scripture’s insistence on transience as the only reality, this marvelous scroll is the earliest known dated example of a printed book, six centuries older than the Gutenberg Bible. After Stein came the French linguist and Sinologist Paul Pelliot. In one marathon reading session he eyeballed the entire remaining contents of the library cave, sorted out the cream and packed it off to Paris. Then a Japanese expedition arrived to claim a share, followed by a Russian one. In the 1920s the swashbuckling American art historian Langdon Warner sliced 26 murals from Mogaoku cave walls and gave them to Harvard, along with a pilfered sculpture. (You can still see the ghost-outlines of figures where he lifted off the thin plaster sheets.)
arts/design,Whatever else can be said of them, these men fully understood the value of what they saw at Mogaoku. “There was nothing to do but gasp,” Warner wrote of his first glimpse of decorated caves. This is still a natural reaction. It was my reaction. Accompanied by a Dunhuang Academy researcher and guide, Liu Qin, I visited two dozen caves in a single day, and afterward couldn’t shake what I’d seen. First there is darkness, intensified because of the blazing desert sun. When your eyes adjust to the dusky light filtering in, you see that you’re being observed by other eyes, those of a larger-than-life fifth century Northern Wei Buddha. He has a large broad head, soft limbs and a moony smile. Dressed in a hot-weather Indian dhoti, he looks like a giant toddler lost in a world of his own. Further inside, the only illumination is Mr. Liu’s flashlight. Visions come and go. A small sculptured Buddha backed by a jade-green halo meditates in a niche. A standing divinity wreathed by a garland of maiden angels wears a flower-spattered robe of Persian brocade. Calligraphic figures, blue against white, tumble across the wall like swallows in a wind. Feathered, but with human faces, riding dragon-drawn chariots, they might be immortals from Chinese mythology, though in the flickering light it is hard to tell.
arts/design,Then they are gone, replaced by court musicians with banjos and flutes. Soon these are gone too. Then a drama in several scenes about bandits being blinded for their crimes and rejoicing as the Buddha restores their sight. Gone. A corps of heavenly dancers, a hundred Maya Plisetskayas in saris. The flashlight sweeps a ceiling thick with colored patterns; they seem to stream toward a central lotus medallion like filings to a magnet. The total effect is riotous, hallucinatory, of another realm. No wonder Warner took chunks of it home. China, engulfed in a long period of political disunity and chaos, couldn’t prevent the plundering. Finally in 1944 the Dunhuang Research Institute, formed by a band of young Chinese scholars, took control of the site. Now called the Dunhuang Academy, it is still here, stabilizing the caves structurally, conserving their sculptures and paintings and monitoring visitor access. Mogaoku is charmed ground. In late spring and early summer the air is fragrant, the sky a lambent blue, the desert oceanically serene. And there is the art and the soaked-in atmosphere of devotion. The place leaves strong and alluring memories in the memories of visitors; in its caretakers it inspires lifelong loyalty. The current director of the Dunhuang Academy, Fan Jinshi, arrived as a graduate student in 1963. At that time getting here was an ordeal; there were no planes, few trains. The academy’s headquarters had neither electricity nor running water. She married, but her husband worked elsewhere. Sometimes they didn’t see each other for months at a time, once for a full year. In 1998, after 35 years on the job, she was named director of the academy. At 70, she is still here, working as hard as ever.
arts/design,During her time much has changed. The site has been brought technologically up to date. A once-bare-bones staff has grown to around 300 full-time conservators, researchers, groundskeepers and guards, supplemented since the late 1980s by training teams from the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, led by Neville Agnew. The ever-encroaching tide of sand has been slowed by a system of wind-breaking nets. Transportation to Dunhuang has become relatively easy. A new train station has just gone up; the airport runway, once made of tar that was said to turn soft in the sun, has been reinforced. Yet from a plane window the town still has a marooned, precarious look, like a lone atoll at sea. In 1980 the caves, or some of them, were opened to the public, although only a trickle of visitors came, most of them Japanese tourists in search of the roots of their own Buddhist tradition. Recently this pattern has radically changed. With a flourishing economy, a relaxation of the Cultural Revolution’s disapproval of religion and the central government’s strenuous promotion of a new nationalist pride, hundreds of thousands of tourists, 90 percent of them Chinese, are coming to Mogaoku each year, jamming into the caves. The impact has been significant. The risk of direct contact with art is somewhat reduced by the installation of transparent screens, but the physical degradation caused by fluctuating atmospheric conditions — humid to dry to humid again — is acute. Although no one is saying so, it is possible that without major change, all the caves will eventually have to be closed to the public.
arts/design,Plans for drastic remedial action are in place. Under Dr. Fan and the vice director, Wang Xudong, the academy will build by 2011 a new visitor reception center several miles from the caves, near the airport and railroad station. All Mogaoku-bound travelers will be required to go to the center first, where they will be given an immersive introduction to the caves’ history, digital tours of interiors and simulated restorations on film of damaged images. They will then be shuttled to the site itself, where they will take in the ambience of its desert-edge locale and see the insides of one or two caves before returning to where they started. (About 70 percent of the money for the visitor center — the equivalent of $38 million — is coming from the Chinese government. The rest must be raised from private sources. Details related to the project can be found on friendsofdunhuang.org.) For Chinese visitors a partly virtual approach may not feel unusual. Many museums in China give equal time to art objects and information technology. Multimedia evocations of sites are common: it is the only way to see excavated tomb frescos too sensitive to light and air to be removed from the underground. And it is common practice substitute copies of famous works of art in museums when the originals are unavailable. For Westerners addicted to the concept of authenticity, to the romance of “the real thing,” the idea of a primarily digital experience of Mogaoku is hard, if not impossible to accept. Art is, after all, about the aura attached to uniqueness. The art experience depends on being there.
arts/design,Paradoxically this insistence on authenticity is also the impulse driving contemporary conservation. At whatever cost, the integrity of the original must be preserved. Yet conservators know that often the only way to protect the “real thing” is by restricting access to it, by forcing an audience to accept a condition of not being there, by substituting virtual auras for actual ones. And so the contradictions pile up, and change inexorably goes on. At dawn on the morning I am leaving Mogaoku, it is quiet. I watch the sun hit the hard-to-reach caves high up on the cliff. Then I watch buses of Chinese tourists arrive from hotels in town, coming early, before the heat of day. Several are teenagers or a little older, plugged into iPods, taking photos with cellphones, in an antic mood. Together they troop across the barrier bridge that leads to the caves. They’re wearing hard-soled shoes. They laugh, some inside joke. They do not mind making noise. Exactly what they are looking for at Mogaoku, or will find, is hard to know; they seem so distracted, so somewhere else. Yet just before reaching the cave they stop and linger, as do other, older visitors, over a small text-and-photo display. It documents Wang Yuanlu’s presence here a century ago and describes the visits of Stein, Pelliot and Warner and what they took away. Maybe this is what Mogaoku means to its new audience: not art, not faith but cultural heritage with a loaded political history.
arts/design,As for me, I’m heading to the airport. I consider making a quick return to the Nine-Story Temple before I leave, but head in the opposite direction, toward the desert. From afar I had noticed a scattering of small stupa towers and hutlike shrines just beyond Mogaoku’s boundaries. Mr. Liu said they were memorials to monks and priests who had died at Mogaoku, Wang Yuanlu  being one. There were lots of markers once, but most have been worn down. They are made from the same stuff as almost all of the cave sculptures, air-dried earth mixed with grass. Outdoors it cracks and breaks easily; chips from the memorials litter the ground. Two of the shrine huts have crude little frescos in shelflike niches, with sand silted up in the corners. I brush some away. Well, I think to myself, you made it here, someplace you always wanted to go. Is it what you hoped it would be? Yes, exactly as I’d hoped. Will you return? Life is busy; time is a problem; the distance is great. Besides, if I did return, it wouldn’t be the same. It would change, wouldn’t it? On some impulse I look back at the cliff, toward the face of the great stone Buddha behind his window, but I can’t see his eyes.
sports/baseball,A Taste of October, Disappointment Included, for the Mets - The New York Times After surviving four losing seasons as the Mets manager, Terry Collins will not allow himself, even with his team in first place in mid-August, to become wistful about playoff baseball at Citi Field. Collins said he did not check each night to see if the second-place Washington Nationals have lost, which they have been doing a lot of lately. He plans only a few days forward, such as for this week’s series at Baltimore and Colorado, but not for possible postseason games, with their comeback rallies, defensive gems and a home crowd that rarely sits down. “I’ve learned you can’t look very far forward,” Collins said on Saturday afternoon before the Mets fell, 5-3, in 14 innings to the Pittsburgh Pirates in a game that had many elements of October baseball. Perhaps it’s a sound strategy by Collins to refrain from playing the soothsayer. Saturday’s loss dropped the Mets to 0-5 against the Pirates this season, and it was their second straight extra-inning defeat. The Mets are 7-19 against all the National League division and wild-card leaders. “We played hard, we played well,” Collins said. “We get the homestand off to a good start, you lose two extra-inning games, it’s tough.” The Pirates jumped out to an early lead on Jon Niese, who had pitched as well as any of the Mets’ starters since the beginning of June.
sports/baseball,Entering Saturday, Niese had lowered his E.R.A. by almost a full run in that span and delivered quality starts in 11 of his last 12 outings (the one blip came on the day that Niese’s wife was in labor). Last week, after the Mets swept the Rockies in a four-game series at Citi Field, the Colorado All-Star Nolan Arenado praised the Mets for having four No. 1 pitchers. It’s not surprising to hear such talk about three of those starters — Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard — but the fourth ace implied by Arenado was Niese, who pitches consistently but not in the overpowering fashion of his cohorts. Collins attributed Niese’s recent string of success to his ability to register outs early in the count and avoid home runs. He was unable to do either over the first three innings on Saturday. In the first inning, Aramis Ramirez swung on the first pitch he saw and clocked his first home run since being traded to the Pirates from the Milwaukee Brewers on July 23, putting Niese in an early 2-0 hole. Two innings later, Gregory Polanco launched a solo home run off the right-field foul pole on a first-pitch curveball. Niese nearly lost his composure after Ramirez’s homer. The previous batter, Andrew McCutchen, had taken a close pitch with two strikes that was called a ball, and he eventually walked. Niese, believing the inning should have been over, vehemently argued with the home-plate umpire, Bob Davidson.
sports/baseball,“I think Jon thought he had a strikeout, for sure, and then Ramirez jumped all over the next pitch,” Collins said. “That was certainly two big pitches in the game right there.” Niese did not allow the Pirates to score again and departed after the sixth inning with another quality start, having given up five hits and striking out five. The Mets responded in the seventh, when Juan Uribe led off with a home run to center field, and Michael Conforto launched a two-run home run into right field to tie the score at 3-3. The bullpen blanked the Pirates for seven innings, backed by deft defense. In the ninth, Sean Rodriguez doubled to left-center field. As the ball caromed against the wall, Rodriguez tried to stretch the hit into a triple, but Yoenis Cespedes nailed him at third with an off-balance laser throw from near the warning track. Collins said he had never seen a comparable throw. “We all heard he’s got a great arm, and boy, he showed it on that play,” Collins said. “What an accurate throw from way out there. They say he’s special and we’re seeing lots of signs of it.” As fine as Cespedes’s throw was, it was ultimately overshadowed by a defensive lapse that doomed the Mets in the 14th. Francisco Cervelli doubled to open the inning, and Starling Marte reached on a fielder’s choice when Daniel Murphy fielded a chopper to first but then questionably tried to throw out Cervelli, who was safe at third. After Pedro Florimon was called in to pinch-run for Cervelli, singles by Rodriguez and Chris Stewart drove in the two runs that proved the difference.
sports/baseball,INSIDE PITCH After missing four straight games, LUCAS DUDA pinch-hit in the 12th inning. Duda said before the game he hoped to return full time for a series with the Baltimore Orioles beginning Tuesday. ...STEVEN MATZ threw 23 pitches in one inning for Class A Port St. Lucie in his first start since being placed on the disabled list July 6 with a partly torn left lateral muscle. Matz allowed one earned run on three hits and struck out two batters. In the same game, DAVID WRIGHT played third base for seven innings and finished 0 for 3 with a walk and a run scored.
upshot,Where Young College Graduates Are Choosing to Live - The New York Times When young college graduates decide where to move, they are not just looking at the usual suspects, like New York, Washington and San Francisco. Other cities are increasing their share of these valuable residents at an even higher rate and have reached a high overall percentage, led by Denver, San Diego, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore., according to a report published Monday by City Observatory, a new think tank. And as young people continue to spurn the suburbs for urban living, more of them are moving to the very heart of cities — even in economically troubled places like Buffalo and Cleveland. The number of college-educated people age 25 to 34 living within three miles of city centers has surged, up 37 percent since 2000, even as the total population of these neighborhoods has slightly shrunk. Some cities are attracting young talent while their overall population falls, like Pittsburgh and New Orleans. And in a reversal, others that used to be magnets, like Atlanta and Charlotte, are struggling to attract them at the same rate. Even as Americans over all have become less likely to move, young, college-educated people continue to move at a high clip — about a million cross state lines each year, and these so-called young and the restless don’t tend to settle down until their mid-30s. Where they end up provides a map of the cities that have a chance to be the economic powerhouses of the future.
upshot,“There is a very strong track record of places that attract talent becoming places of long-term success,” said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard and author of “Triumph of the City.” “The most successful economic development policy is to attract and retain smart people and then get out of their way.” The economic effects reach beyond the work the young people do, according to Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of “The New Geography of Jobs.” For every college graduate who takes a job in an innovation industry, he found, five additional jobs are eventually created in that city, such as for waiters, carpenters, doctors, architects and teachers. “It’s a type of growth that feeds on itself — the more young workers you have, the more companies are interested in locating their operations in that area and the more young people are going to move there,” he said. About 25 percent more young college graduates live in major metropolitan areas today than in 2000, which is double the percentage increase in cities’ total population. All the 51 biggest metros except Detroit have gained young talent, either from net migration to the cities or from residents graduating from college, according to the report. It is based on data from the federal American Community Survey and written by Joe Cortright, an economist who runs City Observatory and Impresa, a consulting firm on regional economies.
upshot,Denver has become one of the most powerful magnets. Its population of the young and educated is up 47 percent since 2000, nearly double the percentage increase in the New York metro area. And 7.5 percent of Denver’s population is in this group, more than the national average of 5.2 percent and more than anywhere but Washington, the Bay Area and Boston. Denver has many of the tangible things young people want, economists say, including mountains, sunshine and jobs in booming industries like tech. Perhaps more important, it also has the ones that give cities the perception of cultural cool, like microbreweries and bike-sharing and an acceptance of marijuana and same-sex marriage. “With lots of cultural things to do and getting away to the mountains, you can have the work-play balance more than any place I’ve ever lived,” said Colleen Douglass, 27, a video producer at Craftsy, a start-up with online classes for crafts. “There’s this really thriving start-up scene here, and the sense we can be in a place we love and work at a cool new company but not live in Silicon Valley.” Other cities that have had significant increases in a young and educated population and that now have more than their share include San Diego, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore. At the other end of the spectrum are the cities where less than 4 percent of the population are young college graduates. Among those, Detroit lost about 10 percent of this group, while Providence gained just 6 percent and Memphis 10 percent.
upshot,Atlanta, one of the biggest net gainers of young graduates in the 1990s, has taken a sharp turn. Its young, educated population has increased just 2.8 percent since 2000, significantly less than its overall population. It is suffering the consequences of overenthusiasm for new houses and new jobs before the crash, economists say. The population of young, educated people in Dallas, Charlotte and Raleigh is also growing more slowly than their populations as a whole. The effects of the migration of the young and the restless are most vividly seen in urban cores. In 1980, young adults were 10 percent more likely than other people to live in these areas, according to the report from City Observatory, which is sponsored by the Knight Foundation. In 2010, they were 51 percent more likely, and those with college degrees were 126 percent more likely. The trend extends to all the largest metropolitan areas except Detroit and Birmingham, Ala. Of the metropolitan areas with the most populous city centers, Washington and Philadelphia showed the largest increases of young adults living there, at 75 and 78 percent. Other cities that have made big gains in that category are Baltimore, Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Miami and St. Louis. Washington also had the largest share of young college graduates over all, at 8.1 percent. “They want something exciting, culturally fun, involving a lot of diversity — and their fathers’ suburban lifestyle doesn’t seem to be all that thrilling to many of them,” Mr. Glaeser said.
upshot,How many eventually desert the city centers as they age remains to be seen, but demographers predict that many will stay. They say that could not only bolster city economies, but also lead to decreases in crime and improvements in public schools. If the trends continue, places like Pittsburgh and Buffalo could develop a new reputation — as role models for resurgence.
garden,Faythe Levine, the Ambassador of Do-It-Yourself - The New York Times MILWAUKEE THE entrepreneurial   spirit of the modern crafts girl should not be underestimated. Faythe Levine, a 30-year-old gallerist, collector, maker and all-around booster of the indie-D.I.Y. crafts movement began six years ago with some sock monkeys and a handstitched felt owl. Today, Ms. Levine, whose tattooed arms are twined with more hearts, flowers and lettering than a crewelwork sampler, is the proprietor of a crafts store and gallery, as well as the prime documentarian and patron saint of what she calls the handmade nation. She is cited in academic journals, quoted in magazines and newspapers, appears on TV and has been a keynote speaker at arts symposiums. Back in 2002, however, Ms. Levine was a sometime artist who made punk rock zines. That year, she organized an art show of sock monkeys in her home,  sock monkeys being universally appealing objects requiring not much medium, she explained, mostly just socks. She had 80 submissions, most of which sold. The next year, she began making stuffed felt owls and selling them online; the success of the business — she had orders for 200 at a time — wreaked havoc on her neck and back.  Before long, she found herself knee-deep in the  alt-crafts world, attending its Lollapalooza-like events  and becoming a part of a tight, mostly female, quasi-political community.
garden,“I was going to all these fairs and I remember thinking: Something big is happening. This has to be documented,” Ms. Levine said. “People were writing about it, magazines were starting,” she said, referring to publications  like ReadyMade, which started in 2001 and contained projects like Slayer T-shirt pillows, as well as newer magazines like Make and Craft. “Handmade Nation: The Rise of DIY, Art, Craft and Design,” a feature-length documentary that she financed largely on credit cards, will be shown at festivals and museums early next year. The film (handmadenationmovie.com), which has a cute-spooky soundtrack by Ms. Levine’s band, Wooden Robot (that’s  Ms. Levine on the musical saw), portrays the handiwork of groups like Houston-based Knitta (which ties knitted “graffiti” tubes around street lamps) and Jenny Hart’s Sublime Stitching company in Austin  (which produces and sells embroidery patterns of space aliens, hypodermic needles and human organs). It is a sweet-toned record of a new and growing community, one with its own esthetic, lifestyle and economy. “If you don’t like the culture you’re in,” said one young woman at the Renegade Craft Fair in Chicago, voicing the movement’s anti-industrial, anti-institutional and highly entrepreneurial manifesto, “you have to create your own.” An eight-minute teaser that Ms. Levine posted on YouTube in 2006 caught the attention of the Princeton Architectural Press, which commissioned a book, out this month, with the same title as the film. (Ms. Levine wrote it with her friend Cortney Heimerl, another crafter and curator.)
garden,As of this week, the YouTube teaser has had nearly 90,000 views.   Meanwhile Etsy (etsy.com), the online department store for the D.I.Y. set, which claims to have had a million users since 2005, recently received a cash infusion of $27 million from a group of investors led by Accel Partners, a venture capital group that has also invested in Facebook. Home stores like Urban Outfitters and, to a lesser extent, West Elm, continue to limn the handmade look — the woodland creatures, the deadpan-delicate drawings of nature scenes, “the whole cuteness factor,” as Ms. Levine put it — in many of their products. Back in Milwaukee, though, Ms. Levine is just trying to pay the rent, cheerfully juggling commitments that sometimes help her do that and sometimes don’t: band practice; an artist’s residency; independent curating; the “Handmade Nation” book tour (Princeton Architectural Press is printing 20,000 copies, a huge number for the house); and other speaking engagements. Then there’s  the administration of Art vs. Craft, the crafts fair she started here in 2004, and running the Paper Boat Boutique and Gallery, a store she owns with a friend, Kim Kisiolek, which sells handmade objects. She’d like to pay off those credit cards, too ($30,000 would about do it, she said). For a year and a half, Ms. Levine and her boyfriend, Nathan Lilley, a guitar player in an indie rock band, have been living in a large, airy apartment above the store, in a hundred-year-old brick building that used to house a bar, once the requisite business on nearly every corner of her working-class neighborhood.
garden,The apartment is filled with her “addictions,” as she calls her collections of handmade books, zines, records, paintings, drawings, Outsider art and objects like a crocheted anatomical heart by Merrilee Challiss,  an Alabama artist, and a hand-stitched stuffed yellow lion she bought for $50 at a store called ReForm School in Los Angeles. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Levine wore cowboy boots and a vintage Liberty print dress, its demure flowers a counterpoint to her extensive body art, much of it paid for by bartering artwork. This particular collection —  of tattoos — was started when she was 17. “I’m lucky my taste hasn’t changed,” she said, pulling off a boot to reveal her latest, a zebra face with a circus headdress that had been inked onto her left calf and was still a bit scabby. The surface area of one’s skin provides a built-in limit for the collector of tattoos. If one collects three-dimensional objects, however, one is limited only by the ability to pay for storage. “I have enough for four houses,” Ms. Levine said. “In dreamland, I would open a museum.” She pointed out some of her favorite objects, like a picture by Mike Brodie, a train-hopping photographer, “of my friend Jessie’s shack, which she built from garbage in North Carolina” and a sequined coyote pelt hanging over her bed. (“Sequined taxidermy, how awesome is that!”) On a linoleum table in the dining room, a mushroom-bedecked vase, crocheted doily and assemblage of tiny carved wooden critters offered the complete ironic-cute dialectic that is the visual arsenal of the modern D.I.Y. esthetic.
garden,“My whole place is saturated in it,” she admitted. Ms. Levine grew up in Los Angeles and Seattle, with parents who were as much at home in the alternative world as she. Her father, Rick Merlin Levine, is an astrologer whose work is syndicated to AOL and Google; her mother, Suzanne Wechsler,  is an organic dairy farmer. “They were always pretty supportive of any creative urge I had,” Ms. Levine said. Her “gateway drug” into the handmade life, she said, was the zine culture of the underground punk rock scene. That world,  with its vegan anarchist collective restaurants and plywood punk houses, its handmade record covers and hand-lettered, stapled newsletters, and its network of fans connected by old-world skills like letter writing,  was a Luddite’s paradise of 21st-century homemakers and do-it-yourselfers. “Everything is mass-produced,” Ms. Levine said. “Here were these people doing things the hard way, making these amazing things. It was the incredibly awesome idea that people were taking the time to do this, and that I could do it, too.” The democratic world view of the modern crafter — the unschooled, technique-and-judgment-free energy of it all — is what pulls many in. “I’m no seamstress, I can’t hem anything, and I’m too impatient to learn how to knit or crochet,” Ms. Levine said, “but I love just stitching.” It is also what irritates old-school craftspeople, those who might have come out of the American studio crafts movement of the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s. Yet their ideals are the same, according to Andrew Wagner, the editor of American Craft magazine, which redesigned itself last year in an attempt to bridge the two worlds.
garden,Mr. Wagner, a founding editor of Dwell magazine, went on to say, “It’s still about working outside the mainstream, and making a living doing what you love. We saw this huge new movement, which Faythe is cast as sort of the poster child for, and it and the old guard weren’t communicating.” There was, Mr. Wagner said, some real hostility: “The old guard was saying: It took me 20 years to master my craft, and these kids think they can start by just stitching owls.” “It would be incorrect to say there’s nothing of quality coming out of the D.I.Y. world,” he continued, “but what they bring to the table is what’s important. Their energy is infectious, which is why I call D.I.Y. the punk rock of the craft world.” In the current issue of American Craft, an article titled “Let ’Em Eat Cake,” chews over the state of the crazy quilt it has become: the fairs awash in money from corporate sponsors, the huge market for the objects sold there and the confusion that has arisen for the makers. Is a handmade object still subversive if buyers are willing to pay more for it than the maker could afford to pay herself? Do the tight bonds of the community and its micro-economies trump the appetite of mainstream culture for the authenticity those bonds and economies represent?
garden,“The handmade look is definitely a trend everywhere, from the art world to the stores,” Ms. Levine said. “But I think it helps the community, because someone can go to Urban Outfitters and then to a craft fair and relate that look back. It makes it all stronger.” Still, she said, “I do understand the turn-offs. If you see 100 owls, it’s hard not to get annoyed and bitter.” Ms. Levine, who receives hundreds of submissions from makers who want to be shown in her gallery, does see a lot of owls. “But even when I turn people down,” she said, “I want to send a message: Don’t stop. What matters is that people keep making things.”
fashion,On Instagram, the Summer You’re Not Having - The New York Times And how has your summer been so far? Have you been frolicking in the Hamptons with an Academy Award-winning actress? No? Then you have clearly not been having as good a time as Amy Schumer, who, as reported by Vanity Fair in an article titled “See Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Schumer Together on the Summer Vacation of Our Dreams,” documented on her Instagram account a trip she recently took with Ms. Lawrence, posting a blurry shot of herself and Ms. Lawrence on a Jet Ski. (There was also one of the two forming the top and bottom of a human pyramid on the deck of what appeared to be a rather sizable vessel.) Did you have a chance to drift on a yacht off the coast of Ibiza with a rotating cast of guests that included Anne Hathaway, Olivia Palermo and a handful of male models? No? Then you need to become friends with Valentino Garavani, who, as shown in photos organized under the Instagram hashtag #tmblue2015, has dedicated himself to a life of maritime leisure, replete with photogenic and oft-photographed pals, a cheeky dog named Poppy and casually elegant clothes that seem straight out of a fall editorial. Maybe you were busy attending concerts in Britain with a couple of supermodels and an international pop star? No?
fashion,Then it’s probably time for you to send in your application to join Taylor Swift’s high-profile girl gang. Members of the squad, which include Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and Martha Hunt, organized a short concert tour in June, hopping between music performances in London and the Glastonbury Music Festival via helicopter. Is all this bringing out the envious side of you? You’re not alone. The fear of missing out, which has spawned the #FOMO hashtag, has for years been identified as a prime side effect for the millions of people who have Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat accounts. Yet the condition seems sharper and more pronounced in summer, when various combinations of celebrities join forces; escape to shimmering sunshine-soaked locales; and document their escapades on social platforms. It’s hard to ignore the underlying message: They’re having a fabulous summer while you, poor soul trapped in a grim cubicle, are not. “Not only am I not on this epic trip in Cannes, but I’m also not on this yacht in Cannes with Gigi and Bella Hadid and Hailey Baldwin,” said Emily Tess Katz, 25, a Huffington Post associate editor. “It exacerbates the feeling. I can’t help but have the delusion that they would enjoy me there.” Every day brings a new assortment of images — silhouettes against the sunset, scantily clad bodies floating in clear blue waters, plates piled high with fresh seafood and luscious fruit — from destinations around the world.
fashion,Italy, for example, seems to have had a particularly Instagram-worthy year, hosting Derek Blasberg and Karlie Kloss in Positano, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend in Naples and Giovanna Battaglia on the island of Panarea. “It’s such a constant stream of things coming in through Instagram and Facebook,” said Joshua Galbraith, 22, who works in operations at a New York City law firm and checks Instagram two to five times a day. “If someone takes a really good picture and the colors are radiant and people’s skin is glistening, you want to see that place.” The extent to which the subjects of summer’s most enviable photos are actually enjoying themselves is difficult to gauge. But on platforms like Instagram, the point is rarely to depict reality. Filters soften harsh lighting and captions hint (often vaguely) at fun that can’t be captured in words. “People try to create their most desirable selves online,” said Max Wedding, 24, who has been stuck working one full-time and two part-time jobs in Portland, Ore., this summer and has watched longingly as his friends and family made time for long and short trips away. “They want to create a self that looks like it’s having as much fun as possible. The mundane middle ground is lost.” A study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General in February measured the emotional effects of Facebook use, finding that passively using the platform (scrolling through your feed and looking at people’s posts the way you would on Instagram) enhances envy, which in turn makes people feel worse over all.
fashion,Ethan Kross, 35, a researcher on the study and an associate professor and director at the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory at the University of Michigan, said: “There’s a tendency to curate the way we appear online. Constantly seeing all these positive developments in people’s lives is not necessarily good for one’s emotional well-being.” But it’s not all bad. Maureen Dahl, 22, a client-services technician, experienced deep vacation envy this summer after she was hit by a car in May and all her planned trips were derailed. Ms. Dahl suffered a fractured femur, tibia and pelvis and a torn meniscus. It was six weeks before she was able to move around on her own using crutches and three months before she could drive again. Ms. Dahl, who this summer has been checking Instagram 15 to 20 times a day, and follows the Kardashians as well as some of the members of the TV show “The Real Housewives of New York City,” explained the upside of seeing all the trips showing up on her feed: “It’s definitely motivated me to get better and push myself to do things that I might not have been comfortable with.” Instead of wallowing in her immobility, Ms. Dahl has looked closer to her home base, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and found ways to capture the excitement she sees in the virtual world by spending time downtown or heading to the city’s racecourse.
fashion,Her instincts reflect a finding of the Facebook study and one other  that has been linked to it. “What we find is that interacting with other people directly, face-to-face or talking to someone on the phone, has the exact opposite effect on how people feel,” Dr. Kross said. “It’s an improvement of well-being.” The cure for Instagram-induced vacation envy, it seems, is a return to pleasures IRL (In Real Life).

world/middleeast,U.N., Fearing a Polio Epidemic in Syria, Moves to Vaccinate Millions of Children - The New York Times United Nations officials said Friday that they were mobilizing to vaccinate 2.5 million young children in Syria and more than eight million others in the region to combat what they fear could be an explosive outbreak of polio, the incurable viral disease that cripples and kills, which has reappeared in the war-ravaged country for the first time in more than a dozen years. The officials said that the discovery a few weeks ago of a cluster of paralyzed young children in Deir al-Zour, a heavily contested city in eastern Syria, had prompted their alarm, and that tests conducted by both the government and rebel sides strongly suggested that the children had been afflicted with polio. The possibility of a polio epidemic in Syria, where the once-vaunted public health system has collapsed after 31 months of political upheaval and war, came as the United Nations is increasingly struggling with the problem of how to deliver basic emergency aid to millions of deprived civilians there. Valerie Amos, the top relief official at the United Nations, told the Security Council on Friday that combatants on both sides of the conflict had essentially ignored the Council’s Oct. 2 directive that they must give humanitarian workers access to all areas in need.
world/middleeast,Speaking to reporters afterward, Ms. Amos said she had expressed to the Council’s members “my deep disappointment that the progress that we had hoped to see on the ground as a result of that statement has not happened, and in fact what we are seeing is a deepening of the crisis.” Dr. Bruce Aylward, the assistant director general for polio and emergencies at the World Health Organization, which is helping to lead the new polio vaccination effort in Syria, said officials at the agency were taking no chances and assuming that the 20 paralyzed children in Deir al-Zour were polio victims. “This is polio until proven otherwise,” he said in a telephone interview from the group’s headquarters in Geneva. Despite the war, Dr. Aylward said he believed that both sides understood the urgent need for repeated vaccinations of all young children because polio can spread indiscriminately and is so difficult to eradicate. Nonetheless, he said, it remained unclear whether the vaccination effort, in all parts of Syria, would be impeded by the conflict’s chaos and politics. “The virus is the kind of virus that finds vulnerable populations,” he said, “and the combination of vulnerability and low immunization coverage, that is a time bomb. There is a real risk of this exploding into an outbreak with hundreds of cases.”
world/middleeast,The World Health Organization, working with Unicef and other aid groups, has organized a plan to administer repeated oral doses of polio vaccine in concentric geographical circles, starting with children in Deir al-Zour and eventually reaching western Iraq, southern Turkey, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Egypt. In Lebanon, home to more than 700,000 Syrian refugees, public health officials said Friday that they were undertaking a related effort to vaccinate all children under age 5. Altogether, Dr. Aylward said, more than 10 million young children in the Middle East would get polio vaccinations over the next several weeks. The World Health Organization has spent 25 years trying to eradicate polio. In recent years, the disease’s presence had narrowed to just three countries — Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan — from more than 125 when the campaign began in 1988. The virus is highly infectious and mainly affects children younger than 5. Within hours, it can cause irreversible paralysis or even death if breathing muscles are immobilized. The only effective treatment is prevention, the World Health Organization says on its Web site, through multiple doses of a vaccine. While the source of the Syrian polio strain remained unclear, public health experts said the jihadists who had entered Syria to fight the government of President Bashar al-Assad may have been carriers. Dr. Aylward said there were some indications that the strain had originated in Pakistan. He cited the recent discovery of the Pakistani strain in sewage in Egypt, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.
world/middleeast,The Syria aid crisis portrayed by Ms. Amos in her Security Council briefing reflected new levels of frustration over the Council’s inability to act decisively on the conflict, despite its binding — and so far successful — Sept. 27 resolution on the dismantling of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal. By contrast, the Council’s Oct. 2 statement requesting that all combatants in Syria protect civilians and allow unfettered access for humanitarian aid has no enforcement power. “This is a race against time,” Ms. Amos said. “Three weeks have passed since the adoption of the Council’s statement, with little change to report.” Ms. Amos told the Council that the Syrian government had withheld approval of more than 100 visas for United Nations staff members and members of other international aid groups, and had restricted workers from operating in areas with the greatest need. She also said as many as 2,000 armed opposition groups in Syria had made travel within the country increasingly dangerous. Kidnappings of humanitarian workers are increasingly common, she said, citing an instance last week when “we had a convoy that was ready to go, but we could not get enough drivers, as they fear for their lives.”
well/live,Saunas May Be Good for Blood Pressure - The New York Times A Finnish study suggests that regular sauna visits can reduce the risk for high blood pressure. The study, in the American Journal of Hypertension, included 1,621 middle-aged men with normal blood pressure who were followed for an average of 25 years. During that time, 251 developed hypertension. Compared to those who reported one sauna session a week or less, those who took two to three sessions were 24 percent less likely to have hypertension, and four to seven visits a week reduced the risk by 46 percent. The study controlled for body mass index, alcohol consumption, resting heart rate, smoking, family history of hypertension and other variables. The study is observational and does not prove cause and effect, but the senior author, Dr. Jari A. Laukkanen, a professor of medicine at the University of Eastern Finland, suggested several possible mechanisms. The warmth of the sauna, he said, improves the flexibility of the blood vessels which eases blood flow, and the warmth and subsequent cooling down of a typical Finnish sauna induces a general relaxation that is helpful in moderating blood pressure. Also, sweating removes excess fluid, acting as a natural diuretic. Diuretics are among the oldest drugs used to treat hypertension. “This is good news,” he said, laughing quietly. “A healthy thing that is pleasant to do, and involves no sacrifice.”
science,On ‘Jeopardy!’ Watson Win Is All but Trivial - The New York Times YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. — In the end, the humans on “Jeopardy!” surrendered meekly. Facing certain defeat at the hands of a room-size I.B.M. computer on Wednesday evening, Ken Jennings, famous for winning 74 games in a row on the TV quiz show, acknowledged the obvious. “I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords,” he wrote on his video screen, borrowing a line from a “Simpsons” episode. From now on, if the answer is “the computer champion on “Jeopardy!,” the question will be, “What is Watson?” For I.B.M., the showdown was not merely a well-publicized stunt and a $1 million prize, but proof that the company has taken a big step toward a world in which intelligent machines will understand and respond to humans, and perhaps inevitably, replace some of them. Watson, specifically, is a “question answering machine” of a type that artificial intelligence researchers have struggled with for decades — a computer akin to the one on “Star Trek” that can understand questions posed in natural language and answer them. Watson showed itself to be imperfect, but researchers at I.B.M. and other companies are already developing uses for Watson’s technologies that could have a significant impact on the way doctors practice and consumers buy products. “Cast your mind back 20 years and who would have thought this was possible?” said Edward Feigenbaum, a Stanford University computer scientist and a pioneer in the field.
science,In its “Jeopardy!” project, I.B.M. researchers were tackling a game that requires not only encyclopedic recall, but also the ability to untangle convoluted and often opaque statements, a modicum of luck, and quick, strategic button pressing. The contest, which was taped in January here at the company’s T. J. Watson Research Laboratory before an audience of I.B.M. executives and company clients, played out in three televised episodes concluding Wednesday. At the end of the first day, Watson was in a tie with Brad Rutter, another ace human player, at $5,000 each, with Mr. Jennings trailing with $2,000. But on the second day,  Watson went on a tear. By night’s end, Watson had a commanding lead with a total of $35,734, compared with Mr. Rutter’s $10,400 and Mr. Jennings’s $4,800. Victory was not cemented until late in the third match, when Watson was in Nonfiction. “Same category for $1,200,” it said in a manufactured tenor, and lucked into a Daily Double. Mr. Jennings grimaced. Even later in the match, however, had Mr. Jennings won another key Daily Double it might have come down to Final Jeopardy, I.B.M. researchers acknowledged. The final tally was $77,147 to Mr. Jennings’s $24,000 and Mr. Rutter’s $21,600. More than anything, the contest was a vindication for the academic field of artificial intelligence, which began with great promise in the 1960s with the vision of creating a thinking machine and which became the laughingstock of Silicon Valley in the 1980s, when a series of heavily financed start-up companies went bankrupt.
science,Despite its intellectual prowess, Watson was by no means omniscient. On Tuesday evening during Final Jeopardy, the category was U.S. Cities and the clue was: “Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero; its second largest for a World War II battle.” Watson drew guffaws from many in the television audience when it responded “What is Toronto?????” The string of question marks indicated that the system had very low confidence in its response, I.B.M. researchers said, but because it was Final Jeopardy, it was forced to give a response. The machine did not suffer much damage. It had wagered just $947 on its result. (The correct answer is, "What is Chicago?") “We failed to deeply understand what was going on there,” said David Ferrucci, an I.B.M. researcher who led the development of Watson. “The reality is that there’s lots of data where the title is U.S. cities and the answers are countries, European cities, people, mayors. Even though it says U.S. cities, we had very little confidence that that’s the distinguishing feature.” The researchers also acknowledged that the machine had benefited from the “buzzer factor.” Both Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter are accomplished at anticipating the light that signals it is possible to “buzz in,” and can sometimes get in with virtually zero lag time. The danger is to buzz too early, in which case the contestant is penalized and “locked out” for roughly a quarter of a second.
science,Watson, on the other hand, does not anticipate the light, but has a weighted scheme that allows it, when it is highly confident, to hit the buzzer in as little as 10 milliseconds, making it very hard for humans to beat. When it was less confident, it took longer to  buzz in. In the second round, Watson beat the others to the buzzer in 24 out of 30 Double Jeopardy questions. “It sort of wants to get beaten when it doesn’t have high confidence,” Dr. Ferrucci said. “It doesn’t want to look stupid.” Both human players said that Watson’s button pushing skill was not necessarily an unfair advantage. “I beat Watson a couple of times,” Mr. Rutter said. When Watson did buzz in, it made the most of it. Showing the ability to parse language, it responded to, “A recent best seller by Muriel Barbery is called ‘This of the Hedgehog,’ ” with “What is Elegance?” It showed its facility with medical diagnosis. With the answer: “You just need a nap. You don’t have this sleep disorder that can make sufferers nod off while standing up,” Watson replied, “What is narcolepsy?” The coup de grâce came with the answer, “William Wilkenson’s ‘An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia’ inspired this author’s most famous novel.” Mr. Jennings wrote, correctly, Bram Stoker, but realized that he could not catch up with Watson’s winnings and wrote out his surrender. Both players took the contest and its outcome philosophically.
science,“I had a great time and I would do it again in a heartbeat,” said Mr. Jennings. “It’s not about the results; this is about being part of the future.” For I.B.M., the future will happen very quickly, company executives said. On Thursday it plans to announce that it will collaborate with Columbia University and the University of Maryland to create a physician’s assistant service that will allow doctors to query a cybernetic assistant. The company also plans to work with Nuance Communications Inc. to add voice recognition to the physician’s assistant, possibly making the service available in as little as 18 months. “I have been in medical education for 40 years and we’re still a very memory-based curriculum,” said Dr. Herbert Chase, a professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University who is working with I.B.M. on the physician’s assistant. “The power of Watson- like tools will cause us to reconsider what it is we want students to do.” I.B.M. executives also said they are in discussions with a major consumer electronics retailer to develop a version of Watson, named after I.B.M.’s founder, Thomas J. Watson, that would be able to interact with consumers on a variety of subjects like buying decisions and technical support. Dr. Ferrucci sees none of the fears that have been expressed by theorists and science fiction writers about the potential of computers to usurp humans.
science,“People ask me if this is HAL,” he said, referring to the computer in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” “HAL’s not the focus; the focus is on the computer on ‘Star Trek,’ where you have this intelligent information seek dialogue, where you can ask follow-up questions and the computer can look at all the evidence and tries to ask follow-up questions. That’s very cool.”
sports/golf,Next Step for Anirban Lahiri, India’s Top Golfer: U.S. Debut - The New York Times DORAL, Fla. —  First came Jordan Spieth, who won his first PGA Tour event as a teenager. He was followed by Patrick Reed, 24, who became the youngest winner of a World Golf Championships event here last year. Last month, Brooks Koepka, 24, won the Phoenix Open, and Daniel Berger, 21, lost in a playoff on Monday in the Honda Classic. Need further proof that professional golf’s youth boom is in full flower? Meet Anirban Lahiri, a 27-year-old from India who will make his United States debut this week at the Cadillac Championship at Doral. Lahiri, the No. 1 player on the Asian Tour, has four victories in the past 11 months, including the Malaysian and Indian Opens. At No. 35 in the world, Lahiri is two spots ahead of Brandt Snedeker, once fourth in the world. Lahiri is also ranked higher than major winners like Louis Oosthuizen, Jason Dufner, Webb Simpson — and Tiger Woods, whose brain he picked when Woods played an exhibition in India. “You couldn’t help but be inspired by things he did when we were kids,” Lahiri said of Woods, whose confident demeanor left a lasting imprint on the younger generation. “I’ve always believed that I can win, and I’m glad that it happened,” Lahiri said Wednesday, adding, “It’s time for me to take the next step and prove that I can compete, contend and maybe even win events like this.”
sports/golf,Nick Price, the International team captain for this year’s Presidents Cup, has been following Lahiri’s progress with great interest. Lahiri is positioned to become the first Indian player to compete in the biennial event, in October in South Korea. “Looks like he can make a big putt on a big occasion,” Price said, adding, “He’s very calm, collected, and I think he’s going to be an asset to our team.”   Lahiri did not have to blaze a trail to get here. The path he traveled was plotted by Arjun Atwal, who in 2010 became the first player from India to win a PGA Tour event. Before Atwal there was Jeev Milkha Singh, the first Indian to participate in the Masters. Singh climbed to a career high No. 29 in the world rankings in March 2009.    Great things are expected of Lahiri, who is getting a head start on his predecessors. Atwal was 37 when he won the Wyndham Championship, the same age as Singh when he crashed the world top 30.  “I would never put myself ahead of them,” said Lahiri, who recounted a conversation he had with Atwal during a tournament last year in Japan. This is what he said Atwal told him: “You know, we have done all these things that everyone looks up to. You have the opportunity to do that at 27, 28. We did it at 35, 36. So you’ve got that much more time to outdo us and outdo yourself.”
sports/golf,Lahiri was moved, and motivated, by Atwal’s words. He said he wanted to create a ripple effect that created greater participation in the game and higher expectations. “I’m getting the opportunities at a much younger age than they did, and for me, that is the greatest gift: time,” Lahiri said. He added, “So how I utilize that, how I capitalize on that opportunity, is critical for me personally in my career, but also for someone to have that is great for golf in India, as well.” India has fewer golf courses than South Florida does, and many of them, Lahiri said, were built for the Army. Because his father is a military doctor, Lahiri had access to courses that otherwise would have been off limits to him. “I think one of the issues in India, there’s not as many courses as America; it’s not as public a sport,” Lahiri said. “And yeah, a lot of the credit for my exposure to the game goes not just to my dad but also to the armed forces.” Lahiri was drawn to the game because it was a chance to spend time with his father, Dr. Tushar Lahiri, a recreational player. “I would just go out there and I would go pick up golf balls for him, and we would go chip, putt for 15 minutes because it was getting dark,” Lahiri said. “That’s how it all started.” When he took up the game, he was 8 years old. He had the impression that no other children played the sport.
sports/golf,“I was the only person on the golf course who was under the age of 30,” Lahiri said, adding: “Then I played a junior event when I was about 12. That’s the first time I saw kids my age play.” The tournament, Lahiri said, was held at Royal Calcutta Golf Club, and the fairways were the most pristine he had ever seen. “I had always teed the ball up two inches in the air because that’s the kind of grass we had on the Army courses,” he said. Lahiri said he finished fifth in the eight-player field. “It was fantastic,” he said. “My dad, he’s always been very inspirational. He said to me, ‘Look at it this way: doesn’t matter how you play; you’re going to have the opportunity to play four days on such a beautiful golf course, which you won’t get otherwise, so why don’t you just enjoy yourself?’ I think that’s the same attitude that I keep with me.”

business/media,Lions Gate Creates Chief Brand Officer Role in Bid to Extend Franchises - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — In a move that is as much about emphasizing a growth strategy as keeping a valued executive, Lions Gate Entertainment on Tuesday promoted Tim Palen to the unusual position of chief brand officer. Mr. Palen, 53, already the company’s top movie marketer, will now take on the additional task of building the studio’s hit properties — including television shows — into broader brands and franchises. Lions Gate is home to movies like “The Hunger Games” and series like “Orange Is the New Black.” Although increasingly trendy at big companies — Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser, last year renamed its marketing divisions “brand management” — studios do not typically have brand chiefs. Instead, movies are usually marketed as stand-alone entities, with consumer products and theme park extensions handled by disparate divisions that don’t always communicate with one another. But studios, operating more and more like consumer products companies, have become more focused on brand building as they seek to compete for consumer time and attention. The Walt Disney Company, which has centered its movie business on brands like Pixar and Marvel, is in many ways the model. Lions Gate, for instance, sees the potential for tens and maybe hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental profit by pushing into areas like location-based entertainment: theme parks, theatrical productions or touring shows with costumes and props. A “Hunger Games”-related exhibition opens in Times Square in Manhattan on July 1.
business/media,In addition to the “Hunger Games” series, Lions Gate controls the “Divergent” and “Twilight” films, and the studio is working on potential new franchises tied to the Power Rangers toys and Homer’s “The Odyssey.” Lions Gate’s TV shows include “The Royals” and “Mad Men,” which recently finished its AMC run. In a statement attributed to the studio’s top two movie executives, Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger, Mr. Palen was called “truly best in class, one of the most creative and strategic marketing executives in the business.”
garden,At Doyle Auctions, a Sale of Arch, Frayed Elegance - The New York Times KEITH IRVINE turned 80 last week and threw himself a garage sale to celebrate. “A very elegant garage sale,” he said dryly, raising silvery eyebrows. A day into his ninth decade, he spent the morning moving furniture at Doyle New York, the genteel auction house on East 87th Street, in preparation for the sale of about 200 of his antiques and decorative objects, which was held yesterday. He was putting the finishing touches on the displays he had assembled for the sale; in one was a red Louis XVI-style chair he seemed particularly reluctant to part with. “I could just eat that chair,” he said sadly, patting it. “Chippy made me do it,” he continued, referring to his wife. “She said she keeps bumping into things.” Mr. Irvine, a Scotsman who has practiced English decorating with a theatrical flair for more than 60 years for clients like Katharine Graham, Jacqueline Onassis and Pat Buckley, has recently moved his business from Manhattan to his farmhouse in Putnam County, north of the city, and winnowed the results of a lifetime’s worth of voracious collecting. While his birthday may have marked him, as he likes to say, as “the oldest living decorator in captivity,” Mr. Irvine said he had no plans to retire, although Thomas Fleming, his business partner of nearly five decades, left the firm last year. Saddened by their parting and a year of ill health, Mr. Irvine said he is glad to be finally looking at the back of what he described as “my annus horribilis, as the Queen said.”
garden,Nearly half a century ago, the English country house look brought fame to Parish-Hadley and other American companies, yet their versions of it were paler and a little more restrained than the originals they aspired to. It was in Mr. Irvine’s interiors, lapped with chintz, paisley throws, Staffordshire pottery, Regency chairs and armadas of pillows, that you could glimpse the real thing: rooms that were eccentric, a bit arch and oh-so-slightly frayed. If Sister Parish, the grande dame of American decorating, created interiors that spoke softly and whispered of privilege and provenance, Mr. Irvine was after a bolder effect, and tended to work for clients who had the stomach for it. “We all borrow from the Old World,” said the designer Mario Buatta, who once worked as Mr. Irvine’s assistant and said that Mr. Irvine taught him all he knows. “But Keith has the knack of the real Englishman. His settings are a little more dramatic, a little more idiosyncratic. He has flair.” Mr. Irvine was born in Scotland and educated in England. He served in Southeast Asia after World War II, where he learned a few things, like how to wear a sarong and what his life’s work would be: included in one care package from his mother was the latest Vogue and a new magazine, House & Garden, which introduced him to the idea of interior decoration. (By his own account hopeless at school, Mr. Irvine is fond of saying that he was educated by Condé Nast and Warner Brothers.) He met his wife, Chippy, at the Royal College of Art in London, after which he went to work for his hero, the autocratic and imperious English decorator John Fowler.
garden,Mr. Irvine’s first job in New York was with Sister Parish, whom he loathed. “Domineering old dictator,” he said. He lasted nine months, then set up his own business, with clients Mrs. Parish declined to work for, in 1959. Describing his own style, Mr. Irvine said, “I like an edge of grandeur, but I like it knocked down a bit.” He fingered an eight-foot-long petit-point bell pull given to him by Mr. Fowler. In front of it was a small chair, “a little piece of Edwardian nonsense,” Mr. Irvine said dismissively. “It’s not my period, but it adds a bit of sauce.” It is Mr. Irvine’s opinion that decorating right now has no sauce whatsoever, the expression of a culture that’s afraid to commit. Take, for example, he said, “the modern habit of propping pictures against the wall. It’s A, sort of pretentious and B, tentative.” He continued: “And that applies to color; they’re scared of it too. Most of the rooms today end up looking like some set piece from Crate & Barrel. I don’t mean to knock Crate & Barrel, because it’s a great resource, but you don’t have to emulate their showroom.” Mr. Irvine loves gold-framed convex Regency mirrors, anything with a key pattern, miniature furniture, Oushak rugs “that look like they’re on their last week” and needlepointed mottos on pillows. He frowned at a wooden bench upholstered in gold lamé. “That’s waterproof gold lamé, not really my thing,” he said. “That was a job that ended in tears.” He added that the client “sent a whole truckload of stuff back, saying, ‘I don’t want it and I’m not paying for it.’ ”
garden,“There used to be ladies and gentlemen,” he said. “Now they have no manners and too much money.” He stopped again at a red velvet récamier, which was freighted with a cargo of needlepoint pillows, and looked up at the Chinese painted screen behind it. Mr. Irvine said that the screen was made from painted panels and that he had found papers documenting the panels’ trip from China to a ship in Brooklyn. He used a few of the panels in the offices of the Wells Rich Greene advertising agency, which he decorated in the 1960s. He added, “When I told Mary Wells” — a principal of the agency — “she said, ‘They came from Brooklyn? Just like all of us.’ ” Mr. Irvine said he worked for Ms. Wells until one Friday night when she phoned him to say that she had bought a house in Acapulco and to ask if he would fly down the next morning with her and take a look. “I told her I don’t work on Saturdays,” Mr. Irvine said. “And Billy Baldwin did her next five houses.” “I’d rather not be devoured by my clients,” he explained. “Still, it was a stupid move.” Mr. Irvine can be balky. In the 1980s, he said he suffered a midlife crisis, which he expressed by building an addition to his early 19th-century farmhouse. The addition included a very grand ballroom, and did not include any input from his wife.
garden,“It was very irritating,” she said in a phone interview last week. Mrs. Irvine, who has written 13 books on architecture and decorative arts, took her revenge by threatening to have an image of the new wing engraved on expensive stationery emblazoned with the words “Keith’s Erection.” The stationery never materialized, and Mrs. Irvine persuaded her husband to cut the ballroom in half. Some of the objects they filled the addition with made their way to the sale at Doyle, including a tufted mahogany reading chair covered in an old tiger-print fabric, a fine example of Mr. Irvine’s credo that furniture should look as if “it’s just drifted into a room,” and not as if it was bought new for the job. Other pieces aren’t budging, like the watercolor of Mr. Irvine as Queen Victoria, painted by his wife. (That tiger-print chair sold for $2,375; the Chinese screen, $12,500. Indeed, most of the objects sold for well above their estimates: the entire sale totaled $320,775, which includes a 25 percent commission paid to the auction house, and was at the high end of the auction house’s estimate of $207,145 to $329,780.) Mr. Irvine may not be retiring, but he admitted that he is working on a roman à clef, “a polite tell-all,” he said. It’s a murder mystery, and its working title is “I Want It All.”

us,Deportation Arrest Highlights Tensions in Los Angeles on Immigration - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — Shortly after dropping off his youngest daughter at school, Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez saw lights flashing from a black car following him, signaling for him to pull over. The car was unmarked and Mr. Avelica, along with his wife and another daughter, who were also in the car, did not know why he was being stopped. Officers wearing jackets emblazoned with “police” in large yellow letters on their backs emerged and demanded that Mr. Avelica get out of the car. When he asked what he had done wrong, the officers yelled back, “Be quiet, you know you have a deportation order.” Mr. Avelica’s daughter Fatima, 13, and her mother began to cry. As Mr. Avelica, 48, stepped out of the car and was handcuffed, Fatima pulled out her cellphone and began recording the arrest. “My dad kept telling us to calm down, that everything would be O.K.,” Fatima said in an interview. “I didn’t understand what was happening and how they could have known who he was.” “Don’t cry,” her mother told her as she filmed. “We have to be strong.” As news quickly spread of Mr. Avelica’s arrest, local activists and leaders responded with anger and dismay that an arrest could happen so close to a school and in front of a child. Outraged local officials said that the tactics showed a new kind of aggressiveness from immigration agents.
us,Mr. Avelica’s case is the latest example of the growing tension building in Los Angeles between federal immigration enforcers and local officials. The fraught relationship could continue to fray as the Trump administration ramps up arrests and detentions. Local leaders in California and other parts of the country are increasingly criticizing federal immigration agents, saying their actions threaten to erode the trust between local law enforcement officials and immigrants, whom they depend on to report crimes. California officials have for years declined to help enforce immigration laws, but they do not have the power to stop roundups of immigrants living in the United States illegally. Mr. Avelica had been convicted of driving under the influence about a decade ago and was ordered deported in 2014. He has lived in the country for nearly 25 years. But it is unclear precisely why immigration officials targeted him for arrest last week. “It’s very unsettling the way things are being carried out,” said Hilda Solis, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors who represents the neighborhood east of downtown where Mr. Avelica was arrested. “This man was not an immediate danger to the community. The situation is very scary and alarming for so many of our families and there are a lot of implications for that. I think the federal actions are deliberate and they are trying to send a message.”
us,Battles over immigration enforcement between local and federal officials are playing out in other cities too. The Santa Cruz police chief, Kevin Vogel, accused Department of Homeland Security officials of lying to him after agents arrested several people for immigration violations during a raid on gang members in the city. Law enforcement officials in El Paso and Denver have also raised concerns that victims of domestic violence are no longer coming forward out of fear of being deported. The mayor in Austin, Tex., wrote a letter condemning recent immigration arrests, saying they made the city less safe. This month, the Los Angeles mayor, the City Council president and the city attorney sent a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement asking its employees to stop identifying themselves as police. The day after Mr. Avelica’s arrest, two students from the school his daughters attend, Academia Avance, were stopped by the police. Worried that rumors could spread that they had been stopped by immigration officials, Ricardo Mireles, the executive director of the school, urged students to carry school identification at all times. That was only the start of Mr. Mireles’s warnings to students. Like other public schools, Academia Avance does not know whether students or their parents immigrated legally. But last week, Mr. Mireles gathered all of the students at the small charter school and urged them to ask their parents whether they are living in the United States legally. During parent conferences in the coming days, he said, teachers will ask parents directly if they have made plans in case they are deported. As far as he knows, Fatima and her sister Yuleni are the first students at the school with a parent who has been placed in deportation proceedings. But he does not think they will be the last.
us,For now, there is no way to know how many students are undocumented immigrants or have parents who are; Mr. Mireles estimated about 20 percent. But when asked who had undocumented relatives, nearly all of the students in one junior class raised their hands. “This is a lot to ask of you, to put all this responsibility on you, but there’s no other choice,” he told the class. “You need to be prepared. The fact is that fear is being created and terrorism is being inflicted on our community. This father is not a criminal. He’s a person who has made some mistakes but proven his commitment to the United States.” After Mr. Mireles spoke to the class, one boy approached him crying, saying that his parents would not allow him to ride his bike outside because they were afraid he could be picked up. Mr. Mireles is not allowing anyone who is not a citizen to participate in a senior class trip to New York, fearful that someone could be detained at an airport. Initially, immigration officials told Mr. Avelica that he would be deported to Mexico immediately. But lawyers from the National Day Laborer Organizing Network stepped in, pressing local officials to call the field director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to voice their concerns and asking activists to do the same.
us,ICE officials said that Mr. Avelica would have been a target under the Obama administration because of his conviction and order of removal. Officers abided by the agency’s sensitive locations policy, which generally restricts arrests in schools, and stopped him about half a mile from the school, not knowing that one of the daughters remained in the car, the officials said. Since receiving his deportation order, Mr. Avelica has occasionally talked with his children about the possibility that he could be sent back to Mexico. He worked for years in restaurants, 12-hour shifts, six days a week, his family said. He tried to avoid any contact with law enforcement officials. His two adult daughters warned their younger sisters two weeks ago that he could be in danger, but they cut the conversation short before making any specific plans. Jeff Gorell, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for public safety, said the circumstances of Mr. Avelica’s arrest were concerning enough that he wanted more information. “There’s certainly heightened focus here on the activities of ICE,” he said. “Any incident that affects our neighborhoods with the kind of response that a detention gets of course gives the mayor concern. That’s one of the reasons we called immediately.” Pablo Alvarado, the executive director of the day labor organization, said the involvement from local officials probably helped keep Mr. Avelica in the country for now. He is being held at a detention center about two hours east of Los Angeles. “Political leaders are trying to understand what’s rhetoric and what’s real, but I think they are starting to see that we’re not just talking about hypothetical,” Mr. Alvarado said. “There are going to be real dilemmas for elected officials about how complicit they are willing to be.”

nyregion,Legislator in Harassment Case to Quit Albany but Not Politics - The New York Times State Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, the once-powerful Brooklyn Democratic leader who has been accused of sexual harassment by several women, said on Friday that he would resign. But his offer only inflamed an uproar over his behavior because, a few words later, he said the resignation would not take effect for five weeks, and then he would run for a seat on the New York City Council. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, whose own handling of the initial allegations against Mr. Lopez has been widely criticized, vowed to press ahead with an effort to expel Mr. Lopez from the Legislature immediately. And the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, called for an all-out effort to prevent Mr. Lopez from winning election to that body this fall. “Vito Lopez should not spend another day in office, let alone a whole month,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement. “He should resign effective immediately, and if he does not, he must be expelled.” The denunciations from the state’s leading Democratic officials demonstrated the remarkably steep fall of Mr. Lopez. Until he was publicly accused of harassment, he had been a political boss with considerable influence. In Brooklyn, he has controlled a sprawling nonprofit agency, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, that served as a de facto political machine for him and his allies. And in Albany, he had clout as chairman of the Housing Committee.
nyregion,Mr. Lopez’s determination to run for the Council also served as a reminder of the extraordinary staying power of incumbents in New York. Mr. Lopez was easily re-elected last fall, against only nominal opposition, even after he had been censured by the Assembly, and few are ruling out an election this fall to the Council. The allegations against Mr. Lopez first became public last August, when Mr. Silver announced that an investigation by the Assembly’s ethics committee had found that accusations by two women were credible. The New York Times later reported that the Assembly had previously settled two other harassment allegations against Mr. Lopez, but had not made those settlements public, and had not referred the accusations to the ethics committee. This week, the anger over Mr. Lopez’s conduct intensified after the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics issued a report saying female legislative employees had told investigators that Mr. Lopez had groped them, sought to stay in hotel rooms with them, demanded they massage him, requested that they dress in more provocative clothing and urged them to write him flattering notes. On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Silver said they wanted the Assembly to expel Mr. Lopez. Mr. Lopez, who is 71 and was elected to the Assembly in 1984, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, but on Friday morning he tried to quiet the furor by issuing a seven-sentence statement in which he said he would resign on the last scheduled day of the current legislative session.
nyregion,“Because the citizens of my district voted me back into office last November by an overwhelming majority, I feel obligated to serve out this session of the Assembly,” he said. “I therefore announce that as of June 20, 2013, the last day of the session, I resign my position.” That date was too far off for many. “Lopez is living in la-la land if he doesn’t think his actions warrant immediate resignation,” said Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat. “His lack of shame is almost as repugnant as his behavior.” The New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women not only asked for Mr. Lopez’s expulsion, but also assailed Mr. Silver for what it called “his shameful cover-up and protection of a serial harasser.” The organization also said in a statement, “Up to this point, Speaker Silver has failed the many women who were harassed by Mr. Lopez, in turn failing every woman who walks the halls of the Capitol.” Mr. Silver, who has acknowledged erring in his handling of the initial complaints against Mr. Lopez, now appears determined to move swiftly toward expulsion. (The Assembly has not expelled anyone since it ejected five socialists in the early 1920s.) On Friday afternoon, Mr. Silver circulated a draft resolution that would begin the process of expelling Mr. Lopez by asking the Assembly’s ethics committee to recommend sanctions against him. Mr. Lopez had already been stripped of his committee chairmanship and seniority privileges last August.
nyregion,“Assembly Member Lopez should no longer be in public office,” Mr. Silver’s spokesman, Michael Whyland, said. “We will move forward with our resolution on Monday.” Much of the anger on Friday was focused on Mr. Lopez’s announcement that he intended to pursue a race for the Council. He is a candidate for a seat now held by Councilwoman Diana Reyna, who cannot seek re-election because of term limits. Ms. Reyna once served as Mr. Lopez’s chief of staff, and won her seat with his backing, but later had a falling-out with him. The heavily Democratic district includes parts of Bushwick and Williamsburg, in Brooklyn, as well as Ridgewood, Queens, and overlaps significantly with Mr. Lopez’s Assembly district. His most formidable opponent in that race is another Democrat, Antonio Reynoso, who is Ms. Reyna’s chief of staff. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Reynoso said that Mr. Lopez was “as ineffective a representative as you can possibly have,” given the accusations against him, and questioned why he would seek another office. “I think it’s extremely selfish, more so than anything else,” Mr. Reynoso said. Over the last two months, Mr. Lopez has raised a little over $38,000 for his Council campaign. Mr. Reynoso has raised about $87,000 over all and has three times as much cash on hand as Mr. Lopez. The landscape for Mr. Lopez is obviously complicated: a fund-raiser that he held in April was picketed by a group of activists who held signs that read, “Let’s keep N.Y. City Council a molester-free zone.”
nyregion,Ms. Quinn, a Democratic candidate for mayor whose rise to Council speaker in 2006 was assisted by Mr. Lopez, said in a telephone interview on Friday: “Vito Lopez running for City Council is one of the most offensive things I have ever seen happen in New York City politics. I am disgusted by his behavior, and I am going to work incredibly hard to make sure he never steps foot in City Hall.” And Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, said: “It’s unconscionably laughable that he still thinks he can get elected and serve the public as an elected official. His interest in running for City Council, it just shows how out of touch with reality he is.” But Mr. Lopez is clearly undaunted. “I expect to run a vigorous campaign on the issues facing the citizens of my community and hope to continue to serve them as a member of the City Council,” Mr. Lopez said in his statement. “I believe that the voters of the community should decide who should represent them.”
upshot,Broncos’ Playoff Picture: How They Could Win Top Seed, or Lose the Division - The New York Times Upshot
us,In California, an Inmate Safety Valve, the Arts, Is Fading - The New York Times NORCO, Calif. — Fifteen men darted across the room, their faces slathered in greasepaint, reciting lines from “Tartuffe.” The stage, such as it was, was a low-ceilinged recreation room, and the cast was a troupe of felons who had just stepped in from the dusty yard of the California Rehabilitation Center. For four hours, they conducted workshops under the direction of the Actors’ Gang, an ensemble from Los Angeles, which goaded them into acting out emotions that could be put to use in the 17th-century Molière farce about, appropriately enough, a con man working a swindle. “Why are you angry?” Sabra Williams, the prison project director, demanded of the jostling lineup of actor-prisoners. “They gave me too much time!” shouted one of the inmates, Ron Reiber, his face red and veins bulging. “Now go to happy!” she said. The room burst into giddy smiles and rubbery limbs from men in prison jumpsuits. Two years ago, arts in corrections programs were a mainstay of prisons across the country, embraced by administrators as a way to channel aggression, break down racial barriers, teach social skills and prepare inmates for the outside world. There was an arts coordinator in each of the 33 California state prisons, overseeing a rich variety of theater, painting and dance. But these programs have become a fading memory, casualties of the budget crises that have overwhelmed state and local governments nationwide. Nowhere is that truer than here, where prisons are so overcrowded that the Supreme Court in May ordered the state to start releasing inmates.
us,“The artist facilitator — that position was eliminated,” said Violette Peters, who filled the role for four years at this medium-security prison in the desert, which, with 4,410 inmates, is at double its capacity. “So now I’m a corrections case analyst. I work in the records department, which has nothing to do with the arts programs.” Only two prison arts programs are left in California, and both rely on volunteers and private contributions. The one here is run by the Actors’ Gang, whose artistic director is the actor Tim Robbins. Mr. Robbins has become nearly as familiar a figure at the prison as the warden himself. (The actor, walking through the prison yards, sets off a rustle of recognition among inmates who recall his movie role as a prisoner in “The Shawshank Redemption.”) Laurie Brooks, the executive director of the William James Association, which runs an acting workshop in San Quentin State Prison, said these programs were first championed in 1979 by Jerry Brown during an earlier term as governor. “We enjoyed this real lush period when there was this boom in prison growth,” Ms. Brooks said. “There really isn’t any state-funded support for arts programs anymore.” The Actors’ Gang presumably has the fund-raising advantage of its association with Mr. Robbins and its following in Los Angeles, where it staged its own version of “Tartuffe” in the spring. But even it has struggled to raise money. During a break one scorching morning, Ms. Williams asked that this article note that the Actors’ Gang had received a $500 donation in makeup supplies from Mehron Makeup, an act of kindness, she said, that deserved notice.
us,“People don’t give money because they don’t see us,” she said. Advocates say these programs have reduced recidivism rates, though there is no conclusive research on that. But prison officials and inmates suggest that the workshops — by forcing inmates to confront emotions and to deal with other inmates they might ignore or fight with outside — can produce fundamental changes in behavior and character. “No. 1, it breaks down racial barriers,” said Ms. Peters, the former arts facilitator. “It breaks down gang barriers. It’s a safe place for them to come and get away from institutional stresses. And they tend to remain disciplinary-free: If you are busy writing a poem, you can’t be doing drugs.” Lt. Brian Davis, the public information officer at the Norco prison, who sat in on the sessions, said: “They build self-confidence. I see the inmates starting to work together, and somewhere along the line the fear goes away.” One inmate, Robert Paxton, 23, said the program “gives me a place to be silly — be myself.” “You know, this whole prison situation, where you have to act macho and put up these mental barriers, this really allowed like a mental vacation,” Mr. Paxton said. “It makes doing time that much more easier.” The workshops and rehearsals are antic and oddly entertaining: guards can be spotted peering through a window (even when Mr. Robbins is not on hand). The inmates are animated, campy, energized, liberated and fearlessly engaged, comfortable even playing women in this sea of gang tattoos and muscles.
us,And there is no attempt to pretend that this is not taking place where it is taking place. The real actors are issued panic buttons to attach to their belts, in case they are cornered. And Mr. Robbins draws heavily on the inmates’ lives in training them in the commedia dell’arte style that is the heart of the Actors’ Gang method, with its ornate costumes and makeup, exaggerated expressions and comedic movements, focusing on four basic emotional states: anger, fear, happiness and sadness. So it was that Mr. Robbins also asked the actors what made them angry. “This place turned me into a dope addict!” one shouted. Mr. Reiber followed with a cut-the-tension answer: “Prison food.” Mr. Robbins instructed the inmates to feel fear, again by connecting it to their own experiences. “What is Tartuffe afraid of?” he said, wearing a wool skullcap and dressed in black. “Being discovered. Because that would mean jail for him.” “Something is coming after you!” he said urgently to the inmates as they scampered around. “What is it?” “Cops!” one inmate yelled. “Cops!” Mr. Robbins responded, clapping his hands in delight. “Then run!” No one seemed more surprised at the experience than the inmates, as they said during the concluding sessions of two workshops conducted over the course of the past few months, one for the general prison population and one for a segregated population of former gang members and sex offenders. Prison officials asked that the last names of the segregated inmates not be used, saying that they could be put in danger.
us,“I know this,” said one of those inmates as he sat on the floor in a circle with Mr. Robbins, Ms. Williams and the other inmates. He and his fellow prisoners had just performed scenes from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” “I’m thinking about Shakespeare in the shower. I don’t think I ever did that before.”
sports/soccer,Atlanta Has Fan Clubs. Now It’s Going to Play Some M.L.S. Games, Too. - The New York Times ATLANTA — Terminus Legion, despite the finality of its name, came first. Long before Atlanta’s new Major League Soccer team had a date for its inaugural game, before it had an owner or a stadium or a youth academy or even a single player, the team had a supporters’ club. And then another. And another. Footie Mob offered fans the promise of a backbeat of Atlanta music, and sweet, smoky barbecue. The Faction was a blend of natives and transplants with a charity bent. Resurgence is for “grass-roots love of the game,” according to its website, though perhaps just for the adult set: Two of three chants listed on the site include a four-letter expletive. All the groups, though, have a common thread: They have wrapped their arms around the city’s new pro soccer team, Atlanta United F.C., which will play its first M.L.S. game on Sunday, at Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd Stadium, against the Red Bulls. (The team’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium is scheduled to open July 30.) Supporters’ groups, loosely organized or closely affiliated with teams, are a longstanding part of soccer, and they have long been the leading edge of fan culture in M.L.S. Philadelphia’s main fan group, Sons of Ben, predates the team it supports, traveling to matches involving other teams just to sit in the stands and chant about wanting one of its own. Many of the cities bidding to be part of the league’s next round of expansion already have fan clubs in place.
sports/soccer,Atlanta, though, has shown an unusual diversity of fan groups, as well as a surprising appetite for tickets. The organization has already set an M.L.S. expansion team record, with 30,000 season tickets sold. When Atlanta United turned up for its first official game during the preseason, an exhibition two hours north in Chattanooga, Tenn., it arrived with 8,000 fans in tow. When the team plays its first league game, it will do so in front of more than 50,000 fans — a near-capacity crowd. The city’s fan groups have each forged an identity and a following, and they may answer an important question: What does it mean to support a soccer team in the South — and specifically in Atlanta, the so-called capital of the South? J. R. Francis has been wrestling with the question since 2013. At the time, another prospective fan, Matt Stigall, was helping to lead a petition drive to bring an M.L.S. team to Atlanta. Francis and hundreds of others quickly signed on. The petitioners got the attention of Arthur Blank, the Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta Falcons owner, by sending his staff news of how boxes of papers with signatures were mounting. By the end of 2013, they had gathered about 4,000 names. One day, Francis said, they got a cryptic email from Blank’s organization. “It’s time to turn your petition drive into a supporters’ group,” the email said. Terminus Legion was born.
sports/soccer,The name, Francis noted, has roots in Atlanta’s history. Terminus was the city’s first name, in the early 19th century, when Atlanta was not so much a bustling Southern capital but merely the end of a rail route that started in Chattanooga. Four years after its founding, Terminus Legion continues to grow. At a midtown bar several weeks ago, an event called Terminalia drew dozens of fans with black, gold and red scarves, buzzing in anticipation of Atlanta United’s debut. Jorge E. Alonso, the group’s director of brand development, set up two laptops on a table to sign up new members amid the clamor. Michael Page stood nearby. As he took his wallet from the back pocket of his jeans to pay for a beer, a blue Chelsea F.C. supporter’s card fell to the floor. Page, 49, lived in London for a year three decades ago, an adventurous teenager tending bar at a pub only blocks from Chelsea’s stadium, Stamford Bridge. A geographer at Emory University, Page is a rarity in Atlanta: someone with family roots here that date back several generations. But he has followed Chelsea and England’s Premier League until now, finding it difficult to warm to M.L.S. because “I didn’t have a team where I’m from.”
sports/soccer,A few weeks after Terminalia, Mark Knipfer was nursing his 39-year-old ankles after he and other members of the Faction, another supporters’ group, beat members of Terminus Legion, 2-1, in the last 60 seconds of a Sunday game. The Faction, Knipfer said, is like its founders: half from somewhere else and half native to Georgia, or at least generally Southern. It is more of a family-oriented set, with a website that pledges an embrace of values like “using sport to help develop youth character.” The Faction raises money to support the Fugees Family, an Atlanta-area program that supports refugee children from 23 countries and that includes a school and soccer team. So far, the money comes from membership fees: $10 for adults, $5 for children. About 100 people have joined, Knipfer said. “We want to get to the point we’re recognized as a formidable force, maybe 1,000,” he said. Footie Mob will announce its presence in a different way, by seeking to imprint two Southern traditions onto M.L.S.: tailgating and barbecue. “To me, tailgating culture is perfect for the South,” said Curtis Jenkins, a founding member. Inside the stadium, Footie Mob members are planning chants based on the greats of Atlanta hip-hop, like Outkast, YoungBloodZ and Migos. There also will be nods to such Georgia bands as R.E.M. and the Allman Brothers. The goal, Jenkins said, is “if we were going to bring a blind man into the stadium, they should know they’re in Atlanta.”
sports/soccer,As for the relationship between all these groups? Knipfer said they were “together and separate, which is a fine line to walk.” The hope is that the groups’ common interest in Atlanta United will be able to overcome anything that might come between them. Alonso, for one, is proud to have led an effort inside Terminus Legion to ensure that its members leave one piece of Southern history outside the stadium gates. “I was the first one to say, ‘I see one rebel flag go up and I’m leaving Terminus,’” Alonso said. There have been other efforts to unify, too. Last summer, at ATL Soccer Con, an event to celebrate soccer in the city, Sam Veal of Resurgence took part in a panel discussion with members of three of the fan groups. For nearly an hour, they passed a microphone back and forth, weighing in on a variety of issues related to the team, the city and its nascent supporter culture. As the event wound to a close, Veal made one final plea. Be loud, he told the crowd. Be passionate. But please, he shouted, “don’t say, ‘You all.’” “For the love of God,” he thundered, “when you go to the match, say, ‘Y’all!’”
business,John Donovan of AT&T;, on Seeking Results Instead of Praise - The New York Times This interview with  John Donovan, chief technology officer at AT&T, was conducted and condensed by  Adam Bryant. Q. What were some early leadership lessons for you?  A. There are certain characteristics that give people a start — and for me, I remember starting to use them when I was named captain of my hockey team. I think after that it becomes practice. I think those characteristics are the ability to set a framework that makes sense to people, and being articulate. You can look at the landscape, characterize it and set a framework for action, then be able to articulate it clearly. You have to have antennas for picking out what’s really important. So you have to have those basic skills and be a good pattern recognizer. I was always good at those problems where you go “two, four, six, eight, what’s next?” And you start to put those skills together and then, like anything else, you get better with practice. That said, if there’s a situation where someone else needs to lead, and it’s working, that is A-O.K. I don’t feel a burning need to be in charge, and I don’t feel that it’s a bad thing to follow when the right things are getting done. So in some respects, I don’t have the innate drive that certain people have about control and ownership and leadership. When I left Silicon Valley, a lot of people bet me that I wouldn’t last at AT&T. They figured that because I’d been a C.E.O. before, I couldn’t go work at a big company where you have bosses, and you don’t control everything.
business,It really isn’t even a consideration for me. I just derive great satisfaction from a well-played plan. As a matter of fact, I have an aversion to situations where credit is showered upon leaders. Those don’t sit easily with me. Maybe that’s because I was one of 11 kids in our family. I love engaging, but I don’t like the compliments, with somebody saying, “Hey, great job.” Q. Other lessons? A. The first thing I noticed very quickly early on was that hard work is central to what you do, and that’s not any magic or science. I said, “Well, if I start today, and I outwork everybody, then the only question is the starting point.” So I figured that if I work really hard I can be in the top 5 percent in any field. It just gave me some comfort to say, O.K., I’m going to do fine financially, so I shouldn’t make decisions based on money. My objective should be to gain the broadest set of experiences I can, and just try to drill deep everywhere I can. And so I played the game for breadth. Early in my career, I bought businesses, fixed them and sold them. Some went well; some didn’t. I did some home development. I was in sales. I went back to business school. A lot of people work hard to get ahead, and I recognized early on that it’s a differentiator. I just figured that there was a certain amount of this that’s just raw tonnage.
business,Q. What else? A. I worked at Deloitte, and became a partner there. That’s probably where a lot of my development occurred as a leader. There were simple things around teams. I developed team skills because I started to engage in deliberate deflection of credit in an environment where it was all about credits. What I started realizing is that people appreciated when you played for the result, and not for your role on the team. So I learned there that giving credit away, deflecting credit, was an effective thing to do. I think I learned a lot of subtleties about teams and how you assemble teams. Q. Can you share some more insights on that? A. If you figure there’s a karma pool out there floating around for credits, you have to stop playing for credits. I remember the day I realized that, and that I probably never again needed to involve scorekeeping in anything that I did. Q. What are some questions you ask when you’re interviewing job candidates? A. I always ask questions about what words people would want on their tombstone. So I’ll ask, “If your professional colleagues were going to put three words on your tombstone — I mean literally three — what would those three words be?” And then the follow-up question is always the one that surprises people. I will then ask, “Instead of three, what’s the one word?”
business,I’ve tried to assemble teams with people who were grounded enough, and comfortable enough, to be able to have these kinds of conversations. When you find people who have that sort of grounding, then it can be about the problem you’re working to solve together, and not about the person. The leadership part for me now is so much more about game planning than about the role that I play in the game plan. I love the opportunity to take a role that I had and give it away to another team member, and the team result is as good or better. I sort of see myself over time as needing to play the game less, but I’m becoming better at getting even better results by that combination of the right framework and the right people in the right positions. Q. Back to your tombstone question. What’s the one word for you?  A. When I was young, the one word for me was “smart.” I wanted it to be “leadership.” I wanted it to be “inspirational.” But it was smart, and smart is an individual, lonely thing. When you get it on a tombstone, it feels like an island. I’d like to say that it’s “wise” today, but I don’t feel that I’ve accomplished that yet. Q. The other two words?
business,A. I do think they would be “inspirational,” and “leader.” I’m proud that I can inspire people. I think there are a lot of people I’ve worked with who have burned extra oil, but I don’t think at the end of the day that inspiration is measured in terms of me getting more from them. I think it’s about a better result that we can all share in. Q. How did you make the transition to a big company like AT&T? A. So when I came to AT&T, I was standing on the shoulders of giants in the industry. I was going in to lead a group that, frankly, I wouldn’t have been qualified enough to join as a junior person. But let me start with the process I went through. I went to my direct reports and I said I want the 16 smartest people in the technology organization. It’s not about titles. I don’t want any diplomats. I don’t want any process people. And I called them the Tech Council. I still have it today, almost four years later. I rotate people in and out. I gave them several hours a month. Rules of the road are that you’re not allowed to report back to anybody you work for — what is said in this room stays in this room.
business,We then started with a list of all the things that were broken, stupid, idiotic, what’s killing innovation, from 16 really bright people who were willing and able to tell you the truth. And if you look at some of the things that we’ve done in our innovation program, a lot of the seeds were born in that room. And so we built a profile that started with the ugly truth, and that’s kind of where we had to start from. When I came in, I was led to believe that we would have an innovation problem. And I learned very quickly that we did have an innovation problem, but we didn’t have an invention problem — and that’s important. Q. Can you elaborate? A. If you’re going to build a car and you have no blueprint, and you have no factory, that’s a different place to start than if you go in your garage and you turn the lights on and there’s everything that you need to build a Ferrari. It just isn’t assembled. That’s a very different world. So I very quickly started to tell people that we’re close. We have inventions. Most companies don’t have that. So I realized that this was going to be much simpler than I originally thought walking in. You have all these brilliant people inventing. So I started just by telling folks that’s an important distinction. We have invention. Q. Parse the distinction for me a bit more.
business,A. I would describe innovation as invention with a customer at the other end. When it becomes a relationship that’s consummated with a commercial transaction, then that’s an innovation. That adoption part of it was where we were not good. But the invention was there. So I did a diagnosis. The 16 folks who were with me gave me a million reasons to explain why we couldn’t innovate, it’s just simply impossible. So then we spent hours and hours just breaking the problem down. Then we said, let’s start an innovation program in this room. And we started our “crowdsourcing” plan in that room. Q. Tell me more about that.  A. It starts with the fact that we’re too kind of an organization, so no one stands up and says, “Your ideas are lousy.” So we have this culture of really nice people, and it’s nurturing. And there’s a convenient place to blame if I don’t want to tell you your idea isn’t any good — I just blame it on the people upstairs, and I say that they don’t like it. So I said, let’s start with some tabletop exercises. Each of us brought six ideas into the room. So we had 96 ideas. Everybody presents their ideas, and then we voted on them, and chose the top two that were going to get funded. And then we knocked down every hurdle to get those two ideas into their final form and into a funding process.
business,Today, that idea has been expanded to an online site, with 104,000 people who are on the innovation pipeline, as we call it. It generates thousands of ideas. Then people vote on them, like in social media — thumbs-up, thumbs-down — and it’s invisible who voted. Why? Because, culturally, people don’t want to call other people out. So then you move to the collaboration phase, where you need comments, and comments are not without attribution. We thought about it, and decided that you have to be accountable when you use words. And so it doesn’t feel like a big company anymore. Somebody might say that an idea is impractical because it would be really expensive, but then someone says, wait a minute, what about trying this? So the group comes together and they solve the problem. What happens in that second phase is that you earn a certain amount of currency, fake currency, for playing the game. If you vote up and vote down, and you’re pretty good — meaning that your down votes are on stuff that went down, and your up votes are on stuff that went up — you can earn more. Then you earn points for being a good collaborator.
business,Then, at the end of every quarter, people “invest” in these ideas, and there’s a stock value that’s placed on them. They’re placed on the potential leader board. And then on the leader board, people invest in them and the ideas get voted up to the top. The top 10 move on to the next phase for potential funding. People then pitch the ideas to an angel committee — we only give them 20 minutes — and then on the spot we decide to fund it or not. But this time it’s real money. So we’ve had more than 15,000 ideas generated. We have 45 of them we funded, with tens of millions of dollars that have been invested. Products are now hitting the marketplace. It’s become so popular that executives are throwing problems out to the crowd, like instead of spending $1 million with a professional branding firm, they’ll offer a trip for two to Hawaii to the person who comes up with the best idea. If you look at this process, it’s designed around the idea of venture capital, because I had the experience coming out of that world on how things get funded. It also uses social media to solve this perceived problem that there’s some corporate machinery that kills ideas. Now it’s your peers, and good ideas ultimately get funded with real money.
business,At the end of every quarter there are prizes — real money — for the people who have made the most contributions. You get a bonus for this, and you get a bonus for that. We already have about 50 patents that have come out of it. It’s an amazing environment, and it was built by those 16 people in that room. It started as a paper exercise, and all we did is we digitally removed real cultural barriers by thinking through how we can use technology to solve that problem.
sports/soccer,M.L.S. Preview: Three Stories to Watch - The New York Times
upshot,Heavier Babies Do Better in School - The New York Times Like so many other parts of health care, childbirth has become a more medically intense experience over the last two decades. The use of drugs to induce labor has become far more common, as have cesarean sections. Today, about half of all births in this country are hastened either by drugs or surgery, double the share in 1990. Crucial to the change has been a widely held belief that once fetuses pass a certain set of thresholds — often 39 weeks of gestation and five and a half pounds in weight — they’re as healthy as they can get. More time in the womb doesn’t do them much good, according to this thinking. For parents and doctors, meanwhile, scheduling a birth, rather than waiting for its random arrival, is clearly more convenient. But a huge new set of data, based on every child born in Florida over an 11-year span, is calling into question some of the most basic assumptions of our medicalized approach to childbirth. The results also play into a larger issue: the growing sense among many doctors and other experts that Americans would actually be healthier if our health care system were sometimes less aggressive.
upshot,The new data suggest that the thresholds to maximize a child’s health seem to be higher, which means that many fetuses might benefit by staying longer in the womb, where they typically add at least a quarter-pound per week. Seven-pound babies appear to be healthier than six-pound babies — and to fare better in school as they age. The same goes for eight-pound babies compared with seven-pound babies, and nine-pound babies compared with eight-pound babies. Weight, of course, may partly be an indicator of broader fetal health, but it seems to be a meaningful one: The chunkier the baby, the better it does on average, all the way up to almost 10 pounds. “Birth weight matters, and it matters for everyone,” says David N. Figlio, a Northwestern University professor and co-author of the study, which will soon be published in the American Economic Review, one of the field’s top journals. Mr. Figlio — 5 pounds, 15 ounces at birth — is quick to add that birth weight is not destiny. Its effects are considerably smaller than those of social class, for example. A lighter baby of well-educated parents is likely to do much better in life than a heavier baby of high-school dropouts. Yet within every group the researchers studied, birth weight appeared to have a noticeable effect, even after controlling for a long list of other factors. Mr. Figlio estimates that, all else equal, a 10-pound baby will score an average of 80 points higher on the 1,600-point SAT than a six-pound baby. Another way to see the pattern is to look only at top-scoring students: Among the top 5 percent of test scorers in elementary school, one in three weighed at least eight pounds at birth, compared with only one in four of all babies.
upshot,The Florida study will not be the last word on birth weight and timing. As the authors acknowledge, they cannot rule out the possibility that weight is a proxy for other aspects of fetal health that more time in the womb would not improve. And late and heavy babies also bring some risks. Still, the results are sufficiently striking — across a very large population, and present in every subgroup — that they’re likely to influence the debate about the medicalization of birth. In 2011, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups began pushing to eliminate induced labor before the 39th week of pregnancy absent a clear medical reason. The induction rate has since fallen. If further research confirms the Florida findings, it will be easy to see an argument for further declines, as well as for a serious look at whether the induction rate is also too high in the 40th week. Many inductions today are elective, rather than coming after a woman’s water has broken or after a medical problem. The notion that fetuses may benefit from being in the womb beyond the 39th week, says Dr. Brent C. James, who runs the Institute for Health Care Delivery Research in Salt Lake City, “makes perfect clinical sense.” As in much of biology, he added, “You don’t have a hard cutoff, a cliff edge.”
upshot,These issues are part of a debate that extends well beyond childbirth. The notion that Mother Nature should more often trump Pitocin and other induction drugs fits with a broad questioning of the American health care system, famously the world’s most intensive and expensive. Starting about a decade ago, an inchoate group of reformers — doctors, nurses, hospital executives, social scientists and others — began pushing the idea that there was a better way. Yes, intensive medicine can bring lifesaving benefits, but technologically advanced treatments often don’t work any better than more basic forms. In particular, treatments that work wonders on a small group of patients often spread to a much wider group of people, including many who don’t benefit from them. Induced labor, which does indeed help women and babies facing health risks, is one example. Others include cardiac stents, back surgery and prostate treatment. Armed with reams of evidence, the reformers began pushing hospitals and insurers, including Medicare, to change. In the private market, among other things, insurers have excluded some high-cost doctors from their networks. For all the problems and waste that still exist, the effort has had an effect: Health costs have slowed sharply in the last several years, surprising nearly every expert. Remarkably, per-person spending in Medicare is on a pace to be about 6 percent lower this year than it was three years ago.
upshot,It’s impossible to know whether the trend will last. But Obamacare, while not the main reason for the slowdown, may be sustaining it. Even as the law has added people to the health-insurance rolls, which increases costs, it has also targeted unnecessary, expensive care. Whether the slowdown will continue is among today’s biggest economic questions. Yet the economic implications aren’t even the most important ones. The health implications are. The idea that we can be healthier with less health care is no longer just wishful thinking; it’s a serious theory, with growing evidence. Childbirth makes for a crucial case study. It affects everyone, and for centuries was among the biggest dangers women confronted. The maternal death rate per childbirth long approached  1.5 percent, historians estimate. So the notion that modern medicine should be removed from childbirth altogether is clearly wrong. In the United States today, the death rate for mothers in childbirth is less than 0.02 percent. Modern medicine saves the lives of millions of childbearing women — and their infants — every year. Yet as with stents, back surgery and prostate treatments, many believe the medicalization of childbirth almost certainly went too far. “Too much intervention is not a good thing,” said Dr. Barbara S. Levy, vice president for health policy at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Researchers now agree that nonmedical inductions before 39 weeks are a problem. The next question is whether fetuses continue to get substantial benefits from being in the womb — without much additional risk, for mother or baby — after 39 weeks.
upshot,It’s a question that affects a lot of births. In 2012, 30 percent of births came between 39 and 40 weeks, 20 percent came between 40 and 41 weeks and 14 percent came after 41 weeks. Florida offers a window on the issue because the state tracks children from birth through college. (Historically, most databases that follow individuals over time have been small.) The authors of the new study — Mr. Figlio; Jonathan Guryan and Krzysztof Karbownik, also of Northwestern; and Jeffrey Roth, of the University of Florida College of Medicine — used the data to compare birth weight with test scores from third through eighth grades, as well as with kindergarten readiness scores. They controlled for, among other factors, the health and sex of the baby, the length of the pregnancy and the health, age, race and education of the mother. To test their results, the researchers also looked at twins. Twins are a frequent subject of research, because they share many unobservable environmental conditions. And the effect of birth weight on twins was similar to its effect on single babies. Importantly, the effect was also very similar for same-sex twins (who can be identical twins, with the same genes) and different-sex twins (who cannot be identical). That similarity suggests that birth weight was not merely a proxy for hidden genetic factors — or hidden fetal conditions — that would remain unaffected by an extra pound or two.
upshot,The relationship between birth weight and test scores was present by the time children enrolled in kindergarten and remained fairly constant throughout elementary and middle school. Other research has found that children who do better in elementary school are more likely to graduate from college, earn more as adults and live longer. This pattern would fit with the so-called Barker hypothesis. It is the once controversial theory proposed by the late British epidemiologist Dr. David Barker — now largely accepted — that conditions in the womb and infancy cast a lifelong shadow. Many forms of cancer and heart disease, among other conditions, have roots in the earliest stages of life, Dr. Barker argued. The authors of the new paper are continuing to study Florida children and say other researchers should try to confirm or cast doubt on the findings. Without more research, many doctors may be skeptical of changing their habits. Dr. Wendy M. White of the Mayo Clinic said that she would want to make sure that often unobserved health problems, including those unconnected to genes or fetal conditions, weren’t causing both lower birth weights and cognitive gaps. Whatever the uncertainty, the prevalence of the effects across so many groups, in one of the nation’s largest, most diverse states, offers reason to take the results seriously. Some of the implications seem straightforward. Other studies, for example, have found that anti-poverty programs, like food stamps, can increase the weight of babies born to poor mothers. By extension, those programs, which are often derided as wasteful, may have very large health, education and economic benefits.
upshot,The issue of how to time births is thornier. If the results hold up, we are probably inducing too many babies too soon. On the other hand, there are some risks for babies, and pain for mothers, with longer pregnancies, especially beyond 41 weeks. “There are two patients here, and you want to optimize the outcome for both,” as Dr. Levy says. It is conceivable that fewer inductions could bring better overall results while also making some rare newborn complications slightly more common. The trade-offs are sometimes unavoidable. But acknowledging and grappling with those trade-offs would still represent a significant shift. For a long time, we have fooled ourselves into thinking that more health care meant better health. The truth may actually be more reassuring.
sports/football,Quarterback Alex Smith Provides Chiefs With Grit in a Seven-Game Tear - The New York Times KANSAS CITY, Mo. —  Alex Smith strode through the Kansas City Chiefs’ locker room Sunday afternoon wearing white game pants soaked through with rainwater, splotched with mud and tinted green from the paint used to make a football field look nice in December. After starting the season by dropping five of six games, including three losses decided by a touchdown or less, the Chiefs (8-5) have won seven in a row, holding off San Diego, 10-3, on Sunday largely on a goal-line stand by a Kansas City defense tattered by injuries. But Smith helped the Chiefs win the unglamorous game with his legs, his spirit and his poise, as he has throughout the winning streak that put Kansas City in an A.F.C. wild-card spot. Smith, 31, the former No. 1 overall draft choice who was traded to Kansas City in 2013 after seven generally disappointing seasons in San Francisco, completed 15 of 23 passes for only 191 yards Sunday. He threw his first interception after 312 passes, the second-longest streak in N.F.L. history. “Obviously, the streak is over, so I don’t have to answer those questions anymore,” he said, smiling. But his pants were a mess because he picked up 40 yards rushing on five carries — including an 18-yard scramble, ending with a gutsy dart up the middle — that enabled the Chiefs to kick a field goal at the end of the first half.
sports/football,“I’m dropping back to throw the football, and sometimes those things just happen,” Smith said. Through 13 games, Smith is second on the Chiefs in rushing with 366 yards. He has been an enormous asset for a team that was largely thought to be all but done when Jamaal Charles sustained a season-ending knee injury in a glum 18-17 loss at home to the Chicago Bears in Week 5. “That’s Alex — still a scooter,” Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce said. “He ran that spread offense in college and hasn’t lost a step yet.” Smith, who rushed for 1,416 yards in nine previous N.F.L. seasons, has run for 247 yards and two touchdowns in the winning streak. He picked up 12 yards on one run Sunday, enhanced by a 15-yard penalty when Chargers safety Jahleel Addae drilled him after he went out of bounds. After he slid across the slippery tarp in front of the Chargers’ bench, Smith got up and screamed at Addae, who was fined after a helmet-to-helmet hit on Jeremy Maclin in the Chiefs’ 33-3 victory Nov. 22 in San Diego. Smith said after the game that the Chargers were “trying to headhunt,” but he later backed away, saying it was a division game and Addae was a physical player. “It’s meant to be heated,” Smith said. “It’s what football is about.” He said he was simply trying to get his teammates fired up — “and get me going,” he added, smiling — after the penalty on Addae. But Smith apparently had already inspired his team.
sports/football,“You can obviously rely on Alex; he’s a great weapon,” Kansas City right tackle Jah Reid said. “He gives us another leg up. He just has incredible poise in the pocket and makes excellent reads. He knows just when to pull down the ball and run with it.” With 3,034 yards passing this season, only four interceptions and a 95.8 quarterback rating, Smith knows by now when to throw the ball, too. The second-year receiver Albert Wilson said he liked to “pick his head” with questions about coverages. “He takes care of the ball, for one,” Wilson said. “He can speed a game up and slow a game down.” On the drive before his 18-yard scramble, Smith threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Wilson on a second-down play. Smith sensed that the Chargers would bring a heavy pass rush — and they did just that. So Smith threw a pass across the middle to Wilson, who broke a tackle by San Diego safety Eric Weddle and scored what would be the game’s only touchdown. “Good check by Alex,” Weddle said. “We should have checked out of it, but, shoot, they made the play.” Kansas City Coach Andy Reid pointed out that Smith “showed a lot of fire” on the touchdown pass to Wilson. “Then he came back with the run,” Reid said. “His legs have helped us. I know he’s getting up there a little bit, but he knows how to protect himself when he goes down, which is important. And he can still run.”
sports/football,The Chiefs made enough plays Sunday to win again. “Good thing it’s not a beauty pageant,” safety Eric Berry said after the game. Reid said: “If you’re going to be a good football team, you’ve got to win games like this. We’ve found ways to lose games just like this.”
us,Shots Are Fired as Anniversary Is Marked in Ferguson - The New York Times FERGUSON, Mo. —  A day of peaceful protest commemorating the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, by a white police officer one year ago ended in gunfire late Sunday as multiple shots rang out on West Florissant Avenue, the commercial district hit by rioting last summer. A St. Louis County police officer was involved in the shooting, which occurred at about 11:15 p.m., after coming under heavy gunfire, the department said in a post on Twitter. Another department post said, “At least 2 unmarked cars took shots.” About 100 people who had been milling about in the street scattered, seeking cover behind cars. Police officers sought protection behind their riot shields and drew their weapons. The streets cleared as an eerie silence took hold, the only sound coming from a helicopter overhead. There was no immediate word from the police on injuries. The event during the day drew a range of political leaders, national activists and ordinary people who said they felt a connection to the events of a year ago. With the writer and academic Cornel West behind them, Mr. Brown’s family stood over the freshly repaved patch of Canfield Drive where Mr. Brown died. Relatives of Eric Garner and Oscar Grant, two other black men who died in confrontations with the police in Staten Island and in Oakland, Calif., also attended.
us,Assembled around a makeshift memorial of colorful stuffed animals, several activists urged the crowd not to let Mr. Brown’s death be in vain. They held a four-and-a-half-minute moment of silence — symbolic of the four and a half hours that Mr. Brown’s body was left in the street after the shooting — and then marched a mile and a half through the muggy air to a local church for a service. “They didn’t give us no justice, so they ain’t going to get no peace,” Bud Cuzz, the leader of an activist group, Lost Voices, told the crowd on Canfield Drive to boisterous cheers. Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Mr. Brown and has since resigned from the Ferguson police force, was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by a local grand jury in November. And while a Justice Department investigation concluded that the city unconstitutionally targeted black people for an array of fees and fines largely intended to raise revenue, it also concluded that the shooting did not warrant criminal charges. But people here spoke of the need to overhaul the system, calling for an end to racism and what they see as the unfair treatment of blacks by the police. They invoked the names of other blacks killed by the police. They demanded that national politicians address the grievances of blacks. They called for a national day of resistance on Monday through acts of civil disobedience.
us,“Every city, I want us to close it down!” Anthony Shahid, a local activist, screamed into a microphone before leading the crowd in a chant, “If we can’t get it, shut it down.” Throughout the weekend, protesters and activists held rallies and vigils remembering Mr. Brown and others who were killed by the police or who died in custody in cities around the world. In New York, protesters gathered on Sunday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and at a government building in Harlem before a planned vigil in Manhattan’s Union Square. Two people were arrested during a demonstration that blocked traffic near Brooklyn’s Fulton Mall. In Ypsilanti, Mich., demonstrators gathered at a library park for a rally demanding an end to racial injustice. Similar demonstrations took place in Pittsburgh and at Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass. Others were planned for Denver; at the Washington State Capitol in Olympia; at the Waller County Jail in Hempstead, Tex., where Sandra Bland was found dead; and in St. Petersburg, Fla. In London, demonstrators picketed outside the American Embassy. More demonstrations were planned for Monday in St. Louis and in Philadelphia, where organizers have adopted the hashtag #MoralMonday on social media. Although things remained peaceful during the day on Sunday, a tension pulsed through the air. Mr. Brown’s killing set off weeks of unrest that included arson fires and looting, and the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. As police officers escorted marchers through the streets on Sunday, they seemed determined to appear welcoming. At one point, law enforcement officials asked the marchers to hold up after gunshots rang out a few blocks away in a nonfatal shooting unrelated to the march.
us,“This is all good right now,” Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police Department said as the marchers paused while officers tried to make sure it was safe for them to continue. But after one of his department’s police cars came racing out of a side street, siren blaring, and turned in the direction of the demonstrators, Chief Belmar became irked. He mumbled an obscenity, looked at some of his officers standing on the side of the road in the distance and twirled his finger in the air, saying, “Turn him around.” The situation was quickly cleared and the march resumed to the church. The chief said he had himself been reflecting on the day of Mr. Brown’s shooting as he stood on Canfield Drive. “I’d been a policeman over 28 years when that happened, and I tell people all the time, ‘You think you have all the answers and you think you’re experienced and have seen everything; well, you haven’t,’ ” he said. “Last year’s events serve as a reminder that just about the time you think that you really have a depth of understanding of anything that can happen, you don’t.” The city of Ferguson, which is about two-thirds black, has taken some steps to address concerns about policies that the Justice Department described as discriminatory. It has hired a black interim city manager and a black interim police chief. It has released city officials who were discovered to have sent racist emails. It has hired a new municipal judge.
us,On the state level, the Legislature passed a law capping the amount of revenue that cities can collect from traffic tickets, responding to accusations that municipalities were targeting mostly black motorists with unfair fines and fees. Still, the people gathered here on Sunday said they wanted to see more done. Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, applauded the activists who climbed on stage with the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and demanded an opportunity to talk about police killings during an event in Seattle on Saturday. Mr. Sanders left the event without addressing the crowd. “We got to hold our elected officials accountable,” Ms. Garner said. “If he’s not going to talk about our issues, he shouldn’t talk at all.” Belden Lane, a 72-year-old white man, held a sign that read, “These are my sons, too ... dying in the streets.” “I don’t have to worry about that because my kids are white,” Mr. Lane said. “So I’m here to witness to what needs to be changed. It’s not just black men dying in the streets, but it’s white people losing beloved black men dying in the streets and our need to stand together and say, ‘No.’ ” At one point during the march, Mr. Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., said, “This moment was sponsored by Darren Wilson.” The march ended at Greater St. Mark Family Church, where rap music blared outside before a service that was part somber, part strategy, part fiery.
us,The Rev. Tommie Pierson, the pastor at Greater St. Mark and a state representative, encouraged people to seek change through the political process. “If we’re going to change the system to work for us, we need to run for office and vote for ourselves,” Mr. Pierson said. “Protesting is good, but it only brings attention to the problems. Solving the problem requires doing other things.”

He was up in the center field seats at Minute Maid Park, rooting for his favorite team, the Houston Astros, to advance to the World Series. With one out to go, Albert Pujols launched a ball into orbit for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Astros, and Goldschmidt, had to hold off their celebration. “I had a good view,” Goldschmidt said last week before a game at Nationals Park. “It was crazy. I was like every fan there. I was upset. But being in it, you know it’s just part of the game. You’re going to win some and lose some.” Goldschmidt’s nonchalance belies an inner drive that has made him, for the first half of this season, Pujols’s heir as the most productive first baseman in the National League and a leading contender for the Most Valuable Player award. Goldschmidt is hitting .306 with 19 homers and a league-best 67 runs batted in for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who lead the N.L. West and visit Citi Field this week for four games against the Mets. “We’re just kind of jumping on his back, and thankfully he’s got big, broad shoulders,” reliever Brad Ziegler said. “He can carry us.”
sports/baseball,Goldschmidt, 25, is not quite Pujols in his prime, but his back story is similar. Both were taken deep in the draft, dismissed as big-bodied and one-dimensional, yet needed only one full season in the minors to prove the industry wrong. The difference is that Pujols was fueled by the notion of silencing his critics. Goldschmidt seems unmoved by slights. Kyle Drabek, a high school teammate of Goldschmidt’s, was chosen in the first round of the draft after their senior year. Goldschmidt was not drafted until the 49th round, by the Los Angeles Dodgers, but there were no hard feelings; he was in Drabek’s wedding, and Drabek will be in his. Major college programs ignored Goldschmidt, but that was O.K., too. “It didn’t bother Paul,” said Trip Couch, the scout who later signed him for the Diamondbacks. “He was happy as can be to go to Texas State.” Goldschmidt did not start until his junior year of high school, but Couch had kept close track of him. In college, Couch said, he asked a coach in the prestigious Cape Cod League to give Goldschmidt a roster spot. The coach passed, but again Goldschmidt shrugged it off. He found a spot in an Alaskan league and was grateful to have it. The Diamondbacks loved Goldschmidt’s character and were intrigued by his opposite-field power, but even they had their doubts. They drafted five corner infielders in 2009 before taking Goldschmidt, who bats right-handed, in the eighth round with the 246th overall pick. He signed for $95,000.
sports/baseball,“I thought eighth round was pretty good,” Goldschmidt said. “Everyone has doubters; even the best guys in this game have doubters if they have a bad game, a bad month or whatever. You can’t let outside influences affect your mood. I just try to play the best I can every day, get better and try to help the team.” To those who know Goldschmidt, the desire to get better defines him. His rookie-league hitting coach, Alan Zinter, had been a first-round pick of the Mets in 1989 and toiled for 13 years before his first call to the majors. Zinter, who now works for the Cleveland Indians, tells young players there are no guarantees and to take nothing for granted. In Goldschmidt, he found a like-minded pupil who specialized in direct questions. To the hitting coach, he would ask: How do I become a consistent major league hitter? To the infield coach: How do I become a Gold Glove first baseman? To the strength coach: How do I change my body to get in the best shape possible? Zinter said he trusted the coaches implicitly. “A lot of kids have so much pride that they want to show the coaches and the front office that they know what they’re doing, and they don’t need the help,” Zinter said. “They don’t absorb the information because they want us to think they know it already. Goldy didn’t have an ego. He didn’t have that illusion of knowledge. He’s O.K. with wanting to learn.”
sports/baseball,With success on the field came more refined questions, about handling failure, dealing with umpires, anything to give him an edge. Goldschmidt still struck out a lot — 161 times at Class A in 2010 — and he never made Baseball America’s list of the top 10 Diamondbacks prospects. But his coaches could not shake the notion that Goldschmidt, more than most, would give himself every chance to maximize his talent. “Anybody could see the raw power,” said the Arizona coach Turner Ward, who managed Goldschmidt at Class AA Mobile in 2011. “But what other people couldn’t see was his work ethic and his desire to be the best at everything he does, from a defensive standpoint, base running; he’s not the fastest guy, but he’s a very good base runner and base stealer. He wants to be as well-rounded a player as he can be.” Goldschmidt was hitting .303 for Mobile, with 30 home runs and 9 stolen bases, when Ward called him at home late one morning. Goldschmidt was eating breakfast and figured Ward was summoning the team to the field for early hitting. In fact, he was calling him up to the Diamondbacks, who were playing the first-place Giants in San Francisco. “He was like, ‘Are you serious, or are you joking around with me?’ ” Ward said. “I mean, how could this guy not know there’s a chance, putting up those numbers?”
sports/baseball,Goldschmidt held his own with the Diamondbacks, hitting .250 with eight home runs as they overtook the Giants to win the West. He hit .438 in a division series loss to Milwaukee, and he impressed teammates with a disciplined pregame routine and the same inquisitive nature that had helped him through the minors. “He’s done such a great job of listening to everything and channeling how it works for him,” said Aaron Hill, a veteran second baseman. “He asks guys everything — about ground balls, footwork, counts, swings, setups, where to sit in the box, what I’m doing. You name it, he’s asking the questions.” Hill continued: “It’s good for young guys to talk baseball, because sometimes you don’t see that a lot when they’re coming up. They like the lifestyle; they like the big leagues. This guy came up and he’s baseball, baseball, baseball. He’s going to be a great role model.” To the Diamondbacks’ manager, Kirk Gibson, Goldschmidt already is. Gibson praised Goldschmidt for synthesizing scouting reports and advice from coaches, finding the essentials and not being confused. He will stray from his comfort zone, Gibson added, if he thinks it will make him better. The Diamondbacks confounded some of their peers last winter by trading Justin Upton, Chris Young and Trevor Bauer, supposedly to create a scrappy culture by sacrificing high-end stars. Missing from the narrative was Goldschmidt, who has ground out a place among the game’s elite, setting an example in the process.
sports/baseball,“They see the way he works, and it’s relentless, and it’s on schedule, and it’s every day — and they follow,” Gibson said. “He does it with enthusiasm; they all do it with enthusiasm. It’s what he wants to do.” Teammates have made T-shirts calling Goldschmidt “America’s First Baseman” and used their Twitter accounts to promote him for the All-Star Game. Goldschmidt swears he has not even thought about it — he has profound respect for Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds, who leads N.L. first basemen in votes — but Gibson has. Gibson said he told the Giants’ Bruce Bochy, who will manage the N.L. All-Stars, to make sure to put Goldschmidt on the roster. It was a request as much for Bochy, Gibson’s friend, as for Goldschmidt. “You want to manage this guy,” Gibson said he told Bochy, “because he’s everything you could want.”

world/europe,Thousands of Men to Be Pardoned for Gay Sex, Once a Crime in Britain - The New York Times LONDON — The men were convicted — tens of thousands of them — of crimes like buggery, gross indecency and loitering with intent. They had been arrested in bars, coffee houses and public bathrooms, and sometimes in the privacy of their homes and with their partners. In many cases, their only offense was seeking intimacy with another man. Decades after homosexuality was decriminalized in Britain, the government announced on Thursday that it would posthumously pardon thousands of gay and bisexual men who were convicted, in essence, of having or seeking gay sex. Since 2012, men with such convictions who are still alive have been able to apply to have their names cleared. The law providing for the pardons, which could take effect in a matter of months now that it has the support of the Conservative government, is named for Alan Turing, the mathematician who made a major contribution to Britain in World War II by cracking Germany’s Enigma coding machine and was a central figure in the development of the computer. Turing was convicted on charges of homosexuality in 1952 and committed suicide in 1954. The government apologized in 2009 for its treatment of him, and in 2013, Queen Elizabeth II formally pardoned him. In April, the head of Britain’s signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, also apologized, for its past discrimination against gays.
world/europe,While Britain, like many countries, has experienced a sharp turnabout in its attitudes toward homosexuality — same-sex marriage has been legal since 2014 — the announcement did not meet with uniform enthusiasm. Stonewall, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, said it did not go far enough because it still requires a case-by-case review of pardon applications by living men. Others said they wanted an apology, not a pardon. “I was not guilty of anything,” George Montague, 93, a gay activist and author who lives in Brighton, England and was convicted in the 1970s of gross indecency, told the BBC program “Newsnight.” “I was only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. My name was on the ‘queer list,’ which the police had in those days. And I will not accept a pardon.” Mr. Montague described Turing as a hero, but said he opposed the posthumous pardon. “What was he guilty of?” Mr. Montague asked. “He was guilty of the same as what they call me guilty of: being born only able to fall in love with another man.” Consensual sex between men over age 21 was decriminalized in England and Wales in 1967, in Scotland in 1980 and in Northern Ireland in 1982. The age of consent for homosexual sex was lowered to 16, the same as for heterosexual sex, in 2001. (Lesbian sex was not specifically outlawed in Britain, although lesbians were occasionally prosecuted under vice statutes. The pardon applies only to men.)
world/europe,The Turing Law was put forward by John Sharkey, a member of the House of Lords who championed the pardon for Turing. He estimated that 15,000 of 65,000 men convicted under laws that criminalized gay sex were still alive. Among the deceased who might be eligible for a pardon is Oscar Wilde, the Irish playwright who was convicted and sentenced to two years of hard labor in 1895 after being accused of sodomy, although the complexity of his case makes it difficult to know for sure. He was tried not once but twice, and only after he withdraw a criminal libel lawsuit against his accuser. Since October 2012, men who were convicted of sexual offenses that are no longer illegal have been able to apply to the Home Office to have those crimes expunged under what is known as the “disregard process.” So far, 335 applications have been received, and 84 granted. Under the plan announced Thursday, those men also will receive an automatic pardon. “It is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offenses who would be innocent of any crime today,” Sam Gyimah, the parliamentary under secretary of state for prisons and probation, said in a statement. Under the Turing Law, the pardons would apply only to offenses that are no longer crimes. Men who had sex with someone who did not give consent, or who was not 16 or older at the time, will not be eligible for a pardon, nor would men whose crime would now “constitute the offense of sexual activity in a public lavatory,” which is still a crime.
world/europe,The last provision could be a significant obstacle to a pardon for many men, given that as recently as the 1970s, public bathrooms were often a destination for men seeking same-sex intimacy. John Nicolson, a member of Parliament from Scotland, has put forward a bill that would offer an automatic blanket pardon to men convicted of having gay sex. That bill, which Parliament is scheduled to debate on Friday, has support from Stonewall, the advocacy group, but appears likely to be blocked by the Conservative majority in the House of Commons. Mr. Gyimah said the Nicolson proposal was too broad. “A blanket pardon, without the detailed investigations carried out by the Home Office under the disregard process, could see people guilty of an offense which is still a crime today claiming to be pardoned,” he said. “This would cause an extraordinary and unnecessary amount of distress to victims.” Matt Houlbrook, a professor of cultural history at the University of Birmingham and the author of “Queer London: Perils and Pleasures in the Sexual Metropolis, 1918-1957,” said he was worried that the pardons might help oversimplify both gay history and the identities of men like Turing. His book describes urban gay life in the early 20th century as more vibrant and open than is commonly understood, and as a world in which sexual behavior and sexual identity were not yet fused. “The most remarkable thing about queer urban culture is that it was, to a large extent, composed of and created by men who never thought themselves queer,” Mr. Houlbrook wrote.
world/europe,In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Houlbrook said the government’s announcement could have “symbolic and practical importance” for men still seeking to clear their names, but he argued that the pardons were somewhat beside the point. “A retrospective pardon doesn’t do much to atone for the realities of what it was like to be arrested and prosecuted at the time,” he said. George Chauncey, a history professor at Yale, said he was not aware of any similar blanket pardon being offered in the United States for sodomy, degenerate disorderly conduct or other charges commonly used against men caught trying to pick up other men. The closest, he said, is the Obama administration’s policy, since 2011, of allowing military veterans who were discharged for homosexuality to apply to have their discharges reclassified as “honorable” rather than “undesirable.” But those decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.
health,Changes Coming for Health Care in China and Cuba - The New York Times Two countries that are models of effective public health intervention, China and Cuba, have recently embarked on important policy changes, leaving some experts wondering whether citizens will be left worse off. In September, Cuba and the Obama administration began moving closer to normalized relations, which may expose Cuba’s vaunted medical system to powerful new market pressures. In October, China renounced its one-child policy, under which most families were forbidden to have more than a single child. Both countries enshrine health care as a fundamental right. Cuba is a well-known anomaly: so poor that it is barely able to feed its people, yet able to equal or beat the United States in two important health indicators — life expectancy and child mortality. The nation has 30,000 family doctors and 500 local clinics, and every Cuban sees a doctor at least once a year. Former Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a doctor, visited last year and praised aspects of Cuba’s primary care system, saying it “harkens back to the days of family physicians making house calls armed only with their deep personal patient knowledge and their stethoscope.” In the last decade, Cuba has sent thousands of doctors on overseas aid missions. They have treated 3.5 million patients. During last year’s Ebola outbreak in West Africa, one American-built hospital was staffed by Cubans.
health,China, too, has made enormous strides. As the nation turned itself into the world’s factory town, the megacities intended to house millions of workers were built with water and sewer pipes, screened windows, air-conditioning and nearby hospitals — amenities mostly missing in the farm villages the workers came from. Clean water reduces deaths from cholera, dysentery and a dozen other intestinal pathogens. Stopping mosquitoes and flies reduces deaths and disability from malaria, yellow fever, trachoma, leishmaniasis and more. Whenever epidemiologists talk about how much the world has improved in the last 20 years — millions fewer children dying, being stunted by worm disease or living without running water — they usually have to add: “Of course, most of that progress was in China.” Chinese researchers now routinely publish work in top medical journals. In 2003, China crushed its exploding SARS outbreak and in 2009 largely held off the swine flu pandemic while scientists brewed a vaccine. Yet public health interventions in both countries have often had a coercive edge. When Mao decreed a campaign to wipe out rural worm diseases, authorities mixed deworming drugs into salt. Health teams arrived in Chinese villages with soldiers and ordered families to bring their salt to the public square. It was washed away with fire hoses and replaced. To stem its SARS outbreak, China closed every school and most large venues in Beijing. To keep the swine flu at bay, it escorted all foreign visitors with fevers off planes into quarantine.
health,Cuba relied on harsh methods, too, to suppress its AIDS epidemic — and with great success. Until 1993, H.I.V.-positive Cubans were forced to live in bungalow colonies. Even now, at mandatory annual checkups, patients find it hard to avoid tests for sexually transmitted diseases if the doctor thinks they are warranted. Experts are just beginning to debate the effects of changing policies on public health in these two countries. China has almost a fifth of the world’s population. The one-child policy, in place since 1980, has averted an estimated 400 million births. It also lowered child mortality. One infant doted on by parents and grandparents is far more likely to survive than one of five children — to be taken to a doctor for pneumonia, for instance. Even after ending the one-child policy, China is very likely to hold onto its gains in public health, said Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. China’s “blistering rate of decline” in child mortality resulted more from new wealth than from low birthrates, Dr. Murray said. Over the last 25 years, according to a study by the institute and China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the gross domestic product went from $60 per capita to $6,800. Health improved most in the wealthiest cities, despite drawbacks like the air pollution that has plagued Beijing.
health,Also, because of exceptions for ethnic groups and rural families, the real birthrate was never just one child per woman, but closer to 1.7. While there may be some pent-up demand for more children, fertility “is almost a one-way street,” Dr. Murray said. Once countries prosper, fallen birthrates rarely rise again. Cuba’s path is a little harder to predict. The island protects children so well that it could improve only in neonatal intensive care, Dr. Murray said. An end to the United States’ economic embargo could help Cuba’s hospitals receive the advanced equipment they desperately need, along with new drugs for cancer and other illnesses. Cuba also has medical products to sell, including meningitis vaccines, a drug for diabetic foot ulcers and a lung cancer treatment, said Gail Reed, the American founder of Medical Education Cooperation With Cuba and editor of a medical journal there. But ending the embargo also poses serious risks. The primary care doctors Cuba’s system depends on are poorly paid, even though salaries tripled recently. Earlier this month, the Cuban government reinstated a requirement that doctors traveling outside the country receive a special permit. The nation has lost thousands of doctors since 2013, the government said. And prosperity itself brings risks. In Mexico, obesity, diabetes and heart disease soared as incomes rose; Cuba could face the same fate. The nation’s doctors do not manage blood pressure or cholesterol aggressively, and its cancer death rates are about equal to those in the United States.
health,“Cuba’s whole system has historically focused on top-quality outcomes for kids and mothers,” Dr. Murray said. “There’s not much emphasis on managing chronic disease in adults.”
business/dealbook,$1.6 Million Bill Tests Tiny Town and ‘Bulletproof’ Public Pensions - The New York Times Until the certified letters from Sacramento started coming last month, Loyalton, Calif., was just another hole in the wall — a fading town of just over 700 that had not made much news since the gold rush of 1849. Its lifeblood, a sawmill, closed in 2001, wiping out jobs, paychecks and just about any reason an outsider might have had for giving Loyalton a second glance. “It’s a walking ghost town,” said Don Russell, editor of the 163-year-old Mountain Messenger, a local newspaper that refuses, fittingly, to publish on the web. But then came those letters, thrusting Loyalton onto center stage of America’s public pension drama. The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, said Loyalton had 30 days to hand over $1.6 million, more than its entire annual budget, to fund the pensions of its four retirees. Otherwise, Loyalton stood to become the first place in California — perhaps in the nation — where a powerful state retirement system cut retirees’ pensions because their town was a deadbeat. “I worked all those years, and they did this to me,” said Patsy Jardin, 71, who kept the town’s books for 29 years, then retired in 2004 on an annual pension of about $48,000. Now, because of Loyalton’s troubles, Calpers could cut it to about $19,000. “I couldn’t live on it — no way,” she said. “I can’t go back to work. I’m 71 years old. Who’s going to hire me?”
business/dealbook,Public pensions are supposed to be bulletproof, because cities — unlike companies — seldom go bankrupt, and states never do. Of all the states, experts say, California has the most protective pension laws and legal precedents. Once public workers join Calpers, state courts have ruled, their employers must fund their pensions for the rest of their careers, even if the cost was severely underestimated at the outset — something that has happened in California and elsewhere. Across the country, many benefits were granted at the height of the 1990s bull market on the faulty assumption that investments would keep climbing and cover most of the cost. And that flawed premise is now hitting home in places like Loyalton. There and elsewhere, local taxpayers are paying more and more, and some elected officials say they want to get off the escalator. But Calpers is strict, telling its 3,007 participating governments and agencies how much they must contribute each year and going after them if they fail to do so. Even municipal bankruptcy is not an excuse. The showdown in Loyalton is raising the possibility that California’s pension promise is not absolute. There may be government backstops for bank failures, insurance collapses and pensions owed to workers by bankrupt airlines and steel mills — but not, apparently, for the retirees of a shrinking town.
business/dealbook,“The State of California is not responsible for a public agency’s unfunded liabilities,” said Wayne Davis, Calpers’s chief of public affairs. Nor is Calpers willing to play Robin Hood, taking a little more from wealthy communities like Palo Alto or Malibu to help luckless Loyalton. And if it gave a break to one, other struggling communities would surely ask for the same thing, setting up a domino effect. Some see a test case taking shape for Loyalton and for other cities with dwindling means. “Nobody has forced this issue yet,” said Josh McGee, vice president for public accountability for the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, which focuses in part on sustainable public finance, and a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute. When Stockton, Calif., was in bankruptcy, for instance, the presiding judge, Christopher M. Klein, said the city had the right to break with Calpers — but it could not switch to a cheaper pension plan without first abrogating its labor contracts, which would not be easy. Stockton chose to stay with Calpers and keep its existing pension plans, cutting other obligations and pushing through the biggest sales tax increase allowed by law. Loyalton — which sits in a rural area of Northern California near the Nevada border, less than an hour’s drive from Reno — severed ties with Calpers three years ago. It has no labor contracts to break. Though the town is not bankrupt, its finances are in disarray: It recovered more than $400,000 after a municipal employee caught embezzling was fired. But a recent audit found yet another shortfall of more than $80,000.
business/dealbook,“If a city doesn’t have the funds to pay, it’s just completely unclear how the legal plumbing would work,” Mr. McGee said. “I don’t know what would happen if the retirees sued.” The retirees say they are open to filing a suit but cannot afford to hire lawyers for a titanic legal clash with Calpers. “Nobody does squat for you with Calpers,” said John Cussins, Loyalton’s retired maintenance foreman, who now serves on the City Council. “I contacted every agency possible. To me, it’s just unbelievable that there isn’t some kind of help out there with the legal side of things. It leaves us at the mercy of the city and Calpers.” Mr. Cussins said he had a severe stroke last year and was recently told he had Parkinson’s disease. He needs continuing care and said he might not be able to afford his health insurance if his pension were cut. Every time the pension issue comes up at City Council meetings, he is told to leave because, as a retiree, he is deemed to have a conflict of interest. “I’d like to see somebody go to jail for this,” he said. Calpers has total assets of $290 billion, so an unpaid bill of $1.6 million would hardly be a deathblow. But if Calpers gave one struggling city a free ride, others might try the same thing, causing political problems. Palo Alto may have lots of money, but its taxpayers still do not want to pay retirees who once plowed the snow or picked up the trash in far-off Loyalton.
business/dealbook,“I think this is all about precedent setting,” Mr. McGee said. In September, Calpers sent “final demand” letters to Loyalton and two other entities, the Niland Sanitary District and the California Fairs Financing Authority. The Niland Sanitary District has struggled with bill collections, and the fairs financing authority was disbanded several years ago when the state cut its funding. Both entities stopped sending their required contributions to Calpers in 2013 but have continued to allow Calpers to administer their pension plans. In Loyalton, the City Council voted in 2012 to drop out of Calpers, hoping to save the $30,000 a year or more that the town had previously sent in, said Pat Whitley, a former mayor and a City Council member. (She is not one of the four Loyalton retirees but earned a Calpers pension through previous work on the Sierra County Board of Supervisors.) “All our audits said that our benefits were going to break the city,” Ms. Whitley said. “That’s exactly why we decided to withdraw. We decided it would be a perfect time to get out, because everybody was retired.” Loyalton did not plan to offer pensions to new workers, she said. And it had been paying its required yearly contributions to Calpers, so officials thought its pension plan must be close to fully funded.
business/dealbook,But Calpers calculates the cost of pensions differently when a local government wants to leave the system — a practice that has caught many by surprise. If a city stays, Calpers assumes that the pensions won’t cost very much, which keeps annual contributions low — but also passes hidden costs into the future, critics say. If a city wants to leave, Calpers calculates a cost that doesn’t rely on any new money and requires the city to pay the whole amount on its way out the door. That is why Calpers sent Loyalton the bill for $1.6 million. “I never dreamed it was going to be that, ever. Ever!” Ms. Whitley said. “It defies logic, really.” Loyalton’s expenditures for all of 2012 were only $1.2 million, and much of that money came from outside sources, like the federal and county governments. Local tax collections yielded just $163,000 that year, according to a public finance website maintained by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. Ms. Whitley said Calpers had snared Loyalton in a Catch-22. The agency would not tell the town the cost of terminating its contract until the contract was ended, she said. But once that was done, it was too late to go back. “We were very confused about why we owe $1.6 million, and why didn’t they tell us that before we signed all the papers,” she said. Mr. Davis, the Calpers spokesman, said that since 2011, Calpers had been giving its member municipalities a “hypothetical termination liability” in their annual actuarial reports, so there was little excuse for not knowing.
business/dealbook,Ms. Whitley disagreed. “It’s just too confusing,” she said. “I looked at what’s been happening with all the other entities, and I saw that eventually it’s got to collapse. It’s almost like a Ponzi scheme.” The bill was due immediately, but Loyalton did not pay it. It has been accruing 7.5 percent annual interest ever since. Meanwhile, Calpers has continued to pay Loyalton’s four retirees their pensions. But at a Calpers board meeting in September, some trustees said it was time to find Loyalton in default and cut the pensions. The board is expected to make a final decision at its next meeting, in November. In Loyalton, Mr. Cussins, the retiree and City Council member, said he was so frustrated about being barred from the council’s pension discussions that he and another former town worker drove to Sacramento to attend Calpers’s last board meeting. The trustees were cordial, he said, but they held out little hope. “We had a bunch of them come and shake our hands,” he said. “I said, ‘We need some guidance.’ They told us the city could apply to get back into Calpers next spring. But they made it very clear that they will not allow the city to get back into Calpers until that $1.6 million is paid.”
science,Experts Face Off on 'Noah's Flood' - The New York Times Two marine geologists from Columbia University in 1996 advanced the idea that a flood of water from the Mediterranean, rushing through the Bosporus with the force of 20 Niagaras, entered the Black Sea 7,600 years ago. In months, at most two years, the Black Sea rose, inundated surrounding plains and attained its present dimensions. As a consequence, the geologists suggested, people in the region had to flee, and this could explain the rapid spread of early agriculture into eastern and northern Europe. It was even possible, they said, that the cataclysm became a part of folk memory, inspiring the Babylonian flood myth in the epic of Gilgamesh and, in time, the biblical story of Noah. The geologists, Dr. William B. F. Ryan and Dr. Walter C. Pitman 3rd of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, elaborated their hypothesis in a book, ''Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries about the Event That Changed History,'' published in 1999 by Simon & Schuster Inc. They could not have waved a redder flag in the face of some scholars. Although many fellow geologists have found the research persuasive and the Black Sea flood plausible, and still do, archaeologists and historians were skeptical from the start. They expressed their doubts and objections, politely but firmly, in an encounter with Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pitman here on Saturday at the annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America.
science,The geological evidence for the flood may be sound, the critics said, but they thought it a stretch to ascribe to it such widespread consequences for ancient culture and mythology. ''The large claim connecting the Black Sea flood and Noah's flood can no longer be sustained,'' Dr. Andrew M. T. Moore, an archaeologist and dean of liberal arts at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said in an interview afterward. Dr. Stephanie Dalley, a historian at Oxford University in England and a specialist on Babylonian mythology, said that the ''supposed similarities'' between the Black Sea event and the flood story of Gilgamesh ''are random and wrong.'' For one thing, Dr. Dalley said, it is questionable that a folk memory would have persisted over more than 4,000 years. But suppose it had. If refugees from the Black Sea flood carried the memory with them into the Middle East, where it was eventually written on clay tablets, why is there no flood mythology in the ancient cultures of Eastern Europe, where other refugees may have migrated? Most scholars suspect that the periodic flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers is the inspiration for the Babylonian flood story. In this account, it rained seven days and nights and all dry land vanished; there were no survivors, except those in a boat. On a philosophical level, Dr. Dalley noted, the Gilgamesh epic made the point that ''before the flood, people could live forever or until the next disaster, and after the flood, people died of old age.''
science,By contrast, the Black Sea flooded not by rain but from rising sea levels far away. The water encroached steadily, but land never vanished from sight and people had time to flee. Dr. Dalley concluded that Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pitman ''have misunderstood the meaning of the flood myth in Mesopotamia, and its use in the hypothesis should be abandoned.'' Then she added, ''But the rest of the hypothesis is fine, as far as I'm concerned.'' Over the last 10 years, Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pitman have surveyed and sampled sediments submerged along the Black Sea shores and in the Bosporus, the strait leading from the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas into the Black Sea at Istanbul. They found compelling evidence, they said, that the Black Sea rose several hundred feet and submerged more than 60,000 square miles of surrounding land, a 30 percent expansion of its size. Marine shells found in the submerged lands were from Mediterranean organisms that had died about 7,600 years ago -- in 5600 B.C. Dr. Fredrik T. Hiebert, an archaeologist from the University of Pennsylvania, reported at the meeting that an underwater survey with remote-sensing technology last summer detected the stones of at least one human occupation site off Turkey's northern coast near Sinop. The submerged site appeared to be on what had been a small bluff overlooking an ancient river. ''This suggests that we will find settlements all along that submerged coast,'' Dr. Hiebert said, indicating that this might support the Ryan-Pitman hypothesis of an enormous flood.
science,Dr. Moore, who moderated the debate, said that archaeologists generally accepted the evidence that ''a natural event had significant impact for people living around the Black Sea shores, but a more distant impact is not as certain.'' Another archaeologist, Dr. Albert Ammerman of Colgate University, specifically raised questions about the supposed link between the deluge and migrations into Europe. He pointed out that there is a 200-year discrepancy between the time of the Black Sea flood and earliest evidence for settlements, in central Hungary, of what is known as the Linear Pottery Culture. These were the people who apparently introduced farming into Europe. Dr. Ryan said in an interview that new dating techniques, to be applied to some of the Black Sea sediments, should yield more precise times for the event, possibly erasing the discrepancy. Both Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pitman emphasized that their hypothesis was a work in progress. ''It's a good hypothesis, but it's not proven,'' Dr. Ryan said. The marine geologists said their continuing surveys had made another intriguing discovery. Sonar explorations of the Sea of Marmara, which feeds into the Bosporus, revealed an unusual mound more than 1,600 feet long and nearly 50 feet high, with what appears to be a ramp leading up to the summit. What is it? Dr. Ryan said core samples of the mound would be taken in October. Even if archaeologists had reservations about elements of the Ryan-Pitman hypothesis, Dr. Ammerman recommended that they begin a ''sustained long-term collaboration'' with the geologists and thus avoid ''a lot of misunderstanding and tension.''
science,In summarizing the discussion, Dr. Rita Wright, an archaeologist at New York University, welcomed the Ryan-Pitman hypothesis, whatever its suggested shortcomings. ''Models that fail also instruct,'' she said.
technology/personaltech,Taking Control of the Control Center - The New York Times Q. On the new iPhone system, where did the button for turning on AirDrop go when you swipe your finger up from the bottom of the screen? A. The iOS Control Center — that panel of icons you can quickly open by swiping up from the bottom of the phone or tablet screen — got a makeover with the release of iOS 11 in September. (iPhone X owners need to swipe down from the top-right edge of the screen to open the panel.) When you open the Control Center, press and hold the quartet of icons on the top-left side to pop open the full panel. If you have the 3D Touch feature, you can press firmly on one of the icons. The icon for AirDrop, Apple’s technology for wirelessly beaming files between iOS devices and Macs, is in the bottom-left corner of the expanded panel. The Personal Hotspot icon for turning your cellular data connection into a miniature Wi-Fi network is also visible in the full screen view. The iOS 11 software also allows users to personalize the look of the Control Center panel by adding the icons for apps and utilities used most. You can also leave others off the screen. To choose the icons you want to see, go to the iPhone’s home screen, tap the Settings icon and select Control Center. Tap the Customize Controls option, and on the Customize screen use plus and minus icons to add or subtract the listed shortcuts from the Control Center screen. You can rearrange the order by dragging the items in the list up or down using the icon of three gray lines to the right of each control.
technology/personaltech,Later, when you are using the Control Center, you can find additional shortcuts with some icons — if you are using an iPhone with 3D Touch. For example, press and hold the Camera icon to get a quick menu of shortcuts for taking a selfie, recording a video of other photographic functions. You can adjust the intensity of the flashlight beam by pressing the flashlight icon or see your last Apple Pay transaction by pressing the Wallet icon. Not every Control Center icon has a shortcut menu, though, so you may have to poke around to find the ones that do.
arts,An Ailey Dancer Loyal to His Miami Roots and Mentor - The New York Times MIAMI — Jamar Roberts has been around the world as a leading dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. But a week after Hurricane Irma swept through Miami, he was back where he started, at Dance Empire, a studio in a suburban strip of warehouses here. Life was mostly back to normal in Miami, with the towering piles of debris lining the streets the chief remaining sign of the storm. Inside the studio, attention was focused on Mr. Roberts, who was rehearsing a group of young dancers in a piece that hinted at his difficult past. He demonstrated a sequence that veered between wild, flinging movement and tense, pulsing quiet. “There’s this feeling of loss,” he said, his torso buckling. “You’re losing ground.” From a corner Angel Fraser-Logan, Empire’s owner and artistic director, looked on approvingly. “My favorite place is watching him create on my dancers,” she said. Ms. Fraser-Logan, 42, has been watching Mr. Roberts, 35, for two decades. As a teacher and a mentor, she helped him surmount a troubled home life and grow from an introverted boy who barely spoke to a world-class dancer. “She made me feel safe to express the things I wanted to express,” Mr. Roberts said, “without feeling like they were wrong, that I was wrong for wanting to dance or choreograph.” In return, he became part of her family, godfather to her children, and an inspiration to students at Empire, where he has returned regularly to teach and choreograph since he left Miami for Ailey, in New York, in 2001.
arts,Mr. Roberts, at 6 foot 4 inches, towers over Ms. Fraser-Logan (“I’m five foot nothing”). And his reserved demeanor contrasts with her animated one. But they remain tightly bound, and are now collaborating on an ambitious project highlighting Mr. Roberts’s roots here, a program of his choreography called “The House of the Most Loved,” slated for the Olympia Theater in downtown Miami in January. Mr. Roberts spent a week in mid-September rehearsing with Empire students, and will add other young dancers from the area later. He’ll travel from New York to work on the show, even as he prepares his first piece for the Ailey troupe, “Members Don’t Get Weary,” set to premiere on Dec. 8 during the company’s season at New York City Center. After the Empire rehearsal, Mr. Roberts joined Ms. Fraser-Logan and her daughter Brooke, 23, at their house, where he stays when in Miami. They sat in the kitchen, eating leftovers, telling stories about his teenage appetite, his wariness of her dogs (“where I came from dogs bite you,” he said), how he dressed up as a cartoon character for Carter, Ms. Logan’s 7-year-old son; and how he coaxed Brooke through adolescence. (She will be his choreographic assistant for the Ailey piece in New York.) Close as they are now, Mr. Roberts and Ms. Fraser-Logan come from different backgrounds. Mr. Roberts and his two brothers grew up in Goulds, a poor neighborhood he described as regularly torn by gunfire and drug busts. His family moved often, living with relatives when they couldn’t afford their own home. After Hurricane Andrew destroyed their house in 1992, he said his parents’ drug use made his family’s already chaotic home life untenable.
arts,“We just got poorer and poorer,” Mr. Roberts said. “Nights were really dark and heavy.” He found an escape in sixth grade, when he was transfixed by a dance performance at his school holiday show: girls in sparkly purple dresses whirling to a syrupy Disney tune. “My whole world changed,” he said, laughing. “They were spinning and twirling and I was like, ‘I have to do that.’ I was just drawn to the beauty of it.” His life stabilized when he and his brothers moved in with his grandmother. He transferred to an arts magnet middle school with a strong dance program. He borrowed classical music tapes so he could make up dances at home, and drew ballerinas to give to the program’s director. But he said he remained so withdrawn that he rarely talked. Ms. Fraser-Logan, by contrast, grew up in a middle-class family in Palmetto Bay. She trained at the New World School of the Arts, the Miami conservatory whose graduates include Robert Battle, the artistic director of the Ailey company. Instead of a career as a dancer, Ms. Fraser-Logan, who married at 20 and had children, turned to teaching. She was struck by Mr. Roberts, a towering ninth grader when she spotted him in the back of a modern dance class she taught at a local arts high school. “He had a chipped front tooth and jumped so high he almost hit the ceiling,” she said. Impressed, and thinking he might be an ideal scholarship student at her new studio, she offered to buy him a bus pass.
arts,For his part, Mr. Roberts said he was mesmerized by the barefoot, uninhibited Ms. Fraser-Logan: “I had never seen a teacher like that, so expressive and open.” So he showed up at her studio. “He couldn’t control how he was spinning, couldn’t stop,” she said. “But it was more graceful, with more ability than I’d ever seen.” After that first class she told him: “You don’t need to take the bus. I’ll drive you home.” Ms. Fraser-Logan became an advocate for Mr. Roberts. Through high school, she drove him home at night, paid for competitions, got his tooth fixed and used his drawings for program covers. She took him to an Ailey performance and told him “that could be you,” if he went to the New World school. Mr. Roberts’s grandmother was opposed at first, distrustful of Mr. Roberts’s growing involvement with a world that seemed alien to her. “She was not having it,” Mr. Roberts said. “She was like ‘Why do you have to go to those white people’s school when you can just go to the school right here, Homestead Senior High, where the black kids are?’ She had a lot of anxiety around raising these young boys when young boys here in Miami are so vulnerable.” Mr. Roberts said his confidence grew with Ms. Fraser-Logan’s attention. Their relationship was sealed when he unexpectedly showed up at her home one morning. “He said ‘I don’t know what to do with my life, I don’t have a mom, I don’t have someone who’s going to be there for me,’ ” Ms. Fraser-Logan said. Though not much older than he was, she promised to play that role for him.
arts,The veteran New World teacher Peter London was also instrumental in making Mr. Roberts a strikingly powerful, eloquent dancer who has become central to the Ailey troupe. (A recent review in The New York Times referred to his “gargantuan elegance” and “full-bodied commitment.”) But it was Ms. Fraser-Logan, Mr. Roberts said, who “taught me how to be an artist — the importance of dance being a form of expression and not just a physical act you do when music is on.” Now it’s his turn to mentor the next generation. The group that Mr. Roberts rehearsed at Empire included the daughter of his middle-school dance director and a girl he is coaching who won a scholarship to the Ailey school last summer. “That freedom and openness and expression I was taught by Angel,” Mr. Roberts said. “Once you tap into yourself that way, nothing else does it for you.”
arts,Auction Houses Find New Ways to Survive - The New York Times Much ink is spilled on the changes that roil businesses these days. Companies are created, then valued in the billions of dollars a couple of years later, only to be superseded shortly thereafter by a scrappy upstart. But imagine a business model created in the 18th century. How would that work in the current daunting landscape? The auction house is such a model. The twin giants of the genre, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, were founded in 1744 and 1766, and the somewhat smaller Phillips was established in 1796. In some ways it is remarkable that they are still around, given that the past decade has produced more upheavals for auctions than any of the previous ones. “I don’t know many industries that have been through so many structural changes in such a short period of time,” said Guillaume Cerutti, the chief executive of Christie’s since the beginning of this year. Christie’s is privately owned by the French billionaire François Pinault, via his holding company Groupe Artémis. It is an indication of the auction world’s close-knit club that Mr. Cerutti once worked for Sotheby’s for eight years. This year, Marc Porter returned to Christie’s as chairman of its American business; he had held the title previously, but did a short stint at Sotheby’s in the interim. Edward Dolman, the chief executive of Phillips (owned by the Russian luxury goods company Mercury Group), used to hold that title at Christie’s.
arts,Despite that familiar cast of players, the competition has grown more fierce since the Great Recession. The fight for buyers has moved to the internet and to Asia. The supply side is somewhat trickier, especially when it comes to the most valuable merchandise. To get prime material to the auction block, it looks more like messy trench warfare, with juicy incentives being offered. The year 2016 was a “slightly mellow” year for the auction houses compared with 2015, in the words of Oliver Barker, chairman of Sotheby’s Europe and one of its principal auctioneers globally. Sotheby’s is a publicly traded company, and its all-in sales total (which includes private sales) fell to $4.9 billion from $6.7 billion. Mr. Cerutti’s version of the “mellow” euphemism was that 2016 was a “transition year.” In the same year comparison, the Christie’s all-in sales total dropped to $5.4 billion from $7.4 billion. Political uncertainty was part of the equation. The elections in the United States and France had buyers and sellers on edge. “People were just waiting to see what would happen,” Mr. Cerutti said. But the vote in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, known as “Brexit,” created the most worry of all, one that continues as the long process of carrying out the decision begins. “The French traditionally had the strongest market in the world until the 1950s, and they taxed it out of existence,” Mr. Dolman said. “It went to London. And so I think market observers are watching Brexit quite carefully.”
arts,But the United States stock market has been robust this year, giving some hope. “Twenty years ago, the art market was always called a ‘lagging indicator,’ ” Mr. Dolman said. “The market would hit a peak after the stock market hit a peak. I don’t think that exists anymore. I think actually we’re pretty lock step with the market now.” Regardless of the economic context, certain trends have been underway for years. Auctions are a more diverse business over all, and that includes the items on the block. “I think that if you look at the top five lots we sold globally this year, it tells a very interesting story about the diversification of the market,” Mr. Barker said. As of Sept. 30, Sotheby’s had the top lot of 2017 so far, the untitled Jean-Michel Basquiat painting that sold in New York for $110.5 million, a record for an American work. But the second- and fourth-highest prices at Sotheby’s were for jewels. No. 2 was a pink star diamond that Sotheby’s sold for $71.2 million in Hong Kong, a record for any lot sold in Asia and for any jewel. Fueled largely by China and the sales center of Hong Kong, but also bolstered by Japan and South Korea, Asia is the explosive growth center for all of the auction houses. “For the first six months of this year, Asian buyers represented 35 percent of the span at Christie’s, which is incredible,” Mr. Cerutti said, especially given that as recently as 2000, that figure was a relatively negligible 9 percent.
arts,Rebecca Wei, the Hong Kong-based president of Christie’s Asia, chalked it up to “very stable economic growth in the region.” She added, “Political-wise we’re also quite stable.” Ms. Wei said that it was the perfect backdrop to “a mood of collecting and the confidence to spend big.” Traditionally, Asian buyers gravitated toward the classic artworks produced on their continent, but tastes have radically shifted to international modern and contemporary art, watches, wine and jewelry, mirroring the overall move in the market worldwide. The United States is still a strong driver of the market, and Asia’s gain helps make up for Europe’s loss. Though Christie’s added a new flagship office in Beijing this year (it does not conduct sales there as it does Hong Kong and Shanghai), it closed its beloved lower-priced branch in South Kensington, London — known as a true collector’s paradise, particularly for decorative arts — and moved some of those sales to its King Street headquarters. It also streamlined its operation in Amsterdam. There are still, however, headline-making sales in the Old World: In March Gustav Klimt’s “Bauerngarten” sold for $59.3 million at Sotheby’s London, though the buyer and their nationality were not identified. But Europe — the place where the big auction houses were founded, after all — is now more vital on the supply side. “From the helicopter point of view, Europe is mainly a zone of exportation,” Mr. Cerutti said. “There are more sellers than buyers.”
arts,Of course, with the digitally connected world, the physical auction location now matters less and less. “The internet is a key battlefield,” Mr. Barker said. At Sotheby’s, it most likely accounts for the fact that in 2007, buyers came from 117 countries; in 2016 that number was 126. Bringing in new buyers is crucial for any business, and among online purchases last year, 45 percent of the buyers were new to Sotheby’s. Standing at the lectern as he does presiding over major sales, Mr. Barker sees the new era firsthand. “Increasingly, I’m having to get used to a button flashing in front of me, which demonstrates that there is a client now trying to transact a bid over the internet — a major change,” he said. Online-only sales are more common every year, and not just for the lowest-value items, as was true when they were initiated. Phillips has a mobile app that offers live-streaming of auctions and real-time bidding on the lots. Starting this month and going through April, Christie’s is selling deaccessioned photographs from the Museum of Modern Art’s collection in a series of sales, some of which are online-only. One of the online sales was Henri Cartier-Bresson’s “Coney Island, New York” (1946). In terms of the categories seeing growth, contemporary art continues to rise. “Young collectors want to buy the art of their time,” Mr. Barker said, adding that it is a “gateway” to other types of art.
arts,But it is increasingly the non-art categories that occupy the attention of the houses, led by jewelry. Two years ago, Sotheby’s opened an office in Mumbai, India, a city that it sees as having huge potential as a jewelry hub. Watches are another focus. Last November in Geneva, Phillips set a record for the category when it sold a Patek Philippe for about $11 million. Like jewels, watches are small, light and do not require special storage. “Unlike a picture, it’s much more robust and easier to transport,” Mr. Dolman said. “It’s a very nice category for an auction house.” Though the hammer’s coming down on a major price in front of a crowd is good for headlines, auction houses have dealt with the pressures of the business by branching out. Private sales are increasingly important to the bottom line, as are advisory businesses — the auction houses help a collector manage her treasures, for instance, or broker acquisitions for museums. “We look at ourselves now as an art business, as opposed to historically being just an auction house,” Mr. Barker said — yet another avenue for these businesses to try to navigate from the 18th century through the 21st.
opinion,The Republican Surrender - The New York Times UPDATE: President Obama signed the bill reopening the government and lifting the debt ceiling early Thursday morning.  The Republican Party slunk away on Wednesday from its failed, ruinous strategy to get its way through the use of havoc. Hours away from an inevitable market crash, it approved a deal that could have been achieved months ago had a few more lawmakers set aside their animus. After President Obama signs the bill, the government will reopen after more than two weeks of shutdown, and the threat of a default will be lifted. The health care reform law will not be defunded or delayed. No taxes will be cut, and the deal calls for no new cuts to federal spending or limits to social welfare programs. The only things Republicans achieved were billions of dollars in damage to the economy, harm to the nation’s reputation and a rock-bottom public approval rating. “We fought the good fight. We just didn’t win,” Speaker John Boehner said, utterly failing to grasp the destruction his battle caused. It has hurt federal employees and needy people dependent on government programs, and it threatened to alter Washington’s balance permanently by giving a fringe group outsize power over the executive branch and the normal functions of government.
opinion,The deal, unfortunately, does include one minor health care provision that requires the administration to certify that procedures are in place to verify the incomes of those seeking insurance subsidies. (By the middle of next year, an inspector general will have to audit those procedures.) A White House official said the provision was virtually meaningless and would have no effect on the rollout of insurance exchanges, but the requirement was unnecessary and adds a tarnish to the president’s vow not to pay the slightest bit of ransom to Republicans. Nonetheless, the outcome vindicates the strong stance taken by Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats against the Republicans’ extortionate demands. Two years ago, when he was first confronted with the Republican refusal to raise the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama blinked and agreed to a budget control law that severely slashed domestic spending and will continue to do so for years through the sequester. Determined not to give in this time, he refused all of the most outrageous demands. The Republicans pushed the nation to the brink of default, and pulled back at the last minute when it was clear the White House would not capitulate. But this doesn’t mean the brinkmanship is over. The continuing resolution that pays for the government to reopen lasts only until Jan. 15. Democrats won a formal budget negotiation that Republicans had resisted for months, giving them a chance to relieve some of the sequester cuts. Republicans have already vowed to use the budget negotiations to keep up their attacks on the health law. “Our drive to stop the train wreck that is the president’s health care law will continue,” Mr. Boehner said in his surrender statement.
opinion,Then, on Feb. 7, the Treasury will again hit the debt ceiling. That will be closer to the midterm political season, and the futility of trying to use default as a weapon should be a fresh memory for Republicans. But many in the party remain defiant, opposing this week’s deal and vowing to keep waging their crusade. Those who refused to submit to blackmail in Washington need to remain vigilant.
sports/olympics,Host’s Pride Rests on an Aging, and Aching, Star Skater - The New York Times It has long been difficult to imagine Russia’s first Winter Olympics without Yevgeny Plushenko, and now that will no longer be necessary. Despite having barely competed in the last two years and despite having finished second at this season’s Russian national figure skating championships — he skipped the European championships altogether — Plushenko, 31, was handed Russia’s only men’s singles spot for the Sochi Games on Wednesday. That was no great surprise in light of Plushenko’s past and prominence, but it was not without debate or risk. “I have kind of a life philosophy that nostalgia’s expensive,” Scott Hamilton, a former Olympic gold medalist who is now an NBC commentator, said in an interview Wednesday. “What I’m saying is that to take such a bold stance as to send Yevgeny after all the surgeries he’s had over the last four, eight years and having not seen him really on the stage having a logical momentum going into the Olympics, they must know something pretty substantial to make that decision to send him as the sole participant.” The decision came after a highly unusual closed-door mock competition session on Tuesday in which Plushenko performed his free program for top Russian figure skating officials and reportedly completed two quadruple jumps, one in combination. The federation’s selections are subject to approval from the Russian Olympic Committee. “I had no room for error,” Plushenko later told the Russian publication Sovietsky Sport.
sports/olympics,Perhaps not, but Plushenko, the sharp-featured former wunderkind who rose from poverty to become a triple Olympic medalist and one of the most successful figure skaters, clearly had name recognition and public sentiment on his side, as well as a long history of handling pressure in a sport in which margins for error are as thin as a skate blade. The N.H.L. star Alex Ovechkin, one of the few Russian winter sports stars with a higher profile than Plushenko, has already said that Plushenko, if named to the team, should be the one carrying the Russian flag at the opening ceremony at the country’s first home Olympics in 34 years. It is not clear whether Plushenko would be available for that honor. This will be the first Olympics with a team event in figure skating, and it begins Feb. 6, the day before the opening ceremony. But there is no doubt that Sochi has been the motivation for pushing through the pain in recent years. “I have not seen him in person since an exhibition we did in Berlin a year ago, and all he could talk about was Sochi, Sochi, Sochi,” said Daniel Weiss, a former German skater turned television analyst. “Sochi was everything for him.” This is Plushenko’s latest comeback. He skipped three years of elite competition because of major injuries and outside interests before returning for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he finished second to the American Evan Lysacek in a competition best remembered for the controversy over quadruple jumps (Plushenko had one; Lysacek did not).
sports/olympics,Before the Vancouver Games, Plushenko was asked in an interview whether he could still see himself competing in Sochi. “I don’t know yet; they would like, they would like,” he said, referring to his fellow Russians. Given his age, he added, “it’s going to be too hard.” It has proved difficult indeed. His last success in a major international event came at the 2012 European championships in Sheffield, England, where he won his seventh European title in grand style. But serious back problems set him back after that, and he has required at least two operations to address disk damage brought on by the years of pounding that go with attempting triple and quadruple jumps. This season, his only appearances were at a minor event in Riga, Latvia, which he won, and at the Russian national championships, where he struggled with his jumps in the free skate and finished second to the 18-year-old Maxim Kovtun. It was Plushenko’s first loss in that competition since 1998. But while Plushenko chose not to take part in last week’s European championships in Budapest, Kovtun cracked under pressure in his free program and finished fifth over all. Two other Russian men, Sergei Voronov and Konstantin Menshov, finished second and third, behind Spain’s Javier Fernández. The door, if it was ever closed, was open again for Plushenko. “Sure, it’s pressure,” Weiss said of the closed-door session. “It’s not a practice. Yevgeny knows that, but I personally think the decision was made before.”
sports/olympics,Plushenko now has a chance to become the second figure skater to win four Olympic medals. Gillis Grafstrom of Sweden won three golds and a silver from 1920 to 1932. Plushenko took silver behind his compatriot Aleksei Yagudin in 2002; gold in 2006; and silver in 2010. The team event looks like his best chance in Sochi in light of Russia’s strength in women’s singles and pairs. “I think with him in the team competition, that definitely helps them a great deal,” Hamilton said. “Just the fact that if he remains vertical, he’s going to pull the component scores because he has that relationship with the very established group of international judges.” Hamilton added that consistency was an important element because the team event was the first of the Olympics. It will set the tone for Russia, especially after Vancouver, where Russian skaters won only two medals. The individual event, where Patrick Chan of Canada is the clear favorite, is a more daunting prospect if Plushenko takes part in it. “If he does what he did at the Russian national championships, he has no chance to medal in Sochi,” Weiss said. “You need at least one quad, if not a second quad, to medal. That’s No. 1. And No. 2, does he have the fitness to get through the tremendously hard program you have to showcase nowadays?”
sports/golf,On the PGA Tour, a Slice of Humble Pie - The New York Times AKRON, Ohio — Once in a while the card-carrying members of the PGA Tour provide proof that they are just like us. On Sunday at the Canadian Open, Kevin Chappell, who began his round one stroke off the lead, took a restricted swing from near a bush and failed to make contact with his ball. That part is familiar to high-handicappers everywhere. The next part, perhaps not so much: “That was a whiff,” Chappell said to his caddie, Joe Greiner, immediately clearing up any possible confusion about whether it had been a practice swing or an actual attempt. Chappell’s club during his takeaway broke a branch, altering its path, which caused him to miss the ball. Chappell, a 10th-year pro, described the whiff as “a little piece of humble pie” that might have helped him hone his focus. He birdied three of the next four holes to finish tied for eighth, four strokes out of a playoff. “I can’t think of another time where I’ve whiffed,” Chappell said Thursday at the Bridgestone Invitational here. “But then my wife remembered one.” Whiffs are rarer than double eagles in professional golf, and yet each of the last two tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule has produced one. At the British Open at Royal Birkdale, Justin Thomas played his second round in heavy rain. He was at even-par for the tournament when he arrived at the par-4 sixth. His five-iron approach landed in the fescue. On his third shot, the club squirted out of his hands like soap in a shower, without touching the ball.
sports/golf,“It just completely came out of my hands on the way down,” Thomas said. “On the follow-through, I had nothing in my hands.” After the whiff, Thomas hit the ball backward and then plugged a shot in fescue, setting up his quintuple-bogey 9. He went on to miss the cut by two strokes. “It’s more embarrassing and upsetting than anything else,” Thomas said. While Thomas quickly tried to put the mishap behind him, his sixth-hole fiasco stuck with Jordan Spieth’s caddie, Michael Greller, who watched Thomas’s woes unfold on television. Spieth said it was one of the first images that popped into Greller’s head after Spieth hit his now-famous wayward drive into the thick grass on the 13th in the final round. “He thought I was wanting to play that ball on 13,” Spieth said, “and he had visions of what happened to Justin.” Spieth, who went on to win the British Open, said he intended from the start to take a one-stroke penalty for an unplayable lie. He has failed enough times at trying recovery shots from inconvenient spots to recognize a hopeless lie when his ball comes to rest in one. “I’ve definitely tried to play it out of junk and whiffed,” said Spieth, who got just a piece of the ball on a 7-iron shot during the first round of last year’s Bridgestone. He said this week that he was less mortified by a whiff than, say, a shank. “On the whiff you’re just like, well, the stuff got in the way,” Spieth said.
sports/golf,Jon Rahm, a Spaniard who has two global victories in his first full season as a pro, said, “It’s not a good feeling when you whiff, but the good news is you know what the yardage is for your next shot.” Before Brooks Koepka played virtually mistake-free golf to win United States Open in June, he struggled for a few months. His nadir came in February at the Honda Classic, his hometown tournament in the Palm Beach area. He hit one of the poorest shots he could remember on the way to missing the cut. From the rough on a par-4, Koepka hit his approach sideways and the ball plopped down about a foot to the right of where he hit it. It was not technically a whiff, but it was close enough. He remembered thinking as he stared at the ball, “What just happened?” Koepka was snapped out of his shock by the voice of his caddie calmly saying, “You’ve still got 156 yards to the hole.”
sports,Michael Phelps ‘Raced’ a ‘Shark,’ Kind Of. Not Really. - The New York Times For nearly 30 years, Shark Week has been a reliable way for the Discovery Channel to create buzz for itself once a year. The public’s appetite for shark-based programming seems inexhaustible. And this year, the channel outdid itself. The centerpiece was a match race between Michael Phelps and a great white shark. Who would win? Would the shark stay in its lane, or head over to take a bite of the 23-time Olympic gold medalist? “Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White” seemed to promise to answer those questions. Anticipation was high: But then the race was broadcast on Sunday night, and the high hopes turned to disappointment. The program seemed about as realistic as a sharknado. First off, it wasn’t exactly a race. Phelps swam alone, time trial style, in the waters off South Africa. It also wasn’t exactly a shark. When the “race” was shown, Phelps was matched with a computer-generated image of a shark, supposedly simulating a real shark’s speed. The “shark” even leapt out of the water at the finish line for a conveniently spectacular visual. The show also faced the problem that sharks and people are not comparable swimmers. Not even close. Humans, even superhumans like Michael Phelps, swim no faster than 6 miles an hour. Great white sharks hit 25 m.p.h. Phelps was given a monofin, which let him swim faster than his world-record times. But he still wasn’t going to come anywhere near the shark’s top speed. This certainly seemed like a stumbling block for an interspecies race.
sports,Earlier in the program, scientists lured a shark with a fake seal to time its speed over 100 meters in a straight line. Conveniently, the time they came up with was in the range of Phelps’s speed. “I think we did our best to try to make it as close as we could,” Phelps acknowledged to Entertainment Weekly. As for the race format, it’s not clear if people expected to actually see a great white in the next lane over in an Olympic-size pool. But whatever they wanted, they didn’t get it. The program left people feeling cheated, at least the noisiest ones on social media. “The whole point is to get people excited about sharks,” Laurie Goldberg, a spokeswoman for the Discovery Channel, said. “The idea was, is it possible to get the world’s greatest swimmer competitive with a shark?” As for the shark’s speed, she said, “They are really good in bursts, but they don’t necessarily have endurance over a 100-meter race.” And for those viewers who wanted closer contact between man and beast, “We’re not going to risk Michael Phelps’s life.” She added: “In the first two minutes of the show, we make it clear we were not going to make it side by side.” At least one Twitter user mocked those who expected Phelps to be in danger of being eaten. Oh, the result? The shark “won” by two seconds. And Phelps demanded a rematch. Of course.
sports/baseball,A Twin, a Ranger and, Most of All, a Senator - The New York Times The Minnesota Twins and the Texas Rangers are in the American League playoffs together for the first time. In a general sense, each is bound to two failed Washington Senators franchises. More precisely, their ties go through a man in Huntsville, Ala. “I’m the answer to a trivia question,” Don Mincher said, rather proudly, by telephone. Mincher is 72, and for 13 seasons he was a sturdy first baseman who hit 200 home runs and played in two All-Star Games and two World Series. More remarkable, though, is his quirky place in baseball history — and this year’s playoffs. In 1960, Mincher was a Senators rookie before the franchise moved to Minneapolis and became the Twins, starting in 1961. In 1971, Mincher was a veteran player on another incarnation of the Senators when they, too, moved out of Washington, this time to become the Texas Rangers. In other words, Mincher is the only man who played for both the original Twins and the original Rangers, 11 seasons apart. And, for that matter, he was the only player to see the end of both Senators’ runs in Washington. “I got to be honest, I didn’t know it until about five years ago myself when somebody asked me that question,” Mincher said. “I would have sworn that somebody like Harmon Killebrew or Jim Lemon or Bob Allison or Camilo Pascual would have been with both. But they weren’t. It’s just something.”
sports/baseball,So, as the playoffs begin, is Mincher likely to be rooting for the Yankees? “I guess I’m a front-runner, but since the days of Mickey Mantle — who was my hero along with 10 billion other kids who grew up in that era — I’ve always been a Yankees guy,” Mincher said. “So when I turn to the sports page in the morning, I turn to the box scores, I only look for one name: Jeter. How’d he do last night? He’s kind of become the guy that I follow. I notice when he’s doing well, the Yankees win.” Mincher lives a few blocks from where he grew up in Alabama, but he was well traveled as a player. He was 17 when the Chicago White Sox signed him in 1956 and sent him to their  Class C  Northern League team in Duluth, Minn. As part of the Senators’ organization, he made his major league debut in 1960. A bench player (mostly behind Killebrew, an emerging star and a future Hall of Famer) focused on staying in the major leagues, Mincher paid little attention to the saga that would move the fifth-place Senators out of Washington. “We were going to a new place, Minnesota, where I had played before in Triple-A,” Mincher said. “I had played at that same park. It wasn’t that big a deal in my mind, but I know in other people’s minds, ownership and fans, it was a gigantic deal. I just went with the flow and did my job.”
sports/baseball,Mincher slowly blossomed with the Twins and became Minnesota’s starting first baseman in 1965, when the team went 102-60 and won the pennant. Mincher had 22 home runs batting from the left side. He was one of four Twins to hit 20 or more. “I was not bad, but I was not a Hall of Famer,” Mincher said. “If I was, I’d wear a Minnesota Twins hat in there because that was my favorite place to be. The people up there are wonderful.” Mincher homered in the second inning of Game 1 of the 1965 World Series off the Dodgers’ Don Drysdale. The Twins ultimately lost the series when Sandy Koufax outdueled Jim Kaat and four relievers at Metropolitan Stadium in Game 7. “To bat against Koufax and Drysdale when it really meant something, I didn’t realize what a big thrill it was until I got older and started thinking back on these things,” Mincher said. The Twins traded Mincher to the California Angels after the 1966 season, and the second half of his career became a dizzying series of address changes. He made the 1967 All-Star team while hitting .273 with 25 homers and 76 runs batted in, but he struggled in 1968 after he was hit on the head with a pitch. In late 1968, Mincher was the second choice in the expansion draft, selected by the Seattle Pilots.
sports/baseball,Besides accompanying two failed Washington franchises to new cities, Mincher almost had a third such last-year/first-year chapter. The Pilots played one year in Seattle — Mincher was an All-Star — before moving to become the Milwaukee Brewers. But Mincher was traded to the Oakland A’s in the off-season and never played for the Brewers. It was in May 1971 that the A’s traded Mincher to the Washington Senators, who were struggling to win games and fill seats at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium under their famous manager Ted Williams. Sure enough, they moved away after the season, to Arlington, Tex. “Ted Williams, the weather and the Dallas Cowboys,” Mincher said of his Texas memories. “My goodness, I didn’t realize what Dallas Cowboys territory that is.” Mostly, though, Mincher’s Rangers recollections revolve around Williams. “He was the most personable guy I ever met,” Mincher said. “He wasn’t that great a manager, because he didn’t really care about defense. And he just couldn’t figure out why everybody couldn’t hit .340. It was beyond his imagination that not anybody could pick up a bat and hit .340. He just couldn’t stand it.” The stint in Texas was short for Mincher. (And for Williams, who lasted one season, going 54-100.) Mincher was the team’s player representative, and said that the team owner Bob Short was agitated that he would not reveal information that led to a players’ strike in 1972. It shortened the season by up to nine games per team.
sports/baseball,“In the middle of that year, he traded me to Oakland,” Mincher said. “He got me back.” Not really. Mincher became a trusted bat off the bench for the A’s, who went on to win the World Series over the Cincinnati Reds in 1972. His last official at-bat was in the bottom of the ninth in Game 4. His one-out single to right scored the tying run, and Angel Mangual singled to score Gene Tenace and win the game. Mincher retired and returned home to Huntsville, where he remains married to Pat (50 years and counting) and raised three children (who, in turn, provided six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren). He ran a sporting goods store for about 10 years before becoming general manager of the minor league Huntsville Stars. He has been president of the Class AA Southern League for more than a decade. “I’m a minor league guy now,” he said. But he holds a unique place in major league history, too. With the Twins and the Rangers having started the playoffs, their deepest roots will be traced through Washington. But the real connection is in Alabama.
business,A Store With Media in Mind - The New York Times At a Manhattan boutique called Story, shoppers can buy delicate lingerie or intricately decorated chocolate, scented candles or underwear made by a Swedish company called Bread & Boxers. The items for sale are built around a theme: “Love Story.” But a few weeks from now, or several weeks ago, probably none of those items would be available for sale. In an exceptionally rare merchandising strategy, the store in Chelsea relies on rotating themes, as well as rotating products. “Story has the point of view of a magazine, everything changes every four to eight weeks like a gallery, and it sells things like a store,” said Rachel Shechtman, Story’s owner. “A magazine tells stories between pictures and written words, and we do it through merchandising and events. And our version of publishing is sponsorship.” Ms. Shechtman is expanding on the concept of retail media — in which companies promote items to consumers as they shop. She offers a constant merry-go-round of products, events and brands, built anew each time around a different theme. Even though Story is a tiny business, Ms. Shechtman has cobbled together a variety of revenue streams, and is finding creative ways to make money in an exceptionally difficult retail climate. As an indication that her unusual marketing tactics are succeeding, major sponsors like American Express and General Electric have paid tens of thousands of dollars to take part in one of the store’s singular themes.
business,“When you look at the square footage certain brands occupy, and you look at the amount of time consumers spend in those spaces, why isn’t that a media channel?” Ms. Shechtman said. The time spent shopping in a store, she continued, “is more than the 30 seconds spent flipping through the pages of a magazine.” Sponsorships, Ms. Shechtman said, can cost anywhere from $75,000 to $300,000. Every month or two, the store opens with a new theme. Color Story, which was sponsored by Benjamin Moore, offered merchandise like colorful wireless speakers, bright cashmere socks and lipstick. Home for the Holidays, sponsored by American Express, sold a little something for every gift giver, including headphones, purses, books and bitters for mixing drinks. The store’s events are themed as well, with Wellness Story offering yoga and Pilates classes, and New York Story hosting a mixology class. Another major company that has been willing to give Ms. Shechtman’s “retail as media” theory a try is General Electric, which partnered with Ms. Shechtman for a “Making Things” theme. While there were some products to buy — like a build-it-yourself robot that draws, and 3-D printed jewelry — much of the floor space was devoted to G.E. machines that customers could play around with, like 3-D printers and laser cutters. Most of Ms. Shechtman’s revenue in that period came from the sponsorship. Beth Comstock, chief marketing officer at G.E., said that the store’s theme offered customers a way to interact with the company’s brand.
business,“It’s not like most people are going to be able to come into an aircraft engine factory and make stuff,” she said. “There is a huge value for brands in having a place where you can experiment,” Ms. Comstock added. “And to have a lab that actually creates a profit and a recurring revenue stream, and gives people a good experience, there’s something really compelling about that.” Home Depot has also used Story to experiment, even though it has more than 2,200 stores of its own. Trish Mueller, Home Depot’s chief marketing officer, said the company used the store as a “live lab,” noting that the space is heat-mapped, so it detects the movement of customers as they stop to investigate certain products or walk past others. (Home Depot has not sponsored a specific theme, but has a continuing relationship with Story. Ms. Mueller declined to provide details of the partnership, saying she did not want to tip her hand to the competition.) “I think it’s a very revolutionary type of retail: ephemeral retail,” Ms. Mueller said. “The concept of product as content.” Still, Story is also fundamentally a place to buy stuff. Much of what’s for sale comes from small brands and designers, some of whom were discovered at a “pitch night” where designers offer their wares to Ms. Shechtman and her team. And while most merchandise changes with each new theme, there are a few constants, like some jewelry and a stash of New York City items kept on hand for tourists.
business,Perhaps Story’s most unusual attribute, however, is that it shuts down the entire 2,000-square-foot store for about a week when it switches themes. “It’s quite unique,” Burt P. Flickinger III, a retail consultant, said of the store. Ms. Shechtman declined to share precise profits and revenue, but she said gross revenue for Story was a seven-figure sum and its profit was in the six-figure range. She said the store was profitable in its first year. Nonetheless, there is no obvious road map for expanding this type of business. Thrillist Media Group, an online company aimed at men, also offers a mix of storytelling and retail — some staff members write stories for their target audience, while other employees try to sell them things like clothing or shaving kits. Thrillist entered the e-commerce business less than four years ago and had over $75 million in revenue last year, according to a founder, Ben Lerer. Story has a website, but after two years in business, nothing is sold on it. “We should have had e-commerce three months after we launched,” Ms. Shechtman said. “We’re profitable, so I feel like we’re in a healthy place, but to get to the next level, potentially we’ll need either a strategic investment or an acquisition.” Ms. Shechtman said she had been approached by investors and retailers, but declined to go into detail.
business,Ms. Shechtman, 36, is a fourth-generation retailer (her sister, Jenny Shechtman, 34, works in operations at Story) and an experienced brand consultant. She founded her store with money borrowed from two friends, and, as a regular speaker at conferences and an enthusiastic networker, she has managed to plug herself deeply into the world of retail. She counts among her fans Donna Karan, Ms. Mueller of Home Depot, and Martha Stewart. In an interview, Ms. Stewart compared Ms. Shechtman’s passion to that of Ralph Lauren and Millard S. Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew. Some retail executives and consultants say they think Story would work in other major cities like Los Angeles or London. Ms. Shechtman suggested that a version of the store, more narrowly focused on one demographic, like children or women, could work more broadly across the country. She acknowledges, however, that the version that works in Chelsea would probably not thrive in smaller cities where brands don’t feel the need to have a presence. Ms. Shechtman has expanded the business in some ways, however. She started a consulting firm, Show and Tell, which will produce pop-up events and installations, and signed up for corporate office space. She has also hired some new full-time employees, which she hopes will allow her to accomplish her most immediate goal. “I have no life,” she said. “My New Year’s resolution was to change that.”
style,ON THE STREET; Fashion Flower - The New York Times This spring, the flower -- live, silk or beaded -- has reappeared attached to a ribbon choker. Wearing blossoms was a favorite custom through the ages, providing fragrance for the wearer. In 18th-century France, a fresh flower was often worn at the neck or in the cleavage. In the early 20th century, Edwardians had sprays of orchids dripping from their shoulders. This style turned into the corsage, which some mothers of the bride have discretely removed to the handbag. Others wear them at the waist or on the wrist. The current idea originated with Tom Ford, who made the flower choker his signature at his first Saint Laurent ready-to-wear show last fall, and women at his second show, in March, adopted the look with their daytime pantsuits. One wearer, top right, innovatively floated a fresh gardenia from an invisible nylon fishing line.
us,Scenes of Exultation in Five States as Gay Couples Rush to Marry  - The New York Times SALT LAKE CITY —  When Gregory Enke heard the news on Monday morning, he woke up Ariel Ulloa, his partner of eight years, and they rushed to the second floor of a drab government building here to get married. Mr. Enke, who was forced to leave the Mormon Church after leaving his longtime wife and living openly in a gay relationship, said it felt like vindication. “I was in shock,” he said. “I started to shake. I was just sobbing. I didn’t want to wait anymore.” Scenes of exultation unrolled across five states on Monday as county clerks in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin responded almost instantly to the Supreme Court decision and same-sex couples rushed to obtain legal marriages that had long seemed like a distant mirage. Preparations moved swiftly for legalized same-sex marriage in six other states where bans were almost certain to be overturned in coming days and weeks as a result of the ruling, and at least one county in one of those states, Colorado, began issuing marriage licenses even before getting clearance from above. In Arlington, Va., Erika Turner and Jennifer Melsop had been planning to wed next August in the District of Columbia, where same-sex marriage is already legal. But when Ms. Melsop, a veterinary assistant, read on Facebook about the Supreme Court decision ending Virginia’s ban, she went running to her partner.
us,“She came up to me, crying, and said, ’I think we can get married today,’ ” Ms. Turner, a registered nurse, explained moments after the pair, both 26, became the first same-sex couple to wed in Arlington County. The two filled out a county form whose wording had been altered from “Bride & Groom” to “Spouse & Spouse.” Under a blue sky outside the courthouse, they held hands and exchanged vows. With tears in their eyes, they kissed as a local minister declared them “wife and wife” forever. In Oklahoma City, dozens of same-sex couples crowded in the county clerk’s office, and the Mayflower Congregation Church U.C.C., a large, mostly gay church, made plans to hold a group wedding and celebration Monday evening. Ben Adams and Kris Gray of Edmond, Okla., have been together 10 years and adopted their son, Harvey, from birth in Texas four years ago. Their son had been asking about marriage, Mr. Adams said, and “we wanted to be able to tell him, ‘Yeah, we’re married.’ ” In state after state, activists and officials alike said they had been taken by surprise by the Supreme Court’s decision to refuse to hear any of the same-sex marriage cases before it — a decision that left standing in a number of states the appeals court rulings declaring same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. “Not one of us was ready for this decision today,” said Peggy Tomsic, the lawyer for the six who brought the suit against Utah last year that was the first of dozens of court victories for same-sex marriage. “We couldn’t be any more thrilled.”
us,In part because of the surprise and also because many same-sex couples in some states, including Utah and Wisconsin, were able to marry during brief windows after court decisions in the last year, county offices were not overwhelmed with applicants. Joseph J. Czarnezki, the Milwaukee county clerk, said no same-sex couples had applied for a marriage license there by late afternoon. When Judge Barbara B. Crabb of Federal District Court struck down the state’s ban this year, the county issued 273 licenses in the brief period before she stayed the ruling. While some gay rights advocates were disappointed that the Supreme Court did not take up the marriage issue directly, for a final resolution, activists across the country were elated by what now appears to be a clear path to a nationwide victory in the coming months and years. Conservative political leaders who oppose same-sex marriage, and had hoped that the Supreme Court would uphold the right of states to decide the issue, expressed concern. William J. Howell, the Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, expressed disappointment in the court’s decision, and criticized Mark Herring, the state’s Democratic attorney general, for refusing to defend the state’s ban on marriage, adopted in a constitutional amendment in 2006. Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, a Republican, said: “I can tell you that I’m surprised about this and disappointed. I believe that the people deserve to have this hearing taking place at the Supreme Court level to determine what is a significant issue of our time.”
us,But he said Utah would abide by the law and swiftly instructed county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses and state agencies to extend legal benefits to married same-sex couples. “For us, it’s over,” said Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican, according to The Associated Press. “The federal courts have ruled,” he said, “and we will be upholding it.” Indiana’s governor, Mike Pence, a Republican, said that he still opposed same-sex marriage but that the state must obey the decision. Some county clerks began issuing marriage licenses, but others said they would await official instructions, which the attorney general said may come later in the week. Legal groups and state officials also sprang to action in the six other states that fall under the jurisdiction of the same three federal appeals courts involved in Monday’s ruling: Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. Challenges to marriage laws are already pending in each of them, and federal judges, following the circuit courts, will be obliged to issue judgments striking down existing bans. In Colorado, Attorney General John W. Suthers said the state would start issuing marriage license to same-sex couples as soon as the appeals court issued a final order, which he expected to occur “very shortly.” But at least one county, Pueblo, proceeded to issue licenses on Monday. Same-sex couples in Kansas made plans to force the issue by applying for marriage licenses, said Thomas Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas.
us,“People are taking the afternoon off work to go apply for marriage licenses,” Mr. Witt said, even though the Kansas ban remains the law for now. Chief Judge William L. Osteen Jr., of the Federal District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, indicated that he was ready to strike down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage. Three gay couples who had challenged West Virginia’s marriage restrictions asked a federal judge to lift the stay he had issued this year. State officials said they were considering whether to keep defending the ban in court. Some states vowed to resist the tide. In South Carolina, rights advocates prepared to file a court motion as state officials indicated that they were in no hurry to change policy. Attorney General Alan Wilson said that because the case involving the South Carolina ban remained unresolved, state officials would continue to enforce and defend the marriage restrictions. In Wyoming, too, Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, said, “The attorney general will continue to defend Wyoming’s Constitution defining marriage between a man and a woman.”
us,Reeking, Oozing Algae Closes South Florida Beaches - The New York Times STUART, Fla. — A rancid smell penetrated the front of Marisa and Duncan Baskin’s one-story house, which rests less than 100 feet from an inlet of the St. Lucie River in this tourist hamlet just inside the Atlantic coastline that bills itself as “America’s Happiest Seaside Town.” But the Baskins — whose 22-month-old daughter, like Ms. Baskin, suffers from asthma — and their neighbors are not so happy these days. In the water of the inlet of their subdivision in Northriver Shores, an inch-thick layer of bubbling ooze and slime emits a stench so overwhelming that none of the neighbors go outside. In fact, the Baskins were preparing Friday to stay with friends across town for the weekend just to get away from the green and blue algae bloom that has overtaken their small neighborhood marina, from which most neighbors have moved their boats. “Our lives revolve around the water; we have a boat, surfboards, and there’s nothing really to do here without the water,” Ms. Baskin, 31, a lifelong resident of Stuart who works as a social worker at a local hospital, said Friday. “And I think our governor and local politicians are to blame. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but it’s definitely the worst.”
us,At play are many of the forces that define modern Florida: competing environmental, residential and agricultural interests, a failure by state officials to invest in managing the demands of growth, finger pointing between state and federal officials. The result has been an environmental nightmare playing out here, about 35 miles from the source of the problem in Lake Okeechobee. There, an aging dike system forces the Army Corps of Engineers to release controlled discharges through channel locks east and west from the lake to protect nearby towns from flooding. However, those discharges, which carry pollutants from agricultural lands that flow into the lake from the north, pour into rivers and lagoons downstream, which eventually dump into the ocean. When too much polluted discharge from Okeechobee hits areas downstream like the St. Lucie River estuary in Stuart, for example, the blend of fresh and salt water creates giant phosphorescent plumes of algae, making the water unsafe for human and aquatic life alike. This week, Gov. Rick Scott declared states of emergency in Martin, St. Lucie, Palm Beach and Lee Counties, and Senators Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, both visited the scene, expressing concern. The Corps of Engineers is dealing with a dike nearly 80 years old with structural problems. It was originally designed during a time when environmental preservation was not an issue. Engineers also have to balance the concerns of environmentalists with the need to safeguard area residents — more than eight million people are affected by the water system, according to a corps spokesman, John Campbell.
us,“We’re constantly having to balance the potential of an environmental impact from releasing water against the very real public safety hazard of containing the water and the hazard that poses by putting pressure on the dike itself,” Mr. Campbell said by telephone Thursday from Jacksonville, Fla. “The system is so constrained that everything that was low-hanging fruit has been done so far. We are left with few options or constraints to work with.” He said the water levels the Army Corps gauges to determine how to react to discharges are between 12.5 feet and 15.5 feet. The lake is currently at 14.9 feet, roughly a foot higher than it was during the last crisis at the same time of year in 2013, Mr. Campbell said. With hurricane season yet to come, the Army Corps still has to carefully determine how to release and plug the dikes. It takes roughly one month to release six inches of water from the lake, Mr. Campbell said, so if significant rains fell, the dike could have “performance issues” and the Army Corps would have to take precautions to prevent a disaster that would bring “widespread damage and problems, especially if the water goes south, which is where the water wants to go anyway.” But residents along the coast are tired of the excuses. They say there is enough blame to go around at both the state and federal levels, with Big Agriculture playing a significant role.
us,“Everybody’s known about this problem for years — that there’s a big algae bloom, and now it’s worse than 2013,” Richard Day, 51, who has lived in Stuart since 1973 and works as an auto mechanic at a downtown garage, said Friday. “I’ve got friends who captain boats and they’re moving south to Jupiter in Palm Beach County. It’s just sad.” Mark Perry, executive director of the Florida Oceanographic Society, based in Stuart, said the state’s inability to close a deal to purchase thousands of acres of land south of Lake Okeechobee — to create a natural runoff from the lake into the Florida Everglades, where the diverse ecosystem could naturally filter toxins from the north — has been to blame for the problems being experienced by communities west and east of the lake like Stuart. But the area south of the lake has been controlled by sugar farmers for decades, and environmentalists like Mr. Perry say state legislators in Tallahassee kowtow to agricultural lobbyists who fund their re-election campaigns. “The flow used to go south to the Everglades, and now this is a man-made, criminal disaster,” Mr. Perry said. “They, as in the state and federal government, say they can’t send the water south, but they can. This is an absolute atrocity that they are allowed to continue this in the name of agriculture. This is the worst I’ve ever seen it.”
us,The 2016 sugar harvest was the longest on record because of rain delays, making it also one of the most profitable on record, resulting in 2.15 million tons of sugar. Under Mr. Scott, the board of the South Florida Water Management District failed in 2015 to carry out a plan to buy roughly 47,000 acres of land from U.S. Sugar south of Lake Okeechobee that would have acted as a reservoir for the lake’s runoff. “The political leadership has not been putting the demand on the agencies to fix the problem,” Mr. Perry said. “This water was never meant to go east and west — it was meant to go south.” Here in Stuart, where the algae lapped up on area shorelines, keeping public beaches closed — a first in the area — Ms. Baskin and her daughter stood outside in their front yard, wincing at the smell. She said she and her husband were considering whether to sell the home they purchased just two years ago. No one else was seen around the neighborhood. “Normally there are kids outside playing,” she said. “But not right now — it’s a ghost town.”
world/asia,North Korea Warns South Over Leaflets - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea —  North Korea’s state-run news agency said on Saturday that the country’s plans to resume high-level government dialogue with South Korea were in danger of being canceled after troops from both sides exchanged machine-gun fire across the heavily armed border. North Korea opened fire on Friday after anti-Pyongyang activists in the South sent large balloons sailing across the border with leaflets criticizing the North’s government. South Korean troops fired back. The episode came days after the two countries had agreed to resume government talks to discuss improving ties. In a commentary published on Saturday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said that the leaflets were “an intolerable political provocation” and “psychological warfare,” and that Seoul and Washington were behind them, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. Blaming the South for failing to stop the activists, it said that inter-Korean relations were “disintegrating into a catastrophe” and that the planned talks had been “all but scrapped.” Still, the North appeared to leave room for negotiation, saying the future of the relationship was “up to the attitude of the South Korean authorities.” The agency is Pyongyang’s mouthpiece, and its commentaries closely reflect the views of top government leaders. North Korea has repeatedly demanded that the South stop the activists, most of them defectors from the North, from sending the leaflets. Seoul has insisted that it cannot meddle in the private citizens’ campaign.
world/asia,But as the North’s threats to attack have escalated, the South Korean police and villagers near the border have begun blocking some activists.
us,An Imperiled Newspaper’s Threads in a Small City’s Fabric - The New York Times BRISTOL, Conn. In an office so quiet as to be disruptive, a man sits amid the detritus of his chosen career. The collected reports of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, Volume One. A letter seeking publicity for an event sponsored by the Litchfield County chapter of Hadassah. Stacks of newspapers, days, weeks, months old. Heavyset, world-weary, this is William Sarno, 63, editor of an ancient and endangered newspaper called The Bristol Press. His glorified cubicle looks out upon a dimly lighted newsroom whose collection of vacated desks gives the sense that nearly the entire staff left one day to cover a big story and never came back. One or two reporters bob in the sea of emptiness, talking on telephones, typing notes, while on a wall there glitters a limp strand of holiday lights, hung before last Christmas and plugged in just the other day. The mood they convey is less festive than determined-to-be-festive. Last month the newspaper’s financially troubled owner, the Journal Register Company, announced that The Bristol Press and a sister newspaper, The New Britain Herald, would cease to publish if not sold — cheaply, by the way — by mid-January. Given the dire state of newspapers, Mr. Sarno and his hard-news colleagues are steeling themselves for an outcome that would make one helluva story if it weren’t so personal. The Press, after all, has been covering Bristol since 1871.
us,“We’re going to go forward until somebody says we’re not,” Mr. Sarno says, saying things he has to say. “I don’t know what the last edition is going to say. ... It’s a business decision. ... At times I get anxious, but then I get busy. ... This is what I am; this is what I do.” He fumbles to answer the ringing telephone, whose cord is wound in knots. “We don’t use office supplies very much,” he patiently, even sweetly, tells the cold caller. He hangs up, then mutters, “I didn’t want to tell him we need black bunting.” Yes, this is another story about a newspaper in jeopardy, one that may well prompt dismissive responses about Paleolithic business models and pointless mourning over throwaway sheets of paper and ink. In other words: Get over it, hack, your day is done. And it is true that even among the newsprint faithful, few weep for the Journal Register Company, brought down as much by its own bad business decisions as by declining advertising revenues. Often derided as a profit-mad, quality-journalism-be-damned company, it would begrudge the electrical cost of those holiday lights now faintly brightening the Bristol Press newsroom. But if this is the future, at least let us pause to appreciate what a small, imperfect daily newspaper means to this small, imperfect city, where the clocks and watches of America were once made, where General Motors once produced its ball bearings, where ESPN is based, and where springs — yes, unheralded yet essential customized springs — are produced.
us,Let us pause long enough to notice that copy of The Bristol Press sitting on the sleek gray counter of the Applewood diner, its crossword puzzle half-complete, its clue for 20 across, five letters — “positive thinking” — unanswered. Most mornings a customer leaves behind a copy for the perusal of those who follow. But if no copy has appeared by 6 a.m., Sarah the waitress hurries to the red vending machine outside to buy what might be called the house copy. Let us watch, too, as Greg Fradette, 61, insurance agent and son of Bristol, savors his cream of mushroom soup at the Tortoise and the Hare Café, chats with his wife, Lolly, sings a bit of the Christmas song playing on the radio, then suddenly says: “Oh! I gotta get a paper.” He hustles outside, feeds two quarters into a machine and returns with a copy of The Press. In this city where, he says, “springs are big,” the newspaper matters because it contains the intense coverage of sports at the high school and City Hall level; the listings of births, deaths and potluck suppers. “The information you take for granted,” Mr. Fradette says. The Press has chronicled daily life here in central Connecticut since the days of Reconstruction, marking time like those Bristol-made clocks. In the 1910s it was anti-immigrant and anti-labor. In the 1920s it warned local members of the Ku Klux Klan that it knew their names. In the 1940s it published the names of 139 uniformed men from Bristol who were killed in World War II.
us,And in the 1980s its local owners sold The Press to Worcester County Newspapers, a Massachusetts-based publishing company. Immediately, something was lost; the local newspaper became a card in a high-stakes game played far from the hills of Bristol. Steve Collins, the longtime City Hall reporter for The Press, remembers the newsroom as it was when he arrived in 1994. Seven reporters, five editors, three sportswriters, some paid summer interns — and some 20,000 subscribers. Police scanner crackling, television shouting, phones ringing, the place hopped. A few months later the Journal Register Company bought The Press, and Mr. Collins recalls changes both immediate and gradual. The presses on the first floor quickly fell silent, as the company moved its printing operations to Torrington, 18 miles away, as part of a consolidation. As the years passed, including one in which the company’s chief executive collected a $10 million bonus, the number of Bristol Press employees shrunk. “We just slowly lost people,” Mr. Collins says of colleagues — though, with circulation dropping to about 8,000, he might as well have been talking as well about readers. Mr. Sarno, who, like many newspaper veterans, fondly recalls the newsroom gluepots of long ago, has worked at The Press since 1986, save for a three-year intermission. He was the wire editor for many years, but after most editing was moved to the New Britain office, he was made editor. “It’s like a battlefield promotion,” he says.
us,Today, his editorial responsibilities include handling the good and bad wishes of callers. I’ll miss you guys, they say. I don’t know what I’ll do if you stop publishing, they say. Good riddance, they say. “It’s a personal relationship,” he says. “Whether they hate the paper or love the paper, it’s their newspaper.” Declining to talk in particular about the Journal Register Company — which did not return a call seeking comment — he says he knows full well that newspapers are in free fall. Just look at The Hartford Courant, this state’s dominant newspaper, whose owner, the Tribune Company, filed for bankruptcy last week. Still, he wonders about stories untold if The Bristol Press were to fold. Stories like that of Matt Lavoie, a Bristol boy who became an Army corporal, went to Iraq and nearly died in a roadside bombing. That was front-page news here, as was the “pasta supper fund-raiser” for the soldier, held at Nuchie’s Restaurant. Who knows what will replace The Bristol Press if it becomes another business out of time in this old city of watches and clocks? Maybe a weekly newspaper will step up to serve the community’s needs, or a well-crafted Web site dedicated to all things Bristol will appear. For now, a heavy-hearted editor will continue to be who he is, and do what he does. And a small band of reporters, working for a small, imperfect newspaper, will record for posterity the challenges facing a wounded soldier; the fire that roared through an animal shelter and the number of cats (30) and dogs (9) saved; the death of an 88-year-old woman named Henrietta; and the birth of a girl named Ava Marie.
technology,AT&T’s Strategy Is One Part Innovation, One Part Inspiration - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — AT&T is pulling out the stops to persuade people about futuristic plans for its network — and itself. Sometimes that means pushing new technology, and sometimes it means that executives show a little vulnerability, something rare in corporate America. The company recently announced that in the next quarter it would be working with Ericsson and Intel on so-called fifth generation, or 5G, wireless technology. Before the end of the year, AT&T said, it would be carrying out field trials of the fast wireless technology in Austin, Tex. That is important for several reasons. Analysts have worried that AT&T was not providing any information about what it was doing in 5G. Moreover, if the field trials work as planned, the company will have the means to offer millions of homes and businesses much faster speeds without having to dig numerous trenches and lay a great deal of fiber optic cable. With a network running potentially at gigabits a second, as this one would, it would be possible to download a feature film in a couple of seconds, or simultaneously operate a number of complex business or consumer functions. John Donovan, chief strategy officer and president for technology and operations, said AT&T had held back talking about 5G because it wanted to have a system that combines network speeds and the ability to handle cloud computing software and big data analysis.
technology,“Everything we do has to do all of these things well,” Mr. Donovan said. As his comment indicates, AT&T is not just worried about network speeds and how they compare with the competition. The company is also concerned about how the network absorbs information and adjusts to what it learns. All that is leading AT&T to make new demands on its work force. Mr. Donovan, who oversees more than 140,000 employees, wants them learning new things fast. In an effort to get them moving faster, last March at a global gathering for all those people (many watching on video) the executive, previously a partner at the consulting firm Deloitte and the chief of sales at the Internet company Verisign, talked about growing up poor in a family of 11 children in Pittsburgh. His father died 30 years ago, when Mr. Donovan was finishing college. The point, reinforced by a video of his mother, was about being able to imagine yourself in different circumstances, then to persevere in getting there. “It was harder than you can possibly imagine,” Mr. Donovan said of talking about this in front of his staff. “When you get to the top of an organization this size, people expect nothing but confidence.” The talk included such ideas as accepting who you are, building a long-term plan, learning nonstop, working to the limits of your talent and accepting that a work-life balance is not always possible. These are the same things Mr. Donovan and his associates at the top of AT&T are now asking from thousands of people, under threat of corporate failure if they cannot adapt.
technology,Nonetheless, Mr. Donovan thinks his talk was warmly received, and then some. “I get a lot of people asking how my mother is doing,” he said. “I have people once or twice a week saying they are praying for me. It’s kind of overwhelming.”
world/middleeast,Syria Violence Leads U.N. Envoy to Push Back Date for Peace Talks - The New York Times GENEVA — As artillery shells and airstrikes shook several Syrian towns and cities, a United Nations mediator said Thursday that although the time was not right for new talks between the warring parties, it was urgent that they resume by early August. The United Nations’ special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters in Geneva that the next round of peace talks needed to produce concrete steps toward a political transition to end the war. He said Aug. 1 was the target date for resuming negotiations. That date represents a step back from a deadline, set in March by the 17-nation International Syria Support group, for achieving agreement on a political transition in Syria by the start of August. But prospects for achieving even the amended goal looked uncertain, with the conflict moving back to all-out war on fronts in the north, east and south of Syria and around Damascus, the capital. Russian and Syrian government airstrikes have resumed with increasing intensity on the rebel-held eastern side of Aleppo, producing dozens of casualties each day this week, according to residents, rescue workers and antigovernment activists. Harrowing images are emerging of dead and wounded children in Aleppo and of people grieving over victims. Airstrikes in rebel-held areas Wednesday hit three hospitals, including a pediatric center supported by Unicef.
world/middleeast,The director of the pediatric center, which is operated by the Independent Doctors Association, a nonprofit humanitarian group based in Gaziantep, Turkey, said in an email Thursday that the bombing had shattered windows and broken ceilings and doors, forcing the hospital to close until at least Saturday. Mortar shells fired by rebels Wednesday and Thursday killed at least 20 people in government-held parts of Aleppo, according to the state-run news agency, SANA. One group of Islamist militants, the Nusra Front, has also been leading an offensive south of Aleppo and has retaken some of the territory that Syrian government forces seized with the help of Russian airstrikes. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, underscored the urgency of achieving at least “the beginnings” of a serious agreement by the start of August, telling reporters in New York on Thursday that “without a political horizon and discussions on the transition, a further escalation is all too likely.” Mr. de Mistura said the Aug. 1 target “should be attainable,” but he cautioned that the next round of talks needed to be “a concrete one.” He said he would convene the meeting only if he saw that there were “some concrete intentions and critical mass for producing this time political transition steps.” To prepare for the broader negotiations, he said, he will soon begin to hold informal technical talks that will dig into details of a political transition, like the future of Syria’s army and government institutions.
world/middleeast,Mr. de Mistura emphasized, though, that the success of any peace talks required a reduction of violence and improved access for aid agencies delivering food and other supplies to hundreds of thousands of besieged civilians. The United Nations reported on Thursday that the Syrian government had approved its requests for access to 15 of the 19 communities under siege or cut off by fighting. But “there are a lot of actions that need to take place between approval and delivery,” Mr. de Mistura said, alluding to the obstruction of aid convoys at roadblocks and the removal of medicine and other supplies from the trucks. Late Thursday, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said a food convoy had reached Daraya, Agence France-Presse reported, providing a hint of progress. Last week, the government approved the delivery of aid to Daraya for the first time in four years, but it denied the delivery of food, the most urgently needed commodity. Earlier, Mr. de Mistura cited concerns among members of the international support group that the Syrian government’s approvals for aid deliveries were accompanied by “punishment” in the form of military attacks on communities receiving the aid. The arrival of food aid in Daraya, a suburb of Damascus, came only hours after a bombardment of the town, including strikes on a mosque. Damascus residents said 10 to 15 large explosions had been heard overnight from the direction of Daraya as helicopters dropped bombs on the town.
world/middleeast,On a more positive note, Mr. de Mistura said he had heard from Russia that the Syrian government might have released “a substantial number” of prisoners. He speculated that the government might have intended to make a good-will gesture coinciding with the holy month of Ramadan or was simply addressing “what is a huge concern and huge problem.” But he said he was still waiting for confirmation that any prisoners had been freed.
your-money,A Liability Risk for Airbnb Hosts  - The New York Times Over the last few years, Uber and Airbnb have come to be known as leaders of something called the sharing economy. Give their founders credit for this feat of mostly misplaced nomenclature. The companies help people sell rides in cars and rent stays in homes; they deserve no more credit for promoting a skill learned in preschool than Marriott or taxi companies. But here’s one thing they do love to share: risk. Uber grew by heaping it on many drivers, asking them to push damage claims through their personal insurance companies while knowing that those companies did not cover commercial activity. And now comes Airbnb with its free $1 million liability coverage that will cover the hosts for its tens of thousands of United States listings. How can it afford to provide this for nothing, to everybody? Well, it is “secondary” coverage, which means that it, too, wants hosts to push any claims for guests’ injuries and deaths through hosts’ own insurance companies first. So how might that work in practice, or would it at all? This week, I sent 17 questions about Airbnb’s move and short-term rentals in general to the biggest home insurance companies in the United States as ranked by SNL Financial. One thing came through loud and clear from the handful of companies that did not dodge my inquiries entirely: Most homeowner’s and renter’s insurance policies do not cover regular commercial activity in the home.
your-money,“If you’re conducting a business, on a full- or part-time basis, by renting out your home or apartment (or a room in your home or apartment) as a way to earn money, your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy probably would not provide liability coverage,” said Rebecca Hirsch, a USAA spokeswoman, in an email. Here’s what Oregon’s insurance commissioner had to say to Airbnb hosts in a September consumer advisory statement: “Homeowner policies generally do not provide coverage for business use.” Insurance companies are not fond of liars either, nor of people who conveniently neglect to tell them that they are running a small-scale hotel. “An insured has the obligation to be forthcoming about all facts relating to his/her insured property. Not doing so could impact coverage and jeopardize the continuation of insurance,” said Laura Strykowski, an Allstate spokeswoman. So why would Airbnb offer secondary liability coverage at all if it knows that most hosts’ primary insurers frown on their getting into the hosteling business? Three reasons. First, it had to do something, and fast; there’s a new ordinance in San Francisco requiring hosts to have at least $500,000 in liability coverage. Hosts probably would not have gotten their acts together without the company’s help. Second, it knows that some insurance companies have exceptions of various sorts. Allstate allows people to rent out their home for a week or two while still maintaining liability coverage for people who stay there. Ms. Hirsch of USAA said that for people who “very occasionally rent a room out (as opposed to doing this as a business), liability coverage may be available.” Chubb offers coverage as long as you’re not taking in more than $15,000 a year in rental income, which it believes is more generous than most other insurance companies.
your-money,Insurers handle claims on a case-by-case basis. Facts matter. Lawyers get involved and exploit loopholes. Hey, it could all work out well for Airbnb, at least some of the time, right? Clearly, the company thinks it’s worth trying. The third reason is more basic: It would cost Airbnb enormous amounts of money to offer primary coverage to every host. How much? Well, consider the efforts of its competitor, HomeAway. That company encourages its own hosts to purchase primary coverage for their rental properties, an offering that it refers to as HomeAway Assure. Scott Wolf, president of the program division for CBIZ Insurance Services, which provides the Assure policy, broke the host’s cost down: For a $1 million, four-bedroom home with contents worth $100,000, the annual cost of coverage would be about $3,000, which includes any damage, liability coverage and replacement of rental income in case the home is temporarily uninhabitable. Most Airbnb properties are worth less than this, its hosts may rent only part of their homes and do so less often, and the company would get a bulk discount if it were to buy coverage for all of them. Still, multiply that times 800,000 listings and it’s easy to see why it’s out of the question for Airbnb to hand out primary coverage to everyone.
your-money,So why doesn’t the company do what HomeAway does and offer hosts the option to buy a ready-made primary insurance solution for their renting activities? “We wanted the experience for our hosts to be automatic and easy and offer real peace of mind,” said Jonathan Golden, the Airbnb product leader who has been working on insurance issues for over three years, “versus going to another site and potentially having to purchase another policy.” Free is indeed appealing to hosts who feel the pain every time Airbnb takes 6 to 12 percent of their revenue as a fee. “I’m pretty happy they’re offering something, given the percentage they’re taking,” said Crystal Bradshaw, who has two listings in Paso Robles, Calif., on the site that she manages with her husband, Justin. (They once hosted me at a different listing in Burbank, Calif.) “At least as a host, I’m getting something back.” “This makes it more attractive to host from Airbnb,” Mr. Bradshaw added. So what are the odds that they or anyone else will ever need to use the insurance? One reason it has taken so long for Airbnb to offer liability coverage is that insurance company actuaries aren’t fond of underwriting anything until they have years of data on death, dismemberment, drownings, compound fractures, crushings and the like.
your-money,Airbnb shared that data with its underwriters (who are making the company pay an unspecified deductible before any coverage kicks in), but the company would not share it with me. “Over 26 million guests have had a safe and positive experience on Airbnb, including over 16 million in 2014 alone,” Jakob Kerr, an Airbnb spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “We respect our hosts’ and guests’ privacy and do not comment on questions like these.” When I responded that disclosing the raw number of accidental deaths and injuries violates no one’s privacy, he said he did not have anything to add. Mr. Wolf, the insurance executive, said that he budgeted for $2 million in liability claims each year on the 7,000 rentals he insured through the Assure product. If each of those is occupied 180 nights each year, that means $1 million in claims for every 630,000 nights of occupancy each year. Guests can feel good about those odds. Busy hosts might be less comfortable. Airbnb, with its 800,000 listings at any given time, has more to worry about. Everyday consumers who neither host nor stay at Airbnb units may think this has nothing to do with them. Chubb, however, sees it differently. If Airbnb succeeds in sharing risk with personal insurance companies, then everyone’s premiums have to rise to cover it. “If you don’t underwrite appropriately, it drives up prices for the average homeowner,” said Christie Alderman, a vice president for Chubb Personal Insurance.
your-money,Insurance companies could solve this by asking all policyholders about their hosting habits, but none of the 10 I contacted said that they had made any changes to their policies as home-renting has grown. They should ask. As for Airbnb’s hosts, they have a few choices. They can simply tell their insurance companies exactly what they’re doing, which is what the insurance companies and Airbnb ask them to do. Mr. Golden of Airbnb said the company did not know what percentage of its hosts were doing so; my educated guess is that it’s a tiny fraction. Or they can buy a vacation home-rental/landlord policy from a company like CBIZ, which offers it on its website. Option 3 is to cross their fingers and hope that Airbnb’s liability backstop will work as advertised. Those who are tempted by this should keep something in mind: The company that now wants hosts to trust it is also the one that built its business by providing a platform for those same hosts to violate all sorts of local ordinances on short-term lodging all over the world. Some of them got into trouble by doing so. When a serious injury or death occurs at a host’s home and the host’s homeowner’s policy denies the claim because of the commercial activity the host was engaged in, will Airbnb be there when the lawsuits start flying? We’re about to find out. And it will be a telling test of just how much the company has truly grown up.
weekinreview,Do Popes Quit? - The New York Times VATICAN CITY — He is elected for life, by a group of elderly men infused with the will of God. People address him as Holy Father, not Mr. President. After bishop of Rome, his second title is vicar of Jesus Christ. Can a man like this quit his job? A smattering of voices suggest that Pope Benedict XVI can, and should, as outrage has built in recent weeks over clerical abuses in the Catholic Church. The calls — from some lay Catholics, bloggers, secular publications like the German magazine Der Spiegel and street protesters — have been fueled by reports that laid blame at his doorstep, citing his response both as a bishop long ago in Germany and as a cardinal heading the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which handles these cases. In the most recent disclosure, on Friday, the news emerged that in 1985, when Benedict was Cardinal Ratzinger, he signed a letter putting off efforts to defrock a convicted child-molesting priest. He cited the priest’s relative youth but also the good of the church. Vatican officials and experts who follow the papacy closely dismiss the idea of stepping down. “There is no objective motive to think in terms of resignation, absolutely no motive,” said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, in an interview before Friday’s disclosure. “It’s a completely unfounded idea.”
weekinreview,Friday’s disclosure is not likely to change that position. The princes of the church — the cardinals who elected Benedict five years ago — have been virulent in their rejection of criticism of the pontiff. Last week, the dean of the cardinals, Angelo Sodano, told the official Vatican daily L’Osservatore Romano that it was not Jesus’ fault that Judas betrayed him and not a bishop’s fault if a priest shamed himself. “And certainly the pontiff is not responsible,” said Cardinal Sodano, who referred to church criticism as “petty gossip” before the pope’s Easter Mass in St. Peter’s Square — although on Friday, the Vatican spokesman adopted a softer tone in a Vatican Radio address. There is a more practical reason why Benedict will most likely remain on the throne of Peter, said Alberto Melloni, a professor of church history and the director of the liberal Catholic John XXIII Foundation for Religious Science in Bologna. Who in the hierarchy would want an ex-pope sitting around, possibly passing judgment on his successor, possibly attracting a rival faction? Mr. Melloni offered another, subtler explanation for why the pope would not be leaving. To resign, paradoxically, the pope has to feel in a strong enough position to say, “Of course, God does not need me; he can drive the church with any other type of driver,” Mr. Melloni said. A pope with that kind of confidence probably wouldn’t need his cardinals to defend him so vigorously, which suggests that Benedict may feel insecure, in Mr. Melloni’s interpretation.
weekinreview,If serious evidence of the pope’s involvement in bad decisions emerges, the cardinals might be inclined to soften in their support. In any case, it is possible that the cardinal electors will take a closer look at the record of candidates on abuse issues for the next election. Most analysts reject the possibility of resignation. “A lot of foreign newspapers are saying it, but the answer is absolutely no,” said Emma Fattorini, a professor of history at the University of Rome. “The church is not a party, a movement, a newspaper, a government.” Of course, popes have resigned before — the last a mere 595 years ago, when Gregory XII stepped down to heal a schism. Before that, Celestine V, a fiercely ascetic former hermit who wore his temporal power heavily, resigned in 1294 (Dante consigned him to hell for cowardice, some interpreters of the “Inferno”believe). While it does not apply to Benedict, another reason for papal resignation was widely discussed in the Vatican in the years before John Paul II’s death in 2005. Several cardinals openly raised the possibility in the event John Paul became too ill to govern. One of those cardinals was Joseph Ratzinger. If John Paul “sees that he absolutely cannot do it anymore, then certainly he will resign,” the cardinal was quoted as saying in the weekly publication of his old archdiocese, back in 2002. Two years later, he gave some insight into his conception of the papacy in an interview with the Italian Catholic weekly Famiglia Cristiana. “The pope is chosen for life because he is a father, and his paternity goes beyond his function,” he said, paraphrasing Pope Paul VI.
weekinreview,John Paul himself entertained thoughts about resigning. In his last will and testament, he wrote, “Providence has seen fit for me to live in the difficult century that is departing into the past, and now in the year in which I reach my 80s, one needs to ask oneself if it is not the time to repeat with the biblical Simeon, ‘Nunc dimittis.’ ” The Latin was a reference to a Gospel passage in which Simeon says, “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.” John Paul was responsible for two recent but fleeting references to papal resignation in official church policy. A revision of the code of canon law issued under him, in 1983, says, “If it happens that the Roman pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.” In John Paul’s 1996 constitution on papal succession, “Universi Dominici Gregis,” he made a reference to “the death or valid resignation of the pope” as he set limits on the College of Cardinals’ actions after either event. In any case, it might be no surprise that the leader of a worldwide church of one billion people would at least think about throwing in the towel. Pius XII reportedly planned to resign if the Nazis invaded the Vatican, and some believed that Paul VI, weighed down by the office, contemplated the idea, according to “101 Questions and Answers on Popes and the Papacy,” by Christopher M. Bellitto, a church historian at Kean University in Union, N.J.
weekinreview,“I think it’s highly unlikely that this pope will resign,” Mr. Bellitto said. “There’s in his mind and the curia’s mind not enough evidence that he did anything wrong. I imagine he thinks, ‘Probably God put me in this position, and it will be up to God to take me out of this position.’ ”
business,Study Finds Sicklier Enrollees in Earliest Stage of Health Law - The New York Times
science,Space Shuttle Landing Postponed - The New York Times CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- For the second day in a row, gusts of nearly 25 miles per hour forced space shuttle Atlantis and its astronauts to keep circling Earth on Monday instead of coming home. The weather was no better at the backup landing site in Southern California, so Mission Control ordered the crew to spend a 13th day in orbit and aim for a Tuesday afternoon touchdown. ``Bottom line is we're waving off,'' Mission Control told commander Kenneth Cockrell. ``We do have three sites for tomorrow, all of them have a 'go' forecast at this time.'' Atlantis and its crew of five undocked from the international space station on Friday, after delivering and installing the $1.4 billion Destiny laboratory, and should have returned to Earth on Sunday. But the crosswind at the landing strip was well above the 17-mph safety limit, a situation that recurred on Monday. Not only that, thick clouds began moving in on Monday and NASA worried they might bring rain. The last time Cockrell flew in space, the mission dragged on for almost 18 days because of landing delays and turned out to be the longest shuttle flight ever. Atlantis astronaut Thomas Jones was also on that 1996 mission. ``The rest of the crew wanted me to pass on that I already have the endurance record,'' Cockrell joked to Mission Control as the weather deteriorated. ``So there's no need to try for that this time.''
science,Mission Control replied: ``We'll do our best to get you back as well before you exceed that 18-day record you've already set.'' Meteorologists expected good weather, finally, at the Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday. The other two options were Edwards Air Force Base in California and White Sands, N.M., as a last resort. A space shuttle has landed only once at White Sands, way back in 1982. Flight director Leroy Cain said he would not consider White Sands ``unless it was the only place that we were able to land in the end game.'' Atlantis and its astronauts has enough fuel, water, air purifiers and other supplies to remain aloft until Wednesday, Cain said. ``The weather is a very tricky thing to deal with, it's not an exact science,'' Cain said. But he promised: ``We'll find a landing site (Tuesday) where we're confident that we can perform a safe landing.'' Until all the landing delays, the mission had gone off without a hitch to the pleasant surprise of both the astronauts and ground controllers. The spectacular sunset launch on Feb. 7 was followed by a flawless linkup with the space station two days later and the eventual installation of the Destiny laboratory. It took three spacewalks and the assistance of the both the shuttle and station crews to install the lab module. After the previous week's hectic pace, the astronauts had little to do Monday except use up their last few rolls of film, exercise on a stationary cycle and wait to come home.
arts/design,A Provocative Museum Places African Art on the Global Stage - The New York Times CAPE TOWN — The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, which opened here last month in a reincarnated grain silo and is drawing around 3,000 visitors a day, appears set to become the dominant arts institution on the continent. It’s already a controversial one, the target of competing and contradictory views. Zeitz Mocaa, as it is known, has been hailed as “Africa’s answer to Tate Modern,”  and “a new chapter in South Africa’s history.” Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in a rare appearance at the opening ceremony, mimed a phone call from former President Nelson Mandela in heaven: “Yes!” Mandela told him. “This is what we were fighting for!” At the same time, art devotees from Africa and abroad have criticized the museum as an elitist emulation of Western institutions, disengaged from local communities. Both views have some validity. The $38 million new museum houses the collection of  Jochen Zeitz, the German-born philanthropist and former chief executive officer of Puma SE, who has been amassing contemporary work from Africa and its diaspora since 2008. The building’s simple concrete exterior and cut-glass-faceted windows give little hint of the spectacular cathedral-like interior, with 80 white-cube galleries over nine floors on either side.
arts/design,Thomas Heatherwick of London, who designed the building, created the ovoid atrium by slicing through 22 of 116 concrete tubes running from the top of the silo to its basement, where conveyor belts once shuttled millions of tons of grain to trains outside. Oliver Wainwright, The Guardian’s critic, described “a thrilling space of concrete cylinders that plunge from the ceiling like carved stalactites, through which stairs spiral and glass elevators glide.” But some question the large sums spent on a private museum while the country’s public museums languish, as well as its location on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in South Africa — the sprawling V & A Waterfront complex of shops and restaurants, much visited by tourists. What they see inside is the representation of one man’s taste in contemporary art — although that man is not Mr. Zeitz. He is Mark Coetzee, the Cape Town-born curator who Mr. Zeitz hired to help him form the collection, and who is now the museum’s chief executive and director. Leading early visitors on a hard-hat tour of Zeitz MOCAA in the spring, Mr. Coetzee explained that its mission is “cutting-edge contemporary, so the work is all made after 2000.” He added that the focus was large-scale and in-depth: “The one rule we made was to buy bodies of work. With very few exceptions, we have 40, 50, 60 pieces of every artist whose work we acquired.”
arts/design,A sampling can be seen in the opening exhibition, “All Things Being Equal,” which is mostly a demonstration of some of the museum’s headliners: Wangechi Mutu (Kenya), Zanele Muholi (South Africa), Chris Ofili (United Kingdom), Glenn Ligon of the United States, and El Anatsui (Ghana) whose bold installations — made from bottle caps, aluminum, copper and other discarded materials of trade — alludes to the scars of Africa’s colonial history. Mr. Coetzee, 53, has also staged early career retrospectives of the Zimbabwean-born artist/activist Kudzanai Chiurai and of the South African artist Nandipha Mntambo, known for her cowhide-covered human figures, molded from her own body. Outside of the white-cube galleries, in the soaring atrium, a giant rubber dragon made from tubing, multicolored ribbons and an animal skull, by the South African Nicholas Hlobo, references Xhosa myth. In the underground tunnels that transported grain, the photographer Edson Chagas has recreated the Angola Pavilion that won the Golden Lion award at the 2013 Venice Biennale. The prominence of photography and video in the collection — Isaac Julien’s nine-screen “Ten Thousand Waves” is also on display — has drawn criticism. Mr. Coetzee said he was aware that there were imbalances, as well as omissions, but that the museum needs time to develop a comprehensive collection
arts/design,Over breakfast recently in London, where Mr. Zeitz lives part of the year, he described meeting Mr. Coetzee in Miami in 2007 when the curator was working for the Rubell Family Collection. Puma SE sponsored Mr. Coetzee’s show, “30 Americans,” featuring work by African-American artists of the last three decades. “We had a pizza together and I asked him why artists from Africa are so little represented, and why there is no significant cultural institution in Africa. I said, why don’t we do it?” A year later they began forming a collection of contemporary African art. “This is not a private collection that I purchased for myself,” said Mr. Zeitz, 54,  who looks more like a rumpled game ranger than a C.E.O. “We collected on a scale that you wouldn’t do privately because we always had the idea there would be a place somewhere in Africa where we would exhibit.” Asked whether he had a budget, Mr. Zeitz laughed. “I had to somehow still be able to pay my bills,” he said. “But no, there was no budget in mind.” The mission, Mr. Coetzee said, was to allow Africans to tell their own story. He acknowledged that there were still large gaps in the collection. “There are countries and areas where there are no art schools, no infrastructure and it’s hard,” he said. He added that another goal was to make the work accessible to people who didn’t usually see art, with free entrance for visitors under 18 and, each Wednesday, for anyone with an African passport.
arts/design,“Our public museums, through no fault of their own — they have no money — have not been accessible to people, even postapartheid,” Mr. Coetzee said. “What we have decided to do is to think very carefully about work that is experiential and evocative and really engages a broad spectrum of society. I do believe it’s possible to do that and still have brilliant work.” Still, the tension between the founders’ philanthropic goals and the corporate reality is palpable. The museum sits in the newly developed Silo District at the Waterfront, which boasts apartment blocks, offices and shops. A luxury hotel (not designed by Mr. Heatherwick) sits above the museum itself. As The Guardian noted, “For an institution that is trying to be open and accessible to all, its upstairs neighbor is a painful reminder of the extreme inequality that still racks this city — a luxury playground for some, an impoverished slum for others — more than two decades after apartheid.” Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz looked at spaces in other parts of Africa for their museum. When David Green, the chief executive of the V & A Waterfront, approached them, “it was actually ready made: They had a building and an architect; we had a collection,” Mr. Coetzee said.
arts/design,Mr. Heatherwick, though not a licensed architect, was well known internationally for the British pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, and his flaming caldron for London’s 2012 Olympics. (Several recent projects, including Pier 55, a $250 million project for Barry Diller along the Hudson River, and the Garden Bridge in London have since flamed out.) He had first visited the silo — unused since 2001 — 10 years ago. “I spent two days crawling through the silo, which had a monumental amount of bird poo,” Mr. Heatherwick, 47, recalled in an interview at his spacious London headquarters near King’s Cross Station. “Nothing came of a development idea the Waterfront had at the time, but I was fascinated by the place.” The hollowed tubes were “rubbish for showing art in,” he noted, but “it was so idiosyncratic, such a spectacular tube-tastic thing, that we felt we shouldn’t knock this building down and land a modern art spaceship.” He added, “It felt like our role should be to amplify the power of that building.” A deal was struck: The V & A Waterfront would provide the building and pay for the renovation and Mr. Heatherwick’s fees. Mr. Zeitz would give his collection as a lifetime loan, and contribute half to the initial costs of staffing and offices. The billionaire, who currently oversees a nonprofit foundation with Richard Branson to support the clean energy economy and the Zeitz Foundation for Intercultural Ecosphere Safety, will also provide an unspecified annual contribution for acquisitions over the next 10 years. The renovation budget of $37.6 million, is high for South Africa, but small compared to new museums internationally.
arts/design,Mr. Coetzee did not disclose the operating budget, but said it would be comparable to “a midsize American museum.” Even before Zeitz Mocaa opened last month, dissenting voices were raised. In a 2015 article in Art Africa magazine, the journalist Matthew Blackman wrote an open letter to Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz, complaining that the collection reflected Mr. Coetzee’s tastes, rather than those of an acquisition committee with rigorous selection criteria. Another worry, he wrote, is the power of the museum to skew the choices made by local galleries, which he suggested “are developing their stables purely to fit the buying habits of ZMocaa.” Joost Bosland, a director of the Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town and Johannesburg, which represents Mr. Hlobo, Penny Siopis and Kemang Wa Lehulere (all are in Zeitz Mocaa’s collection) wrote in an email that while there was a basis of truth to this criticism, it was hard to predict what the new museum’s influence would be on the market for African art until its acquisition budget was known. “However, the best African artists have a deep, global collector base, and it is hard to imagine a single actor determining the direction of their market.” Most artists and gallerists contacted for this article were reluctant to voice their reservations about the museum on record, saying that they had too much at stake. “Artists are criticizing it privately, but saying, how do I get my work into the museum?” said Sue Williamson, a Cape Town-based artist who is currently part of a group show at Axis Gallery in New York.
arts/design,Mr. Coetzee said he and Mr. Zeitz had consulted “extensively” with museum curators around the world while building their collection and had tried to put protocols in place as fast as possible. “We have boards of trustees and advisers, governance boards, 20 curators on staff, and two acquisition committees.” He added, “Do I have influence? I hope so. But I don’t have a final say over what should be bought.” Even where the issues simmer, however, reaction has so far been largely positive. “I put the criticisms down to a very reductive identity politics,” said Ashraf Jamal, the former editor of Art Africa magazine, referring to a tendency for Afro-centric art fairs to emphasize black empowerment rather than focus on the quality of the work. “It’s an international museum, it’s not a provincial or national concern, but people lose sight of that,” Mr. Jamal added. “Right now, the collection needs more painting and more sculpture; it’s dominated by photography and video art, but this is such a young initiative. It’s a major phenomenon globally, and a heartfelt attempt to place the African aesthetic on the global stage.”
sports,ESPN Is Laying Off 150 More Employees - The New York Times ESPN announced Wednesday that it was laying off 150 people, about 2 percent of the sports broadcasting juggernaut’s 8,000 employees. Unlike a round of cuts earlier this year in which ESPN laid off about 100 people, this one was not expected to include prominent on-air personalities. “Today we are informing approximately 150 people at ESPN that their jobs are being eliminated,” the network’s president, John Skipper, said in a memo. "The majority of the jobs eliminated are in studio production, digital content, and technology, and they generally reflect decisions to do less in certain instances and redirect resources.” In April, ESPN laid off several well-known on-air personalities, including the former N.F.L. players Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, and longtime employees like John Clayton and Jayson Stark. In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 people. It has been a trying year for ESPN. Its flagship channel has lost about 1.4 million cable subscribers since last year, costing it tens of millions of dollars in revenue and continuing a trend that has seen the network lose 13 million subscribers over the past five years. ESPN has also frequently found itself in the middle of cultural and political wars. The company updated its social media guidelines, but not before the White House called for the firing of a prominent “SportsCenter” anchor after she called the president a white supremacist on Twitter. And last month the company canceled a partnership with Barstool Sports after facing vociferous internal pushback, largely from female employees.
sports,The network has been searching for ways to cut costs as fans increasingly watch sports video clips on their mobile devices rather than on traditional highlight shows like “SportsCenter.” ESPN is locked into expensive, long-term contracts for programming with sports leagues, so savings must primarily come from a reduced staff. The network does expect to continue hiring in some areas. ESPN is also adapting “SportsCenter” for the digital present and future. A Snapchat version of the show that airs twice each day debuted this month, and on Wednesday ESPN also announced it was eliminating the 7 to 11 p.m. editions of “SportsCenter” that had aired on ESPN News. Skipper, who has led ESPN since 2012, had his contract extended earlier this month. In September, he reshuffled responsibilities of top executives, for the second time this year. In 2018, ESPN will open a new studio in New York City. It will broadcast “Get Up,” a sports version of traditional network morning shows, hosted by Mike Greenberg, as well as a new afternoon opinion show. ESPN will also redesign its smartphone app, and begin selling ESPN Plus, a subscription streaming product that it hopes will attract those who do not currently subscribe to cable.
magazine,The New, New City - Life in an Instant City - Shenzhen, China - Dubai, United Arab Emirates - The New York Times “Don’t tell anyone,” Rem Koolhaas said to me several years ago as we headed down the F.D.R. Drive in New York, “but the 20th-century city is over. It has nothing new to teach us anymore. Our job is simply to maintain it.” Koolhaas’s viewpoint is widely shared by close observers of the evolution of cities. But not even Koolhaas, it seems, was completely prepared for what would come next. In both China and the Persian Gulf, cities comparable in size to New York have sprouted up almost overnight. Only 30 years ago, Shenzhen was a small fishing village of a few thousand people, and Dubai had merely a quarter million people. Today Shenzhen has a population of eight million, and Dubai’s glittering towers, rising out of the desert in disorderly rows, have become playgrounds for wealthy expatriates from Riyadh and Moscow. Long-established cities like Beijing and Guangzhou have more than doubled in size in a few decades, their original outlines swallowed by rings of new development. Built at phenomenal speeds, these generic or instant cities, as they have been called, have no recognizable center, no single identity. It is sometimes hard to think of them as cities at all. Dubai, which lays claim to some of the world’s most expensive private islands, the tallest building and soon the largest theme park, has been derided as an urban tomb where the rich live walled off from the poor migrant workers who serve them. Shenzhen is often criticized as a product of unregulated development, better suited to the speculators that first spurred its growth than to the workers housed in huge complexes of factory-run barracks. Yet for architects these cities have also become vast fields of urban experimentation, on a scale that not even the early Modernists, who first envisioned the city as a field of gleaming towers, could have dreamed of.
magazine,“The old contextual model is not very relevant anymore,” Jesse Reiser, an American architect working in Dubai, told me recently. “What context are we talking about in a city that’s a few decades old? The problem is that we are only beginning to figure out where to go from here.” The sheer number of projects under construction and the corresponding   investment in civic infrastructure — entire networks of new subway systems,   freeways and canals; gargantuan new airports and public parks — can give   the impression that anything is possible in this new world. The scale of these   undertakings recalls the early part of the last century in America, when the   country was confidently pointed toward the future. But it would be unimaginable   in an American city today, where, in the face of shrinking state and city budgets,   expanding a single subway line can seem like a heroic act. “In America,   I could never do work like I do here,” Steven Holl, a New York architect with several large projects in China, recently   told me, referring to his latest complex in Beijing. “We’ve become   too backward-looking. In China, they want to make everything look new. This   is their moment in time. They want to make the 21st century their century. For   some reason, our society wants to make everything old. I think we somehow lost   our nerve.”
magazine,Holl has reason to be exhilarated. His Beijing project, “Linked Hybrid,” is one of the most innovative housing complexes anywhere in the world: eight asymmetrical towers joined by a network of enclosed bridges that create a pedestrian zone in the sky. Yet this exhilaration also comes at a price: only the wealthiest of Beijing’s residents can afford to live here. Climbing to the top of one of Holl’s towers, I looked out through a haze of smog at the acres of luxury-housing towers that surround his own, the kind of alienating subdivisions that are so often cited as a symptom of the city’s unbridled, dehumanizing development. Protected by armed guards, these residential high-rises stood on what was until quite recently a working-class neighborhood, even though the poor quality of their construction makes them seem decades old. Nearby, a new freeway cut through the neighborhood, further disfiguring an area that, however modest, was once bursting with life. “If you take Venturi’s ideas about the city,” Holl said, referring to Robert Venturi’s groundbreaking work, “Learning From Las Vegas,” which called on architects to reconsider the importance of the everyday (strip malls, billboards, storefronts), “and put them in Beijing or Tokyo, they don’t hold any water at all. When you get into this scale, the rules have to be rewritten. The density is so incredible.” Because of this density, cities like Beijing have few of the features we associate with a traditional metropolis. They do not radiate from a historic center as Paris and New York do. Instead, their vast size means that they function primarily as a series of decentralized neighborhoods, something closer in spirit to Los Angeles. The breathtaking speed of their construction means that they usually lack the layers — the mix of architectural styles and intricately related social strata — that give a city its complexity and from which architects have typically drawn inspiration.
magazine,In Dubai, for instance, what might once have been the product of 100 years of urban growth has been compressed into a decade or so. Given such seismic shifts, even the most talented architects can seem to flounder for new models. No one wants to return to the deadly homogeneity associated with Modernism’s tabula rasa planning strategies. The image of Le Corbusier hovering godlike above Paris ready to wipe aside entire districts and replace them with glass towers remains an emblem of Modernism’s attack on the city’s historical fabric. Yet the notion of finding “authenticity” in a sprawling metropolitan area that is barely 30 years old also seems absurd. How do you breathe life into a project at such a scale? How do you instill the fine-grained texture of a healthy community into one that rose overnight? Cities like these, built on a colossal scale, seem to absorb any urban model, no matter how unique, virtually unnoticed. A project that could have a significant impact on the character of, say, New York — like the development plans for ground zero — can seem a mere blip in Beijing, which has embarked on dozens of similarly sized endeavors in the last decade alone. “The irony is that we still don’t know if postmodernism was the end of Modernism or just an interruption,” Koolhaas told me recently. “Was it a brief hiatus, and now we are returning to something that has been going on for a long time, or is it something radically different? We are in a condition we don’t understand yet.”
magazine,For architects faced with building these large urban developments, the   difficulty is to create something where there was nothing. If much of contemporary   architecture   depends on sifting through the cultural and historical layers that a site accumulates   over time — whether neo-Classical monuments or Socialist-era housing —   what can be done if there is nothing to sift through but sand? In a recent design for a six-and-a-half-square-mile development in Dubai called Waterfront City, Koolhaas proposed creating an urban island inspired by a section of Midtown Manhattan. The design linked a dense grid of conventional towers to the mainland by a system of bridges. A series of stunning “iconic” buildings — a gigantic, hollowed-out Piranesian sphere at the island’s edge; a spiraling tower that winds around an airy public atrium — were intended to give the city a distinct flavor. Koolhaas said he hoped, in this way, to infuse this entirely new development with something of the feeling of an older city. But while the outlines are intriguing, he is still coming to terms with how to create an organic whole. In the early stages of the design, Koolhaas experimented with somewhat conventional models of public space: a boardwalk along the island’s perimeter, a narrow park cutting through its center, classical arcades lining the downtown streets. But the majority of Dubai’s inhabitants are foreign-born, and the arcaded streets could easily suggest a theme-park version of a traditional Arab city. Koolhaas is painfully aware of how hard it is to escape the generic.
magazine,“A city like Dubai is literally built on a desert,” Koolhaas conceded when I asked him about the project. “There is a weird alternation between density and emptiness. You rarely feel that you are designing for people who are actually there but for communities that have yet to be assembled. The vernacular is too faint, too precarious to become something on which you can base an architecture.” Koolhaas says he hopes that the plan will gain in complexity as the buildings’ functions are worked out; he says he was thrilled to learn that the government wanted both a courthouse and a mosque on the island. “Another option that I personally find very interesting,” Koolhaas told me, “is the modernist vernacular of the 1970s — buildings that once you put them in Singapore or Dubai take on totally different meanings. Some of the modern typologies work in Asia even though they are totally dysfunctional in America. Typologies we’ve rejected turn out to be viable in other contexts.” The challenges of building what amounts to a small-scale city from scratch   are compounded by the realities of working in a global marketplace. An architect   of Koolhaas’s stature may be grappling simultaneously with the design   of a television headquarters complex in Beijing, a stock exchange in Shenzhen   and a 20-block neighborhood in Dubai, as well as a dozen buildings in Europe.   The intense competition for these commissions means that architects are often   forced to churn out seductive designs in weeks or months, tweaking their models   to fit local conditions.
magazine,Several years ago, the London-based, Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid received a phone call from a Chinese developer asking if she might be interested in designing a 500-acre urban development on the outskirts of Singapore. Hadid had never met the developer before. She was soon working on the master plan for “One North,” a mixed-use development with a projected population of about 140,000. Located on what was once a military site, Hadid’s design conjured a high-tech mountainous terrain. Dubbed the “urban carpet,” it was intended to blend office and residential towers and highways and public parks into a seamless whole. Against the rigid lines of the traditional street grid, the sinuous curves of the freeways suggested a more fluid, mobile society. The rooftops, whose heights were subject to stringent regulations, looked as if they were cut from a single piece of crumpled fabric, giving the composition a haunting unity. “We wanted to create a complex order rather than either the monotony of Modernism or the chaos you find in contemporary cities,” Hadid said. Yet once construction began, the design of the buildings was left to local architects hired by the developer. As the towers rose in clusters scattered across the site, it was difficult to read the formal intent. With more than 20 blocks now complete, parts of the city look surprisingly conventional.
magazine,Hadid revived the concept several years later, when she won a competition to create a 1,360-acre business district in a former industrial zone on the outskirts of Istanbul. This time, the context was more promising: a hilly landscape at the edge of the sea flanked by older working-class neighborhoods on either side. To allow the development to grow in a more natural way than at One North, it would be built in phases that would begin at the waterfront and spread inland, eventually connecting to the street grid of the older neighborhoods. In an effort to preserve the texture of her original concept, Hadid developed a series of building prototypes, including a star-shaped tower and a housing block organized around a central court, and staggered the heights of the buildings to reflect the existing terrain. If Hadid’s plan is formally inventive, it is still unclear whether it has escaped the homogeneity that was a hallmark of Modernist urban-renewal projects. Its sheer size coupled with the fact that the shapes of the buildings were conceived by a single architect means the result may well be more uniform, and ultimately more rigid, than Hadid intended.
magazine,Indeed, contemporary architects’ urban plans may be less tied to location than they would like to admit. When a Chinese developer approached the New York-based Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto to design a 1,235-acre development in Foshan, on the Pearl River Delta, they (with a Chinese partner) came up with a system of urban “mats”: a multilayered network of roads and low-rise commercial spaces, topped by a park surrounded by residential and commercial buildings. The park followed the contours of the roadways below; sunken courtyards allowed light to spill down into the underground spaces. Last year, the Chinese project fell through, and Reiser and Umemoto reworked the idea for a developer in Dubai. The layout was reconfigured to fit the new waterfront site; souks were added as a nod to local traditions. The result is a remarkably nuanced view of how to knit together the various elements of urban life, but it also seems as if it could exist anywhere.
magazine,The walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods celebrated by Jane Jacobs may seem impossibly remote, but encouraging signs of a more   textured urban reality can still be found. Take Holl’s Linked Hybrid in   Beijing, for example, which has a surprisingly open, communal spirit. A series   of massive portals lead from the street to an elaborate internal courtyard garden,   a restaurant, a theater and a kindergarten, integrating the complex into the   surrounding neighborhood. Bridges connect the towers 12 to 19 stories above   ground and are conceived as a continuous string of public zones, with bars and   nightclubs overlooking a glittering view of the city and a suspended swimming   pool. “The developer’s openness to ideas was amazing,” Holl   says. “When they first asked me to do the project, it was just housing.   I suggested adding the cinematheque, the kindergarten. I added an 80-room hotel   and the swimming pool as well. Anywhere else, they’d build it in phases   over several years. It’s too big. After our meeting, they said we’re   building the whole thing all at once. I couldn’t believe it. We haven’t   had to compromise anything. “But what makes it possible is the density. The Modernist idea of the street in the air that became a place of social interaction never worked in Europe. Beijing is so dense that I can keep all of the shops functioning on the street, and there’s still enough energy to activate the bridges as well.”
magazine,Holl is continuing to explore these ideas in another megaproject, this time on the outskirts of Shenzhen: a zigzag-shaped office complex propped up on big steel columns that make room for a dreamy public garden. The density in much of Shenzhen can make Beijing look spacious. The imposing skyline of glass-and-steel towers, plastered with electronic billboards, was built mostly within the last decade, part of the boom that followed foreign investment in the area, when it was declared a special economic zone in the early ’80s. The Chinese government initially allowed many of the small villages that lined the delta to hold on to their land. As land values rose around them, the villagers remained in their increasingly populated districts, where they built cheap, and often instantly decrepit, towers that were so close together they were dubbed “handshake buildings”: you could literally reach out your window and shake hands with your neighbor across the street. The villages are poignant testimonies to the hardships that young workers, recently transplanted from the countryside, face in the new China. Many live packed a half dozen or more in one-bedroom apartments. But if Shenzhen is an emblem of what can happen when free-market capitalism is allowed to run amok, it is also an example of the spontaneous creativity that occurs when people are left to fend for themselves. On a recent visit, the alleyways, dark and claustrophobic, were thick with shops. Elderly people played mah-jongg on card tables in the street; two young children sat at a small desk doing their homework in a tiny storefront that doubled as their bedroom.
magazine,Wenyi Wu, a young architect working for a Chinese firm called Urbanus, led me around the area. The firm has been studying how people carve a living space out of seemingly inhospitable environments, hoping to develop an urbanist model more deeply rooted in the spontaneity of everyday life. He took me to a small museum Urbanus designed on the outskirts of the city. A series of stepped galleries stand at the base of a hill between an urban village and some banal housing complexes above. A series of long ramps pierce the building, joining the two worlds. More ramps encircle the exterior, so that you have the impression of moving through a system of loosely connected alleyways. The idea was to transform the unregulated character of the urban village into something more formal and humane — to extract the essence of its character without romanticizing the squalor. The circuitous paths of the ramps echo the surrounding alleyways; the layout of the galleries suggests the footprint of the migrant workers’ housing but on a more intimate scale. Other architects, hoping to build in ways that reflect an emerging vernacular, are taking a similar approach, looking at more modest and more informally constructed urban neighborhoods for inspiration. Shumon Basar, a London-based critic and independent curator, recently described a number of small, unplanned settlements in and around Dubai. The dense and gritty neighborhood of Deira, for instance, has little in common with Sheikh Zayed Road and its fortified glass towers. Built mainly in the 1970s, Deira’s low concrete structures and labyrinthine alleyways are home to a lively population of Southeast Asian workers. Similarly, the thriving, traditionally Muslim middle-class neighborhoods of Sharjah, the third-largest city in the United Arab Emirates, were built without the flashiness of more recent developments. Basar wonders if, despite their modesty, these areas could form the basis for a fresh urban strategy based neither on imported Western models nor on clichés about local souks.
magazine,As Holl told me recently in his New York office, working on a large scale doesn’t mean that the particulars of place no longer matter. “I don’t think of any of my buildings as a model for something, the way the Modernists did,” Holl said. “If it works, it works in its specific context. You can’t just move it somewhere else.” But is site specificity enough? “The amount of building becomes obscene without a blueprint,” Koolhaas said. “Each time you ask yourself, Do you have the right to do this much work on this scale if you don’t have an opinion about what the world should be like? We really feel that. But is there time for a manifesto? I don’t know.”

sports,N.F.L. Extends Roger Goodell’s Contract, Ending Weeks of Discord - The New York Times The N.F.L. on Wednesday extended the contract of Commissioner Roger Goodell for another five years, ending an unusually rancorous monthslong standoff with Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys’ owner, who wanted to derail the deal. A committee of owners negotiating Goodell’s compensation signed off on a contract worth roughly $200 million over five years, which is in line with his current deal. But unlike his current arrangement, nearly 90 percent of the potential compensation will be paid only if a variety of financial targets are met. The N.F.L. and its commissioner routinely negotiate such matters behind closed doors. But this year, disorder among owners spilled out in public, leading to an extraordinary tit-for-tat of threats of legal action and rebukes that added to the sense of a league anxious over its future. Despite declining television ratings, persistent worries about the safety of the game and a backlash against the league because of players protesting during the national anthem, the league is still a financial juggernaut, with $14 billion in annual revenue. That is a big reason the owners are comfortable keeping Goodell — who became commissioner in 2006 — on for another five years. But with anxiety over the league’s weaknesses growing, Jones and other owners wanted to ensure Goodell continued to focus on growing the league’s business. As a result, they have insisted that most of his compensation in the coming years be based on the N.F.L. hitting financial targets, with various owners signing off on bonuses linked to the targets. Goodell’s guaranteed salary before those potential bonuses will be about $4 million a year.
sports,In a letter sent to every owner on Wednesday, Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the committee, said that Goodell’s contract extension was “fully consistent with ‘market’ compensation” and was “in the best interests of ownership.” Contrary to Jones’s efforts to undermine the deal, Blank said there was nearly a consensus to offer Goodell an extension and to move quickly “to avoid further controversy surrounding this issue.” Jones sparked one of the most bitter intraleague fights in years when he threatened to sue the members of the six-man compensation committee, made up of the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans. The committee had been working since May on the new contract, which would take effect in March 2019. The owners were eager to finish the deal before talks to renegotiate the league’s labor and media deals begin in earnest in the next couple of years. Jones, one of the most powerful and mercurial owners, had other plans. Though he voted along with every other owner in May to extend Goodell’s contract and empower the compensation committee to work out the details, he tried to disrupt the negotiations starting in August, after Goodell suspended Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott for his role in a domestic violence case.
sports,After months of pressuring the committee as an ad hoc member, and lobbying the wider group of owners, Jones in early November told the six committee members that he had drawn up legal papers and would sue them if they did not bend to his will. The unusually caustic showdown that followed, which has led the committee to communicate with Jones only through lawyers, all but ended last week when Jones dropped his threat. Jones has denied that he was trying to upend the contract talks as payback for the suspension. But the timing of his efforts looked more than coincidental. Two days before Elliott’s suspension in mid-August, Jones signed off on the broad outline of Goodell’s new contract, which was based largely on bonuses that Jones wanted as a way to ensure that the commissioner worked hard to raise the league’s revenue. After Elliott was suspended, Jones began to insist that all 32 owners, not just the committee, have a chance to vote on the new contract, because conditions at the league had changed, including a continued decline in television ratings and a widening controversy over players refusing to stand for the national anthem. In October, Jones persuaded some owners that it was best to delay completing the contract to avoid the public spectacle of giving the commissioner a deal worth potentially as much as $200 million while residents in Florida and Texas were still recovering from hurricanes and President Trump was criticizing the league for not forcing players to stand for the anthem.
sports,But after Elliott’s legal appeals to his suspension ran out, and the committee continued to work quietly on the contract extension, Jones told the committee on Nov. 2 that he had hired the high-profile lawyer David Boies and that he was prepared to go to court to stop the negotiations. Faced with potential punishment, Jones dropped his threat to sue just before Thanksgiving. Blank, the Falcons’ owner, said that the committee was within its rights to complete the contract and that the committee members would keep all owners apprised of their work. Almost in defiance of Jones, the committee accelerated talks to finish the contract. After he spent months trying to derail the negotiations, his efforts, in effect, backfired. In uniting to fend off Jones and to allow the compensation committee to finish its negotiations, the owners reinforced the league’s longstanding policy of delegating work and not letting one owner accumulate too much power. “This decision shows that no single owner is more important than the other owners,” Marc Ganis, a consultant to several N.F.L. teams, said. He added that keeping Goodell in the commissioner’s job gives the league stability while it prepares for a new labor deal and negotiations with its broadcast partners.

books/review,Gangs of New York - The New York Times Correction Appended PARADISE ALLEY By Kevin Baker. 676 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95. Until September 2001, three summer days in 1863 were the most frightening in the history of New York City. From Monday, July 13, through Wednesday, July 17, mobs held much of Manhattan. The rioters were working class, overwhelmingly Irish Catholic and filled with smoldering resentments -- at the Yankee Protestants who exploited and demeaned them, at the squalor in which they were forced to live, at inflationary prices and lockouts and strikebreaking. But the final spark was provided by the new National Conscription Act, which made virtually all able-bodied men eligible for the draft but allowed the well-to-do to escape service in the Union Army by paying a $300 fee. As many of the Irish saw it, poor white workingmen like themselves were being forced to fight for the freedom of blacks, who would then come north and take their jobs. They burned federal property and attacked Republican newspaper offices, looted stores and wrecked private homes, killed policemen and soldiers who tried to stop them and beat or butchered any African-American men, women or children who happened to cross their path. A puzzled foreign visitor asked a bystander why blacks were the special targets of their anger. ''Oh, sir,'' the man replied, ''they hate them here'' because ''they are the innocent cause of all these troubles.''
books/review,The New York draft riots remain the worst civil disturbance in American history: according to the historian Adrian Cook, 119 people are known to have been killed, mostly rioters or onlookers who got too close when federal troops, brought back from the battlefield to restore order, started shooting. Those three chaotic days provide the backdrop for Kevin Baker's extraordinary new novel, ''Paradise Alley.'' Baker is simultaneously a richly imaginative fiction writer steeped in historical fact and a meticulous historian who cheerfully alters actual events whenever it serves the intricate, many-sided stories he likes to spin. As the chief historical researcher for Harold Evans, Baker ferreted out a lot of the quirky details that helped fill Evans's best-selling ''American Century'' with so many unexpected pleasures. ''In the News,'' Baker's column in American Heritage magazine, offers readers a bimonthly dose of historical context for current events, shrewdly distinguishing those items for which the past really is prologue from those for which a knowledge of history isn't much help. In his 1999 novel, ''Dreamland,'' he managed both to paint a wholly plausible portrait of immigrant New York around 1910 and to tell a gritty, exuberant tale that blended historic personages (including Sigmund Freud) and a large fictional cast, with two great conflagrations: the blaze that destroyed the Dreamland Amusement Park at Coney Island and the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, which helped to catalyze the American labor movement. The result was irresistible.
books/review,''Paradise Alley'' is just as successful -- and no less ambitious. In ''Dreamland,'' the immigrant protagonists were Jewish and eastern European. In ''Paradise Alley,'' they are Roman Catholic and Irish. But the misery of their surroundings remains the same: they live in the notorious Fourth Ward, where feral pigs snuffle through gutters heaped with filth, a single spigot serves three blocks and people live more densely packed -- 290,000 to the square mile -- than in any other neighborhood on earth. They battle against the same odds, too, and struggle with the same vexing riddle: when does an immigrant become an American? Like a skilled ringmaster, Baker sets seven major characters in motion on the morning of July 13. Most of them occupy derelict houses along the short, fetid block off Cherry Street that gives the book its title. The mob is still just background noise then. ''Something both more and less,'' a member of Baker's cast notes, ''than the daily going to work, the bawdy, boisterous awakening of the City that she liked to listen to every morning from her doorstep before joining it herself.'' But as the story sweeps along -- Baker is a master of momentum -- the distant thunder grows closer and closer until its roar drowns out everything else, a lethal threat to all the people he has made us care about.
books/review,Ruth Dove is an Irish-born ragpicker: married to a runaway slave from South Carolina named Billy Dove, she lives in fear of her former lover, Johnny Dolan -- Dangerous Johnny Dolan -- a sometime bare-knuckle boxer whom the horrors of the potato famine have turned into a murderous sociopath. As the book begins, Ruth learns that after a 14-year forced exile she helped arrange, he has returned to New York bent on revenge. Deirdre Dolan O'Kane, the killer's older sister, is as different from him as she can possibly make herself: a proud, pious ex-domestic, intent on working her way out of poverty, she wants her family to ''live like Americans,'' and has transformed her husband, Tom, from a member of a notorious riverfront gang called the Break O'Day Boys into a sober and reliable wage earner. Now she is frightened that by talking him into volunteering to serve in the celebrated Irish Brigade, the Fighting 69th, she has sent him to his death. Maddy Boyle is a teenage prostitute, kept by the book's only important Protestant character, a self-confessed hack named Herbert Willis Robinson. He works for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and is a keen observer of everything except himself; his reluctance to take his mistress into his home in the guarded sanctuary of Gramercy Park leaves her vulnerable to the mob as it roars into Paradise Alley in search of victims.
books/review,Without ever slowing his novel's pace or letting us lose sight of any of his characters, the author takes the reader on a careering, kaleidoscopic tour of their world. The timorous might think twice before embarking. Baker's itinerary encompasses ravaged Ireland and the carnage at Fredericksburg, as well as New York's lower depths. He takes his readers to a bull-baiting pit, walks them past slaughterhouses and through a Manhattan sewer filled with scuttling rats. And we visit places most New Yorkers know nothing about: Seneca Village, the black squatters' settlement that stood in the center of what is now Central Park till 19th-century gentrification moved uptown and wiped it out; a waterfront dive where, for a nickel, thirsty patrons are welcome to as much rotgut whiskey as they can suck through a rubber hose in 30 seconds; and a Bowery saloon that displays on its bar a jar of pickled ears, bitten off misbehaving customers by the female proprietor. Baker's story is so rich in color and drama that here and there some readers may find their credulity strained. But a random check of several of the sources he obligingly provides shows that while he has often changed names and altered locations to suit the story, many of those scenes that seem least plausible turn out to be the most faithful to the recorded facts: a canny black man did deflect a murderous mob by putting on an impromptu minstrel show; when rioters shouting ''Burn the niggers' nest!'' set fire to the Colored Orphan Asylum on Fifth Avenue, a block north of where the Public Library now stands, it really was a heroic Irish boy who emerged from nowhere to lead the 237 terrified children who lived there to safety in a precinct house; and a family's hairsbreadth escape over the rooftops of burning houses that at first seems to have been snipped from an old-fashioned Saturday afternoon serial turns out to have happened almost precisely as Baker describes it.
books/review,As a convincing portrayal of how things were in our city that terrible summer and as a compelling fictional vision of how things might have been, as well, ''Paradise Alley'' is twice a triumph. Correction: November 3, 2002, Sunday  A review of Kevin Baker's novel ''Paradise Alley'' on Oct. 6 referred incorrectly to the ''three summer days in 1863'' that brought the worst of the New York rioting against the draft for the Civil War. Those days, during which the novel takes place, were Monday, July 13, through Wednesday, July 15, not 17.

sports/football,In Report on Bullying, the Vile and the Gripping - The New York Times My first reaction to reading Ted Wells’s 144-page report on the Miami Dolphins harassment case was that Commissioner Roger Goodell should ensure that Richie Incognito never be allowed to play another down in the N.F.L. Incognito, the Dolphins’ suspended offensive lineman, was the ringleader and catalyst of a reign of terror directed primarily at his teammate Jonathan Martin for two seasons. If Goodell is the law-and-order sheriff he claims to be, Incognito’s career should be over, or at the very least, he should be suspended for a season. Wells’s report paints a graphic and vile portrait of an N.F.L. locker room that may shock even those familiar with the often lowbrow culture of men’s team sports. Incognito appears to have lived an unrepentant football life; he is a serial offender who has had behavioral issues at nearly every level of football he has played. By the time I finished the report, what also became clear is that Martin could use a season away from football to sort through a range of complex emotional issues that have been aggravated, not eased, by the culture of a brutal sport. The question that repeatedly came to my mind as I read the Wells report is, Why didn’t Martin retaliate? Martin wondered why as well. As Wells wrote, “Martin came to view his failure to stand up to his teammates as a personal shortcoming.”
sports/football,Indeed, his ambivalence is at the root of mental health issues that have not been properly dealt with. According to the report, Martin contemplated suicide at least twice in 2013. In each case, he was pushed to the brink by his lack of response to nonstop verbal attacks on his mother and his sister. Some of the most gripping passages in the report had to do with Martin’s wrestling with his upper-middle-class background and blaming it for his failure to deal with his tormentors: Incognito and Mike Pouncey and John Jerry, fellow offensive linemen for the Dolphins. At one point, Martin blamed “mostly the soft schools” he attended in middle and high school. Martin said the private school experience reinforced his self-image as a pushover. In an email to his mother, he said, “I suppose it’s white private school conditioning, turning the other cheek.” Martin’s father, who attended Harvard, acknowledged in a text message that he had “punked out many times” when confronted by whites who used the “N” word. We all have our stories about learning to cope with bullies. My mother responded to my complaints about a bully next door by giving me an impromptu boxing lesson in our kitchen. (Her brothers were boxers.) Her advice to me was to punch Billy Boy in his face the next time he got in mine. All of this may be fascinating, but for the time being the issue before Goodell is how to deal with Incognito and Pouncey and Jerry.
sports/football,Incognito should be barred for at least a season and ordered to seek the help he appears to need desperately. Pouncey and Jerry should be suspended. If you want to clean up the workplace, clean it out. The report suggested that Martin be welcomed back: “A young football player who has the skills to play at the highest level and who also happens to be quiet and reserved should have the opportunity to pursue a career in the N.F.L. without being subjected to harassment from his teammates.” Except that the N.F.L. environment — indeed the highly competitive, highly commercialized landscape of team sports in America — does not lend itself to nurturing athletes with mental health issues. Quite the contrary. One of the dismal takeaways from the report, and from events over the last few weeks, including the incident involving the college basketball player Marcus Smart and an antagonistic fan, is how sport, far from building character, is becoming a major factor in its erosion. Many young people and their parents may believe that a college scholarship and a career in professional athletics are just a touch away. All you need is the right school, the right coach, the right tutors and presto! You will get a shot. Teams and institutions place so much weight on winning and commercial success that players like Incognito, with glaring behavioral issues, are passed along and passed through because they can block or tackle. Sensitive players like Martin are often drawn into a culture they have difficulty negotiating.
sports/football,As Martin wrote to his mother in a text message, “Sometimes I very badly want to quit football, as I feel like it has ‘forced me’ to act a certain way, to hang out with certain people, & prevented me from fully taking advantage of the social and cerebral advantages of college & experiencing new things and meeting new people.” Money notwithstanding, Martin needs a year away from the game — maybe more — to negotiate the complicated mental maze of his young life. In his report, Wells writes of Martin, “His brief experience in the league was derailed by harassment from his teammates, and it would be unfortunate if he did not get the chance to resume playing in an environment that will permit him to reach his full potential as a professional athlete.” That environment may not exist. And perhaps never will.
us,In Darkened Movie Theater, Heroes in Life and in Death - The New York Times AURORA, Colo. — Movie screen superheroes never die. But there were superheroes present in a darkened movie theater at the Town Center at Aurora mall, and some of them did die, like Matthew Robert McQuinn, who threw his body in front of his longtime girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, shielding her from the bullets that took his life. Mr. McQuinn, 27, was one of 12 people who were killed when a gunman opened fire in the theater early Friday, and like many of the other victims, he was young enough to have limitless possibilities ahead of him. He and Ms. Yowler went to see the midnight premiere of the latest installment in the Batman series with her brother, Nick Yowler. He, too, leapt to protect his sister. He pulled her from the theater to safety, escaping uninjured. Jonathan Blunk, 26, a military veteran, died when he saved his girlfriend, Jansen Young. Veronica Moser-Sullivan went to the movie with her mother. She was 6, too young to know much about Batman, too inexperienced to know that in the ferocious uncertainty of life, a movie theater could, without warning, become one of the most dangerous places on earth. Veronica died on the operating table after being wounded during the shooting, her 15-year-old cousin, Katherine Young, said on Saturday. “She was just a radiant, happy little girl,” Katherine said. “She was just so happy. She could brighten anyone’s day.”
us,Katherine said that Veronica, who lived in Denver, had just started swimming and had fallen in love with it. “She was really good at it,” Katherine said. “I taught her to long-board, so she loved doing that too.” Veronica’s mother, Ashley Moser, was also seriously injured. She was shot twice in the abdomen and once in the neck and remained in the hospital, Katherine said. “They were just over for dinner on Tuesday,” she added quietly. Just after midnight, the gunman, armed with a small arsenal of weapons, opened fire in the theater, leaving an additional 58 people injured. By Saturday, officials had identified the 12 who died — 10 at the scene and 2 others later at hospitals. The Aurora theater, much like movie palaces everywhere, is a deeply American place where the bonds of popcorn and a refuge from daily cares unite people from all backgrounds. Mr. McQuinn and Ms. Yowler worked at Target, having moved to Colorado from Ohio to get a fresh start. On Friday morning, Ms. Yowler was shot in the knee, but is recovering in the hospital, said a lawyer who is acting as a spokesman for the families. Mr. Blunk served in the Navy aboard the Nimitz and had always wanted to die a hero, his wife, Chantel Blunk, from whom he was separated, told NBC News. Jansen Young, whose life he saved, said that is exactly what happened.
us,“Jon just took a bullet for me,” she said on the “Today” show. Mr. Blunk moved to Colorado after leaving the service and worked here installing flooring, his father, Randall Blunk, said on Saturday. He had a 4-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. Alex Sullivan was a huge comic book fan who was at the premiere to celebrate his 27th birthday. “Oh man one hour till the movie and its going to be the best BIRTHDAY ever,” he wrote on Twitter shortly before he died. Alexander Boik, 18, known as A.J., graduated this year from Gateway High School, near the mall. He was recalled by a friend, Jakob Bolger, as “a very heartwarming, good-minded person.” “He’s hilarious,” said Mr. Bolger, who added that he had been friends with Mr. Boik since the two were in seventh grade. The first victim to be identified, Jessica Ghawi, 24, had narrowly escaped a mass shooting at the Eaton Center mall in Toronto. An aspiring sports broadcaster, she had written that the experience had convinced her that each moment was precious. In this city of 325,000, where the military has had a strong presence for almost a century, the Batman sequel also drew in men schooled in combat but hoping for a few hours to forget about the business of war. Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer, 27, a Navy cryptologic technician stationed in Aurora since October, died of injuries sustained in the shooting. Staff Sgt. Jesse Childress, 29, from Thornton, Colo., was an Air Force reservist on active duty with the 310th Forces Support Squadron at Buckley Air Force Base, according to Air Force officials.
us,Rebecca Wingo, 32, was a single mother with two daughters, a “lovely young woman,” her friend Gail Riffle said, who took classes at Aurora Community College and attended Mile Hi Church in Lakewood, Colo. Micayla Medek, 23, worked at a Subway sandwich shop and was trying to figure out what to do with her life, her aunt, Jennifer Zakovich, said Saturday. The Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office also released the names of two other victims, Alexander Teves, 24, and Gordon Cowden, 51. Those who did not know the victims or their families mourned them as well. On Friday night, candles appeared across the street from the mall. A sign read: “7/20 — Gone Not Forgotten.” Many who stood around the memorial struggled for words — “shocking,” “horrible,” “unthinkable” — that were ultimately inadequate, their voices faltering with the weight of the events. And the victims’ families, now also bonded in their loss, recalled them with a mixture of love and the numbness of disbelief. Ms. Medek “was her dad’s best friend,” Ms. Zakovich said. “She and her sister were inseparable.” Petty Officer Larimer’s father, Scott Larimer, said his son John grew up as one of five children in Crystal Lake, Ill. “We’re still in shock,” Mr. Larimer said on Saturday. “Unfortunately, in the military you expect him to be in harm’s way, but not in a theater.”

business,Health Officials Expect to Start Vaccine Trials in West Africa as Early as December  - The New York Times Public health authorities said on Friday that they hoped to begin trials of Ebola vaccines in disease-ravaged West Africa as early as December and could know around April whether they were effective, clearing the way for possible mass inoculations to stem the epidemic. “Vaccine is not the magic bullet,” Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny of the World Health Organization said at a news conference in Geneva. “But when ready, they may be a good part of the effort to turn the tide of this epidemic.” Dr. Kieny, assistant director-general for health systems and innovation for the organization, spoke on Friday about the conclusions of a meeting the day before where government officials, drug companies and others discussed how to test and possibly deploy vaccines most effectively. Trials in December would be a month earlier than Dr. Kieny had indicated earlier this week. Manufacturers have committed to having millions of vaccine doses available in 2015, with hundreds of thousands ready halfway through the year, she said. “All previous plans are changing from week to week, and always to a greater involvement and a greater mobilization of all efforts to have more vaccine available more quickly,” Dr. Kieny said. Some health experts say that an effective vaccine might now represent the best hope because it has been difficult to slow the spread of the disease using conventional public health measures like isolating patients and tracing their contacts. Efforts are being made to intensify those conventional methods, however, such as building new treatment centers to handle more patients.
business,Dr. Kieny said a decision to start mass vaccinations later in 2015 would depend on whether one or more vaccines proved safe and effective, whether there would be enough vaccine available and whether that strategy would be necessary. Two experimental vaccines are already being tested for safety in healthy volunteers in the United States and other countries outside the outbreak region. One is being developed by the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline and the other by the Canadian government and NewLink Genetics. At least five other vaccines could begin human testing in early 2015, Dr. Kieny said. If the two most advanced vaccines prove safe in initial testing, trials would begin in Liberia and Sierra Leone to see if the vaccines could actually prevent people from getting Ebola. Dr. Kieny’s announcement provided few details of the trials, which she said were still subject to change. But her comments were consistent with plans discussed Thursday by a United States government official who requested anonymity. Participants in the trials would include health care workers, who are at high risk of getting infected. But a trial in Liberia would likely include others at high risk, such as burial workers or family members caring for those with Ebola. The study in Liberia would randomize volunteers to receive the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, the NewLink vaccine or a vaccine for some other disease — essentially a placebo in terms of preventing Ebola. About 9,000 volunteers would participate in each of the three arms of the study, the federal official said.
business,In the Sierra Leone trial, everyone at a particular site would be offered vaccination. But different centers would receive the vaccines at different times, allowing comparison of disease rates between sites based on when they received the vaccination. In that trial no one would receive a placebo. That trial, being planned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is expected to test the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine but might include others. Dr. Kieny said that at some point there would also be a trial in Guinea, the third of the three countries most affected by the outbreak. Some critics have said it would be unethical to offer health care workers treating Ebola patients a placebo. But others have argued that because it is unknown whether the vaccine works, there is no advantage to getting the vaccine instead of the placebo. Dr. W. Ripley Ballou, who heads the Ebola vaccine effort at GlaxoSmithKline, said that a randomized trial against placebo “gets a definitive answer as quickly as possible” about whether a vaccine is effective, which is in the best interest of the community as a whole. The meeting Thursday also included discussions of how to pay for the trials and possible vaccine deployment. Dr. Kieny said money could come from donor countries like the United States and Britain, from the World Bank and others. She added that there was a “broad understanding that money will not be an issue.”
business,Dr. Kieny said that discussions were also under way about indemnifying vaccine manufacturers, because the vaccines would be deployed with much less than the usual testing. That might be a fund to compensate people who suffer side effects from a vaccine, so manufacturers would not bear that financial risk.
us,In Twist, N. Dakota Tribe Fights to Keep College Nickname - The New York Times GRAND FORKS, N.D. — Sometime soon, the Fighting Sioux of the University of North Dakota were to be no more, another collegiate nickname dropped after being deemed hostile and abusive to American Indians. Except that some members of the Spirit Lake Tribe, one of two groups of Sioux in the state, say they consider the nickname an honor and worry that abandoning it would send them one step closer to obscurity. “When you hear them announce the name at the start of a hockey game, it gives you goose bumps,” said Frank Black Cloud, a tribal member. “They are putting us up on a pinnacle.” And so, in a legal standoff that has turned some preconceptions upside down, North Dakota’s top state lawyers will be in court on Wednesday to oppose members of the Spirit Lake Tribe who have sued to preserve the Fighting Sioux name and logo, an image of an Indian in profile, feathers draping down. The battle here, like some others at the 20 or so institutions urged by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to drop their mascots, names or images, has been painful and drawn out. The University of North Dakota is the only one still sorting the matter out, an N.C.A.A. spokesman said, and it is creating rifts on this campus of 13,000 students, among its web of alumni that run through nearly every realm in North Dakota, and, especially, among American Indians here.
us,All around, harsh new accusations are flying. The members from Spirit Lake behind the lawsuit assert that many of the American Indians opposed to the Fighting Sioux nickname are simply from tribes other than the Sioux, and are jealous of all the recognition. (Opponents call this absurd.) Some against the name claim that the operators of the Ralph Engelstad Arena, the gleaming hockey stadium built by a particularly successful alumnus for more than $100 million — and contains 2,400 images of the logo — are secretly behind the lawsuit, hoping to block the nickname from being abandoned. (False, the Spirit Lake members and hockey stadium officials say.) “Still, to do what they’re doing, you’re more or less selling out,” said Frank Sage, a Navajo and one of about 400 American Indian students at the university and one who says he finds the Fighting Sioux imagery hurtful and harmful. “They’re just being used.” The lawsuit, filed last month by eight members of the Spirit Lake Tribe, is tangled, and grows out of a similarly tangled series of events that began in 2005, when the N.C.A.A. warned the University of North Dakota and 17 other colleges to change their nicknames and mascots if they wished to show the images at N.C.A.A.-controlled championships or to host such events. (Two other institutions were later added, according to the N.C.A.A.) Since then, some colleges changed their logos, others sought and received permission from local tribes to keep them, and a few resolved the matter in other ways.
us,But the University of North Dakota is still at it. The state’s Board of Higher Education and the university sued the N.C.A.A. to preserve the nickname and logo, and in 2007 reached a settlement that let it keep them if the Sioux tribal councils in the state — at Spirit Lake and Standing Rock — agreed to the idea by the end of November 2010. But some university officials said they began worrying that the debate was leading other institutions to avoid competing against them in sports. Robert Kelley, the university’s president, has taken no position on the nickname but said he found himself being asked about it almost constantly — at the supermarket, in meetings of the state’s Congressional delegation — and wanted to ensure that the debate did not eclipse the university’s academic focus. Politics on the reservations have also turned tense. In September, the tribal council in Spirit Lake, 100 miles west of Grand Forks, voted to allow the name. But at Standing Rock, more than 300 miles southwest of here, a past tribal chairman was deeply opposed, and a new chairman brought no clear answer, noting in a letter to state officials this fall that he would prefer an “open dialogue as opposed to a stipulated arrangement under deadline.”
us,By then, the Board of Higher Education, which sets policy for public universities, concluded that it was time to give up. The board voted to prepare to “retire” the nickname if a deal was not struck with Standing Rock by the end of October, but a few days after the deadline, the group from Spirit Lake secured a temporary restraining order against the plan. Patrick R. Morley, a lawyer for the group, argues that the university, under its settlement with the N.C.A.A., must at least wait until next November for an answer from Standing Rock. And some at Spirit Lake argue that they — not students — should have the ultimate say on the matter, while some at the university say the backlash from the debate is showing up here, on campus, not on Indian  land. “We’re talking tears and heartbreak here for our students,” said Linda Neuerburg, assistant director of American Indian Student Services at the university, which has 29 programs for American Indians. Leaders at the American Indian Center held up T-shirts they have collected showing images of Indians and bison (the nickname of the rival North Dakota State University teams) in vulgar poses. They described the insult of people walking on a large logo of the Indian face on the floor of the hockey stadium. But those suing said they were proud of the nickname. “I am full blood and I grew up on this reservation,” said Eunice Davidson, 57, who wore a Fighting Sioux sweatshirt on a recent afternoon. “I have to tell you, I am very, very honored that they would use the name.”
us,On Wednesday, the statewill argue against the Spirit Lake members’ restraining order, raising questions about their legal standing, said  Wayne Stenehjem, North Dakota’s attorney general. This puts him, too, in an unlikely spot: Mr. Stenehjem, an alumnus of the university who, like many other political leaders here, has been supportive of the nickname, filed the initial suit against the N.C.A.A. to protect the name. But if the Board of Higher Education wants to be rid of it now, he said, that is its  authority. Still, Frank Black Cloud, the Spirit Lake member, said an end to the nickname would not soothe relations between white North Dakotans and American Indians. “If you think there are some tensions at the university before, just think what repercussions there will be for Indians then,” Mr. Black Cloud  said. “You are going to kick us back a century.”
sports/golf,Padraig Harrington Beats Daniel Berger in Honda Classic Playoff - The New York Times PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. —  Rory McIlroy was not going head-to-head against Rickie Fowler for the Honda Classic crown in a duel of young, photogenic players that no doubt would have piqued the casual sports fan’s interest in golf. The top-ranked McIlroy missed the cut in the weather-plagued event, and Fowler finished outside the top 40. What the PGA Tour got instead was perhaps better for the long-term health of the game: Daniel Berger versus Padraig Harrington in a duel of the ageless. Harrington’s victory over Berger on Monday on the second playoff hole at the P.G.A. National Champion course could be a boon to the game’s participation numbers. What better advertisement for golf as a lifelong pursuit than the 43-year-old Harrington vanquishing a 21-year-old competitor on the sport’s main stage? Harrington made a par on the 17th, which he had double-bogeyed less than an hour earlier, to win his first tour event since the 2008 P.G.A. Championship. “The great thing about golf is it doesn’t matter how old you are,” Berger said. “It’s just getting the ball in the hole.” Harrington, who entered the final round trailing Ian Poulter by three strokes, birdied the 72nd hole by sinking a 15-foot putt for an even-par 70 to share the lead at six-under 274 with Berger, who erased a nine-stroke deficit with a final-round 64.
sports/golf,Berger, a rookie who grew up in the area and lives a few miles from the course, moved into the lead for the first time all week roughly an hour after signing his scorecard. His rise came in concert with the late-round stumbles of Poulter (74), who hit three balls into the water and tied for third with Paul Casey and Russell Knox at five-under 275, and Patrick Reed (73), who held a share of seventh at three-under 277. Harrington, a three-time major winner who was ranked 297th entering the tournament, won this event 10 years ago for his first PGA Tour title. At the time, a golf career was not on the radar of a 10-year-old Berger. “I wasn’t really much into watching golf,” said Berger, who followed his father, Jay, a former Davis Cup player and captain, into tennis. He played golf on the side until deciding as a teenager that he liked it better because, as he explained, “I like the individuality of it; I like having all the blame put on me and all the success.” Harrington’s sixth tour title came in his 239th start. It was Berger’s best finish in 12 tour starts. Harrington’s considerable advantage in experience negated the advantage the long-hitting Berger enjoyed off the tee. Harrington said he knew his key to winning the playoff was finding a way to survive the first extra hole, the 548-yard, par-5 18th, and then going for broke on the second, the 179-yard, par-3 17th.
sports/golf,Berger had a good look at a birdie on the 18th but stroked it past the cup. Given new life, Harrington hit first on No. 17 and stuck a three-quarter 5-iron to inside four feet. “I definitely felt like I got a second chance coming to the 17th,” Harrington said, “and being first up, I knew I had to hit the shot. I couldn’t afford to bail out.” Berger played too fine a shot, and his ball landed in the water. He described Harrington’s tee shot on 17 as “kind of a dagger in the heart” because he did not expect him to miss the putt. Berger may be too young to remember that in 2012, Harrington endured such a terrible case of the yips that the shortest putts became knee-knocking testers. “When you get things like that, it’s really frustrating, it’s really hard,” Harrington said. “You don’t know what to do. You grind your way through it, and it is a tough thing to get through.” Harrington was 117th in total putting in 2012. The rest of his game was great, he said, but his putting did not click into place until last week’s tournament in Los Angeles. Harrington received a sponsor’s exemption into this tournament and became the first player to take such a gift and spin it into winner’s gold since Lee Westwood at the 2010 FedEx St. Jude Classic.
sports/golf,Before Monday, the only time Harrington had exchanged words with Berger was on the practice green at Pebble Beach last month. Berger was singing to a country song that was playing on the loudspeakers when Harrington walked by and joked, “You can’t be singing out here.” Berger laughed as he told the story. He thinks Harrington was still joking when he added, “After 20 years, you won’t be singing on the putting green.” Harrington, who birdied holes 11 through 14, credited a pep talk from his wife, Caroline, before Monday’s finish with his positive frame of mind on the Champion greens. Every time he stood over a putt, she told him, his mantra should be that there was no one better suited to take it or make it. “I wasn’t confident, but, you know, I wasn’t getting in my way,” Harrington said. His return to the winner’s circle could also be healthy for the game in the long term if it provides a ray of hope for another top player enduring a tough stretch. Tiger Woods has had the chipping yips since returning from back surgery. Woods certainly knows what Harrington meant when he said: “As much as people make assumptions, they see me doing stuff out there and think I’m doing one thing, and I’m usually doing the opposite most of the time. I’m doing the correct stuff. I’m just struggling to do it.”
sports/golf,Harrington added, “I was putting so much pressure on myself to get it right and to live up to my mental focus, say, of 2008, that, you know, I couldn’t live up to it.” Harrington interrupted this year’s youth parade to remind everybody that there is fun after the yips and victories after 40. It could be just the dose of perspective the sport needed.
world/europe,Tillerson Says U.S. Will Punish ‘Crimes Against the Innocents’ Anywhere - The New York Times LUCCA, Italy — Days after President Trump bombed Syria in response to a chemical attack that killed children, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Monday that the United States would punish those “who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world.” The declaration, given at a memorial to a Nazi massacre that killed many children, was among the first efforts by a top official to describe what seems to be a new Trump administration doctrine that encompasses  instinctual and emotional responses to catastrophic world events. Mr. Tillerson’s statement also seemed bound to intensify a growing rift between the Trump administration and Russia, where Mr. Tillerson is headed on Tuesday to confront Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, over the countries’ differences in Syria. There had been some hope that Mr. Tillerson would meet President Vladimir V. Putin. But Russia announced on Monday that Mr. Putin would be unavailable — more signs of the Kremlin’s growing displeasure. Hopes in Russia for an enduring thaw in relations between the two countries, fed by Mr. Trump’s oddly positive comments about Mr. Putin during the campaign, have largely ended. European countries, which had been deeply uneasy with the Trump administration’s more transactional approach to foreign policy and its potential willingness to forgive Mr. Putin’s annexation of Crimea and continued meddling in Ukraine, welcomed the strike on Syria and Mr. Tillerson’s reference to humanitarian issues in guiding strategy.
world/europe,“There is overwhelming support in what the U.S. did,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said on Monday, “signaling that we will not tolerate the barbaric use of chemical weapons.” Foreign ministers from France and Italy have made similar remarks in recent days, with Angelino Alfano of Italy saying that last week’s American military strike contributed to a “renewed harmony” between the United States and Europe. Still, over the weekend, Mr. Tillerson made clear that the United States’ strategic distancing in Syria, which largely involves staying out of the country’s civil war, remained in force. “We’re asking and calling on Bashar al-Assad to cease the use of these weapons,” Mr. Tillerson said on ABC News’s “This Week,” referring to the Syrian president and his chemical weapons. “Other than that, there is no change to our military posture.” Mr. Tillerson was in Italy on Monday for a Group of 7 meeting of foreign ministers. The gathering is intended to set the stage for the G-7 leaders’ summit meeting in Taormina, Italy, at the end of May, which Mr. Trump has announced he will attend in what is likely to be his first foreign trip as president. As a candidate and private citizen, Mr. Trump espoused a transactional approach to foreign affairs that put the economic interests of the United States above all other considerations, including humanitarian ones.
world/europe,“I’m not, and I don’t want to be, the president of the world,” Mr. Trump said last week just hours after the Syrian government dropped sarin gas on Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held territory of Idlib Province. “I’m the president of the United States. And from now on, it’s going to be America first.” But days later, the pictures of women and children gasping for breath and foaming at the mouth as they fought the effects of the brutal nerve agent affected Mr. Trump deeply, leading him to order American warships to fire 59 cruise missiles at the Syrian air base from which United States military officials believe the chemical attack originated. To emphasize the shift from Mr. Trump’s focus on economic nationalism to a foreign policy at least partly defined by humanitarian values, Mr. Tillerson belatedly decided to add to his itinerary here a visit to the memorial at Sant’Anna di Stazzema, a village near Lucca where 560 villagers, including children, were massacred by Nazis during World War II. Joining Mr. Tillerson at the memorial were Mr. Alfano; Federica Mogherini, European Union foreign policy chief; and Susanne Wasum-Rainer, the German ambassador to Italy. After the blaring of trumpets and the laying of a wreath at the memorial, Mr. Tillerson approached a small news media contingent to make a three-sentence declaration whose second sentence was: “We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world.”
world/europe,Mr. Tillerson has said little publicly during his tenure as secretary of state so far, and even his counterparts at summit meetings have said that he was unusually silent. But since the weekend events in Syria, he has been uncharacteristically talkative and assertive. One possible reason for his increasing confidence is the rising influence within the White House of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, whom Mr. Tillerson has taken pains to charm. On Sunday, Mr. Tillerson called Russia “incompetent” for allowing Syria to hold on to chemical weapons, and he accused Russia of trying to influence elections in Europe using the same methods it employed in the United States. Mr. Johnson, the British foreign secretary, also said that Europe supported the Trump administration’s increasingly hard line on Russia, saying that Mr. Putin was “toxifying the reputation of Russia with his continuous association with a guy that has flagrantly poisoned his own people.” One measure of how much Mr. Trump’s airstrike in Syria has upended things in Europe was an announcement on Monday morning by the Italians that they had added an “extraordinary meeting” early Tuesday about Syria that would include the foreign ministers from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — all countries deeply opposed to the Assad government and to Russia’s robust support of the Syrian leader. The topic of defeating the Islamic State, which is largely based in Syria, was already on the agenda here.
upshot,The Steelers Are in Better Playoff Shape Than People Think - The New York Times If the N.F.L. season ended today — as the television announcers often say — the Steelers would not make the playoffs. They’re in the No. 7 position in the A.F.C., and only six teams make the playoffs. To add to its troubles, Pittsburgh has to play the 10-3 Denver Broncos this weekend. But the Steelers’ situation is significantly stronger than most football broadcasters have suggested. To understand why, it helps to use our playoff simulator. It allows you to choose the outcomes of any remaining games and see how those outcomes affect a team’s playoff chances. The simulator shows that the Steelers remain likely to reach the playoffs even if they lose to Denver on Sunday. There are two main reasons for this surprising fact. First, the “if the season ended today” framework can be misleading, and the Steelers are a good case study. Yes, it’s true that the Steelers (at 8-5) trail the Jets and Chiefs (also at 8-5) for the two A.F.C. wild-card spots, because the Jets and the Chiefs win the tiebreakers over the Steelers based on the games that the teams have already played. But if all three teams win their remaining games, the Steelers will vault over the Jets in the tiebreaker procedures. (Pittsburgh’s final three games are against other A.F.C. teams, and intra-conference games are an important part of N.F.L. tiebreakers; see below for the details.) So in some ways, it’s meaningless to say that the Steelers would trail the Jets if the season ended today. The season won’t end today.
upshot,The second reason is that the Jets still face a fairly tough remaining schedule, making it unlikely they will win all three of their final games. In two weeks, they host the Patriots (11-2). In the season’s final week, the Jets travel to Buffalo and face their former coach, Rex Ryan, who no doubt would take solace from knocking them out of the playoffs. If Pittsburgh loses to Denver but then wins its other two remaining games, the Jets need to lose only once to let the Steelers in the playoffs. Bottom line: Forget about those playoff-picture graphics that aired on television this past weekend. The Steelers, unlike the Jets, control their chances. And even a loss to Denver leaves them with a plausible path to the playoffs. If the Steelers can beat Denver — in Pittsburgh, which helps — they will need only to beat the lowly Ravens and Browns to guarantee a wild-card spot. Tiebreaker details: The first wild-card tiebreaker is head-to-head games, but the Steelers and Jets do not play each other this year. The second tiebreaker is intra-conference record, and the Jets are currently 6-4 against other A.F.C. teams while the Steelers are 5-4. But if both teams win their remaining games, they will end the season 8-4 against A.F.C. teams. The third tiebreaker — record against common opponents — would then come into play.
upshot,The Steelers would be 4-1 in the two teams’ common games (beating the Browns twice and the Raiders and the Colts, while losing to the Patriots), while the Jets would be 3-2 (beating the Browns and Colts, losing to the Raiders and splitting with the Patriots in this scenario). As a result, the 11-5 Steelers would rank ahead of the 11-5 Jets. The same would be the case if both teams ended 10-6 — so long as the Steelers beat the Browns. That game — in Cleveland, on the final day of the regular season — actually looks like a more important game for the Steelers than this Sunday’s higher-profile game against the Broncos.
science,Lizards, Too, May Sleep in Stages - The New York Times
business/international,E.U. to End Cellphone Roaming Charges in 2017 - The New York Times LONDON — European officials approved on Tuesday a series of sweeping changes to how mobile and wired Internet service works in the region, pushing through rules that outlaw mobile roaming charges and forbid providers from giving preferences to some types of online traffic. As part of the new rules, which are expected to be officially approved by European governments over the next few months, officials here banned cellphone roaming charges, beginning in 2017, when people travel across the 28-member European Union. The changes also outline how Internet service providers must treat data over their networks, forbidding broadband providers from slowing down any particular service. The changes are part of long-awaited overhauls aimed at improving how Europeans connect to and use mobile services. Lawmakers say they want the new rules to foster greater economic activity in the European Union, which in many ways is still divided by national boundaries. Debate about the new rules, more than two years in the making, has pitted many of the region’s telecommunications operators against consumer groups. To appease both sides, lawmakers here hailed cuts in cellphone roaming charges while allowing companies to potentially charge extra for access to their networks under certain circumstances. Policy makers say the change in roaming fees will allow individuals to use their mobile devices across Europe just as Americans can call, text and use the Internet on their smartphones from California to New York. They also say the new regulations for broadband provide a form of net neutrality, or the concept that all data should be treated equally.
business/international,“Europeans have been calling and waiting for the end of roaming charges, as well as for net neutrality rules,” Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said on Tuesday in a statement. “They have been heard.” Many of the rules approved on Tuesday were opposed vigorously by carriers like Vodafone of Britain and Deutsche Telekom of Germany. They have warned that if their ability to charge extra for international roaming — a major source of revenue — is curtailed, they might not be able to invest in the region’s mobile and broadband infrastructure. Europeans now pay $38 for a monthly cellphone contract, or roughly half of what the typical American pays, according to GSMA, an industry group. Mobile and broadband operators have also lobbied to charge web services for premium access to their networks. Telecom operators appeared to have more success on that front because the rules could allow them to charge content companies like Netflix, the video service, to get their videos to consumers at a higher speed. Such charges are not allowed under the open Internet rules approved by federal regulators in the United States this year. Although policy makers in Europe on Tuesday described the guidelines as a version of net neutrality, consumer groups said the potential ability to charge for faster access was a big loophole. The Internet service rules could still be altered by national regulators or face legal challenges.
business/international,“With rules protecting access to the Internet and others handing over the future of the Internet to telcos, it will be up to courts to decide whose interests prevail,” said Estelle Massé of Access, a consumer group based in Brussels, referring to telecommunications companies. Still, analysts said, the reduction of cellphone roaming charges is likely to have the most immediate effect on consumers. As part of the new rules announced on Tuesday, international cellphone roaming charges will be reduced in April 2016, and then fully banned in June 2017, according to a statement from the European Commission. Beginning on April 30, 2016, telecom operators will not be able to charge more than 5 euro cents, or 5.5 cents, a minute to people with European mobile service who make calls while in other European Union countries. There will also be a maximum charge of 2 euro cents to send text messages and 5 euro cents for every megabyte of data downloaded. “This is a great success for the European Union,” Anrijs Matiss, transportation minister for Latvia, which led the negotiations between the European Commission, the European Parliament and member states, said in a statement. To limit the concerns of mobile wireless providers, European policy makers included a “fair use” policy. The policy is intended to stop individuals from buying an inexpensive cellphone subscription in one European country to use it in another where cellphone costs are higher.
business/international,Partly in anticipation of these rules, a number of the region’s carriers have spent billions of dollars during the last 18 months in a new round of consolidation. The goal is to offer voice, text and Internet mobile services across multiple countries to respond to people’s growing appetite to surf the web on the go. “We share the view that an ambitious reform of the electronic communication rules is needed to boost Europe’s digital economy and job creation potential,” Steven Tas, chairman of the European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association, a trade body, said in a statement on Tuesday. The rules approved on Tuesday come after more than two years of lengthy negotiations during which other overhauls, including how wireless spectrum needed for high-speed mobile services is doled out to companies, were removed from the list. Many national governments balked at those changes, saying that control of domestic airwaves was a national issue, not a European one. Eventually, European governments agreed to a set of pared-down rules with both the European Commission and the European Parliament. European policy makers’ attention has already turned toward new legislation — called the Digital Single Market — that was announced in May and is aimed at creating a Pan-European market from digital services like e-commerce. This next step, which is expected to take years to complete, also involves a number of investigations into the dominant role played by American tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook over how Europeans access the Internet.
business,U.A.W. Contract With Fiat Chrysler Would Give 2nd-Tier Workers Big Raise - The New York Times DETROIT —  The proposed contract between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the United Automobile Workers union includes wage increases that significantly close the gap in pay between veteran workers and entry-level employees. The tentative agreement, reached this week, calls for immediate wage increases for all of Fiat Chrysler’s 36,000 hourly workers in the United States, according to a summary distributed on Friday to union members by the U.A.W. The four-year deal, which is subject to a vote by Fiat Chrysler workers, is particularly lucrative for the company’s large contingent of entry-level workers, who earn $16 to $19 an hour. Dennis Williams, the U.A.W. president, said he expects voting to begin next week and to take several days. If the contract is ratified, the entry-level pay scale will immediately increase to $17 to $24 an hour, based on seniority, and top out at $22 to $25 an hour in 2018. That will shrink the gap with veteran workers, who earn $28 an hour but will get wage increases bringing their pay to just under $30 an hour by the third year of the contract. Mr. Williams said the proposed contract went a long way toward eliminating the gap between long-term employees and workers hired after the two-tier system started in 2007. “You will see that we won tremendous gains,” he told workers in a letter attached to the contract summary.
business,The deal also calls for a $3,000 signing bonus for all workers once the deal is passed, and other bonuses of up to $13,000 if certain quality and productivity targets are met over the life of the contract. One industry specialist said the union needed to narrow the gap in pay to ensure passage of the contract. More than 40 percent of the workers at Fiat Chrysler are entry level, about double the percentage for the work forces at General Motors and Ford Motor. “These are tough, complex negotiations, and the union has to bridge the gap between workers to avoid permanent inequality in the factories,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who has worked with the U.A.W. in the past. The contract is expected to provide a template for deals yet to be negotiated with G.M. and Ford. Union leaders will pick the next target company once a vote is taken at Fiat Chrysler. If the contract is adopted industrywide, it will represent another milestone in Detroit’s comeback from the recession. The previous contract was negotiated in 2011 — two years after G.M. and the former Chrysler Corporation filed for bankruptcy and required government bailouts to survive. Since then, all three of the Detroit car companies have steadily rebuilt sales and profits, benefiting from a surge in demand for new vehicles in the United States.
business,This year, the overall industry is on track to sell about 17 million vehicles in the nation. Profits earned in North America have been particularly strong for G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which have a large share of the market for fast-selling pickups and sport utility vehicles. The big profits prompted Mr. Williams and other union leaders to shoot for big economic gains in the current negotiations. The proposed contract also contains the first step toward large changes in how the Detroit automakers handle spending for health care. Fiat Chrysler and the union agreed to establish a health care cooperative that pools the purchasing of medical care and prescription drugs of Fiat Chrysler’s union members, white-collar workers and a trust for retirees. In the letter to union members, Mr. Williams said the co-op “cuts costs through the savings available from a bigger pool of participants.” He added that the union expected to strike similar arrangements at G.M. and Ford, and then combine the buying power of all three companies. “Health care costs are rising,” he said. “It’s a problem for the company, it’s a problem for us, and it’s a problem for our nation.” Fiat Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, hailed the health care cooperative as an important step. “We have agreed to adopt a comprehensive approach to address rising medical costs,” he said in a memo to employees this week. Over all, Mr. Marchionne said, the contract is beneficial for the company and the U.A.W. “I think the agreement reaffirms that we are working together for the same goals,” he said.
business,Besides winning raises and shrinking the pay gap, the union also secured commitments from Fiat Chrysler to continue investing in the company’s American manufacturing plants. The contract summary said that Fiat Chrysler agreed to invest about $5.3 billion in its United States factories over the four-year contract. “The investments are contingent on the company’s ability to generate sustainable and profitable vehicle volumes,” the union said.
us,Obama Proposes Single Overseer for Food Safety - The New York Times WASHINGTON — To understand America’s fragmented food safety inspection system, consider a slice of frozen pizza. The pepperoni is examined by the Agriculture Department, the cheese and tomato sauce by the Food and Drug Administration, each agency using its own methods for inspecting and testing. If someone gets ill sampling that slice’s tasty goodness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention might sound the alarm, but it would fall to the F.D.A. to pressure the pizza maker for a recall. The Obama administration wants a single new agency to sweep all that away: the Food Safety Administration, a colossus that would be housed within the Department of Health and Human Services to “provide focused, centralized leadership, a primary voice on food safety standards and compliance with those standards,” the administration said in its new budget request. At least 15 government agencies — from the Environmental Protection Agency to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — have some role in making sure the food Americans eat is safe, according to the Government Accountability Office, a situation that has defied streamlining for decades. And the Obama administration’s new push to untangle that web is already running into opposition from some food safety experts, consumer groups and the inspectors who would be most affected. The federal government, they say, does not do well with big.
us,“I’m afraid what we could see is what happened when the Department of Homeland Security was created, and they tried to fit a bunch of different agencies with different missions under one roof,” said Tony Corbo, a lobbyist for Food and Water Watch, an advocacy group. Entrenched bureaucracies have always been difficult to reconcile. The Agriculture Department and the F.D.A., the two main food safety agencies, have for decades carried out different mandates, operated different types of inspections programs, and required different levels of training and education for inspectors. Long-running turf battles between the agencies would inevitably complicate efforts to consolidate them, experts say. But to supporters of the president’s push, the nation’s food safety system is crying out for change. According to the C.D.C., an estimated 48 million Americans are sickened each year by contaminated food, 128,000 are hospitalized with food-related illness and 3,000 die from food-related disease. The federal food safety system is “high-risk” because of “inconsistent oversight, ineffective coordination, and inefficient use of resources,” according to a report by the G.A.O. released last week. “A single food safety agency would ensure one person is held accountable for food safety, research, prevention, inspections, investigations and labeling,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. “There would be no more confusion around overlapping jurisdictions.” Most of the responsibility for food safety lies currently with the F.D.A., which has oversight for about 80 percent of the food that Americans eat, including seafood, vegetables, fruit, dairy products and shelled eggs. The Agriculture Department oversees meat, poultry and processed eggs. But the two agencies perform their inspections duties differently.
us,Inspectors for the Agriculture Department are stationed at processing plants daily, inspecting carcasses as they pass by on processing lines. By law, meat and poultry plants are not allowed to operate unless an Agriculture Department inspector is present. In contrast, because of the sheer volume of food they must inspect, F.D.A. inspectors visit plants much less frequently, often only when there is a problem. The differences in inspecting food from abroad are even more stark. Countries that want to export meat to the United States are supposed to prove their inspection system is equivalent to the Agriculture Department’s programs. But the F.D.A. rarely inspects overseas plants to verify those claims, and F.D.A. food sleuths examine less than 2 percent of the food that arrives at American ports. A law passed in 2010 is supposed to strengthen the F.D.A.’s ability to inspect both foreign and domestic foods. But food safety inspectors at the Agriculture Department still see the F.D.A.’s program as nowhere near as rigorous as theirs, and they worry that consolidating inspection functions into a single agency would inevitably weaken the Agriculture Department’s standards. “This would drag us down to their minuscule standards,” said Stan Painter, an Agriculture food safety inspector in Alabama, who is president of the inspectors’ union. “They don’t do inspections. They run in for a visit.” Dr. David Acheson, a consultant for food and beverage companies who has worked on food safety at both the Agriculture Department and the F.D.A., said the two inspection systems could be combined without harming food safety.
us,“It’s the way we need to go,” he said, shrugging off the meat inspectors’ claims. “We are burning through dollars where we have F.D.A. and Agriculture Department in the same plants doing different things.” For their part, White House officials eschew lofty talk for their food safety proposal, framing it instead in terms of government efficiency. One official said the budget request is the first step in reviving an authority that once enabled the president to reorganize and reform government at will. That power was first conferred on the chief executive during the Great Depression but expired in 1984. White House officials said that the president was seeking to revive that authority to fix what is often a bureaucratic and fragmented federal system. Officials at the Agriculture Department and the F.D.A. declined to say whether they would support a combined agency, adding that they are moving forward with their respective duties as Congress considers the president’s proposal. The House Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture has scheduled a hearing on the Agriculture Department’s budget for next week, but it is unclear if the proposal for a single food safety agency will get much attention. It does have some support. Last month, a bill to create a single food safety agency was introduced by Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, and in the House by Ms. DeLauro. Unlike Mr. Obama’s proposal, their bills would create a stand-alone agency that would not be housed at the Department of Health and Human Services.
us,Such advocates have not won over the skeptics. Doug Powell, a former professor of food safety at Kansas State University and the publisher of the barfblog.com, said creating a single agency might ultimately provide less protection than the administration or lawmakers like Ms. DeLauro want to admit. “The research doesn’t support the idea that a single agency would protect food safety any more than the system U.S. currently has in place,” Mr. Powell said. “Look at the United Kingdom and the horse-meat scandal or Canada, which had a massive beef recall a few years ago. Both of those countries have single food safety agencies, and it didn’t stop contaminated products from reaching the public.”

The release of the video comes after protesters and the family of the youth, Tyrone Harris Jr., raised doubts about the police version of the events that left Mr. Harris critically injured after he was shot at by four plainclothes police detectives. After Mr. Harris raced across West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, where demonstrators were commemorating the first anniversary of the death of Michael Brown, the authorities said, he began firing on an unmarked police vehicle whose lights were flashing. That led to a foot chase, the police said, which ended with Mr. Harris bloodied and facedown in a parking lot. The video’s release comes as an edgy calm took hold in the troubled city. The St. Louis County executive said that he would consider on Wednesday lifting the state of emergency that he declared this week. “I certainly don’t want to see the state of emergency any longer than it needs to be,” the county executive, Steve Stenger, said. “We’re going to see what happens tonight, see how things go. If the situation demonstrates no need, we will pull the state of emergency.”
us,An end to the emergency declaration would allow St. Louis County’s police chief, Jon Belmar, to cede command of law enforcement operations related to protests in Ferguson, the suburb that has been roiled by demonstrations since the Aug. 9, 2014, killing of Mr. Brown, a black teenager, by a white police officer. But Ferguson’s mayor, James W. Knowles III, urged caution. “I wouldn’t want to do anything prematurely, but I also wouldn’t want people to think that the city at large isn’t safe,” Mr. Knowles said. “We’ll have to play it by ear over the next couple days. I don’t want to withdraw too soon and invite more problems back.” Mr. Stenger declared the emergency on Monday, after what the police said was a shootout between officers and Mr. Harris. As Mr. Harris remained hospitalized in critical condition and arrested on felony charges that include assault on a law enforcement officer, St. Louis County investigators took to YouTube to post footage from a surveillance camera in the strip mall where Sunday’s shooting started. The black-and-white clip, only 13 seconds long, shows people milling about before ducking and running behind cars. The man who the police said was Mr. Harris can be seen running toward the storefronts, then turning back toward the street and pulling the weapon. The video does not show the confrontation between Mr. Harris and the detectives. A protest activist, DeRay McKesson, said he still had more questions than answers about what led the police to shoot Mr. Harris.
us,“What I saw on the video was someone with a gun,” Mr. McKesson said. “It’s an open-carry state. So I hope that the presence of a gun doesn’t mean people get shot.” Sunday’s shooting had prompted the authorities to brace for renewed unrest on Monday night. But officers, many in riot gear, faced only intermittent clashes with protesters who gathered on West Florissant Avenue. Twenty-two people were arrested Monday on or near the street, where there have been dozens of tense standoffs since last summer when Mr. Brown’s death spurred wide protests, some of which were violent. Some protesters returned to the street on Tuesday night.
business,TECHNOLOGY; Microsoft Sites Shut, This Time in Network Attack - The New York Times A network attack kept most Internet users out of Microsoft's key Web sites for more than five hours yesterday, a day after an error by one of the company's own technicians closed the sites for nearly 24 hours. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, blamed a denial-of-service attack for crippling half a dozen sites, including its corporate home page at microsoft.com and its popular free e-mail service, Hotmail.com. Also shut down were MSN.com, Expedia.com, Carpoint.com and Encarta.com. The company said its engineers shielded the network from the attack and returned traffic to all Web sites by 3:30 p.m., Pacific time. ''Microsoft has made the F.B.I. aware of this situation and has taken immediate steps to ensure our customers can gain access to our Web sites,'' the company said in a statement late in the day. ''These steps will also make sure that our networks have improved protection from this type of attack.'' Daniel Todd, chief technologist for Keynote Systems of San Mateo, Calif., which monitors Internet performance for Microsoft's Web sites, said the assault was unlike any he had seen before. A typical denial-of-service attack uses a computer program to overwhelm Web sites with thousands of requests for information. But Mr. Todd said this attack was made both against Microsoft Web sites and the infrastructure that supports them. ''It's like the difference between taking someone's phone off the hook, versus cutting the line to their house,'' he said.
business,A person close to the investigation at Microsoft said publicity on the company's Web site woes the day before might have encouraged hackers when Microsoft was vulnerable. Keynote's computers send about 250 requests an hour to Microsoft Web sites and measure their reliability. Usually, the sites respond 99 percent of the time, Mr. Todd said. But around 6 p.m. Tuesday, Pacific time, Keynote's computers detected failures. That night and all Wednesday, he said, reliability dropped to 15 percent for MSN.com and below 2 percent for Microsoft.com. On Wednesday evening, Microsoft announced that a technician had entered incorrect settings for the domain name system server, which converts a name like MSN.com into a numeric Internet address. Microsoft's Web sites had returned to normal levels by 5 p.m. Wednesday. But at 8:45 a.m. yesterday, Keynote noticed another plunge in successful communications with Microsoft's network. Microsoft said its engineers realized that the same server was malfunctioning, but determined this time that the routing system that directs traffic to the company's Web sites was under attack.
us,Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand - The New York Times In the summer of 2005, the Bush administration confronted a fresh wave of criticism over Guantánamo Bay. The detention center had just been branded “the gulag of our times” by Amnesty International, there were new allegations of abuse from United Nations human rights experts and calls were mounting for its closure. The administration’s communications experts responded swiftly. Early one Friday morning, they put a group of retired military officers on one of the jets normally used by Vice President Dick Cheney and flew them to Cuba for a carefully orchestrated tour of Guantánamo. To the public, these men are members of a familiar fraternity, presented tens of thousands of times on television and radio as “military analysts” whose long service has equipped them to give authoritative and unfettered judgments about the most pressing issues of the post-Sept. 11 world. Hidden behind that appearance of objectivity, though, is a Pentagon information apparatus that has used those analysts in a campaign to generate favorable news coverage of the administration’s wartime performance, an examination by The New York Times has found. The effort, which began with the buildup to the Iraq war and continues to this day, has sought to exploit ideological and military allegiances, and also a powerful financial dynamic: Most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air.
us,Those business relationships are hardly ever disclosed to the viewers, and sometimes not even to the networks themselves. But collectively, the men on the plane and several dozen other military analysts represent more than 150 military contractors either as lobbyists, senior executives, board members or consultants. The companies include defense heavyweights, but also scores of smaller companies, all part of a vast assemblage of contractors scrambling for hundreds of billions in military business generated by the administration’s war on terror. It is a furious competition, one in which inside information and easy access to senior officials are highly prized. Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse — an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks. Analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders, including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters, records show. They have been taken on tours of Iraq and given access to classified intelligence. They have been briefed by officials from the White House, State Department and Justice Department, including Mr. Cheney, Alberto R. Gonzales and Stephen J. Hadley. In turn, members of this group have echoed administration talking points, sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated. Some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access.
us,A few expressed regret for participating in what they regarded as an effort to dupe the American public with propaganda dressed as independent military analysis. “It was them saying, ‘We need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you,’ ” Robert S. Bevelacqua, a retired Green Beret and former Fox News analyst, said. Kenneth Allard, a former NBC military analyst who has taught information warfare at the National Defense University, said the campaign amounted to a sophisticated information operation. “This was a coherent, active policy,” he said. As conditions in Iraq deteriorated, Mr. Allard recalled, he saw a yawning gap between what analysts were told in private briefings and what subsequent inquiries and books later revealed. “Night and day,” Mr. Allard said, “I felt we’d been hosed.” The Pentagon defended its relationship with military analysts, saying they had been given only factual information about the war. “The intent and purpose of this is nothing other than an earnest attempt to inform the American people,” Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said. It was, Mr. Whitman added, “a bit incredible” to think retired military officers could be “wound up” and turned into “puppets of the Defense Department.” Many analysts strongly denied that they had either been co-opted or had allowed outside business interests to affect their on-air comments, and some have used their platforms to criticize the conduct of the war. Several, like Jeffrey D. McCausland, a CBS military analyst and defense industry lobbyist, said they kept their networks informed of their outside work and recused themselves from coverage that touched on business interests.
us,“I’m not here representing the administration,” Dr. McCausland said. Some network officials, meanwhile, acknowledged only a limited understanding of their analysts’ interactions with the administration. They said that while they were sensitive to potential conflicts of interest, they did not hold their analysts to the same ethical standards as their news employees regarding outside financial interests. The onus is on their analysts to disclose conflicts, they said. And whatever the contributions of military analysts, they also noted the many network journalists who have covered the war for years in all its complexity. Five years into the Iraq war, most details of the architecture and execution of the Pentagon’s campaign have never been disclosed. But The Times successfully sued the Defense Department to gain access to 8,000 pages of e-mail messages, transcripts and records describing years of private briefings, trips to Iraq and Guantánamo and an extensive Pentagon talking points operation. These records reveal a symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated. Internal Pentagon documents repeatedly refer to the military analysts as “message force multipliers” or “surrogates” who could be counted on to deliver administration “themes and messages” to millions of Americans “in the form of their own opinions.”
us,Though many analysts are paid network consultants, making $500 to $1,000 per appearance, in Pentagon meetings they sometimes spoke as if they were operating behind enemy lines, interviews and transcripts show. Some offered the Pentagon tips on how to outmaneuver the networks, or as one analyst put it to Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary, “the Chris Matthewses and the Wolf Blitzers of the world.” Some warned of planned stories or sent the Pentagon copies of their correspondence with network news executives. Many — although certainly not all — faithfully echoed talking points intended to counter critics. “Good work,” Thomas G. McInerney, a retired Air Force general, consultant and Fox News analyst, wrote to the Pentagon after receiving fresh talking points in late 2006. “We will use it.” Again and again, records show, the administration has enlisted analysts as a rapid reaction force to rebut what it viewed as critical news coverage, some of it by the networks’ own Pentagon correspondents. For example, when news articles revealed that troops in Iraq were dying because of inadequate body armor, a senior Pentagon official wrote to his colleagues: “I think our analysts — properly armed — can push back in that arena.” The documents released by the Pentagon do not show any quid pro quo between commentary and contracts. But some analysts said they had used the special access as a marketing and networking opportunity or as a window into future business possibilities.
us,John C. Garrett is a retired Marine colonel and unpaid analyst for Fox News TV and radio. He is also a lobbyist at Patton Boggs who helps firms win Pentagon contracts, including in Iraq. In promotional materials, he states that as a military analyst he “is privy to weekly access and briefings with the secretary of defense, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other high level policy makers in the administration.” One client told investors that Mr. Garrett’s special access and decades of experience helped him “to know in advance — and in detail — how best to meet the needs” of the Defense Department and other agencies. In interviews Mr. Garrett said there was an inevitable overlap between his dual roles. He said he had gotten “information you just otherwise would not get,” from the briefings and three Pentagon-sponsored trips to Iraq. He also acknowledged using this access and information to identify opportunities for clients. “You can’t help but look for that,” he said, adding, “If you know a capability that would fill a niche or need, you try to fill it. “That’s good for everybody.” At the same time, in e-mail messages to the Pentagon, Mr. Garrett displayed an eagerness to be supportive with his television and radio commentary. “Please let me know if you have any specific points you want covered or that you would prefer to downplay,” he wrote in January 2007, before President Bush went on TV to describe the surge strategy in Iraq.
us,Conversely, the administration has demonstrated that there is a price for sustained criticism, many analysts said. “You’ll lose all access,” Dr. McCausland said. With a majority of Americans calling the war a mistake despite all administration attempts to sway public opinion, the Pentagon has focused in the last couple of years on cultivating in particular military analysts frequently seen and heard in conservative news outlets, records and interviews show. Some of these analysts were on the mission to Cuba on June 24, 2005 — the first of six such Guantánamo trips — which was designed to mobilize analysts against the growing perception of Guantánamo as an international symbol of inhumane treatment. On the flight to Cuba, for much of the day at Guantánamo and on the flight home that night, Pentagon officials briefed the 10 or so analysts on their key messages — how much had been spent improving the facility, the abuse endured by guards, the extensive rights afforded detainees. The results came quickly. The analysts went on TV and radio, decrying Amnesty International, criticizing calls to close the facility and asserting that all detainees were treated humanely. “The impressions that you’re getting from the media and from the various pronouncements being made by people who have not been here in my opinion are totally false,” Donald W. Shepperd, a retired Air Force general, reported live on CNN by phone from Guantánamo that same afternoon.
us,The next morning, Montgomery Meigs, a retired Army general and NBC analyst, appeared on “Today.” “There’s been over $100 million of new construction,” he reported. “The place is very professionally run.” Within days, transcripts of the analysts’ appearances were circulated to senior White House and Pentagon officials, cited as evidence of progress in the battle for hearts and minds at home. Charting the Campaign By early 2002, detailed planning for a possible Iraq invasion was under way, yet an obstacle loomed. Many Americans, polls showed, were uneasy about invading a country with no clear connection to the Sept. 11 attacks. Pentagon and White House officials believed the military analysts could play a crucial role in helping overcome this resistance. Torie Clarke, the former public relations executive who oversaw the Pentagon’s dealings with the analysts as assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, had come to her job with distinct ideas about achieving what she called “information dominance.” In a spin-saturated news culture, she argued, opinion is swayed most by voices perceived as authoritative and utterly independent. And so even before Sept. 11, she built a system within the Pentagon to recruit “key influentials” — movers and shakers from all walks who with the proper ministrations might be counted on to generate support for Mr. Rumsfeld’s priorities. In the months after Sept. 11, as every network rushed to retain its own all-star squad of retired military officers, Ms. Clarke and her staff sensed a new opportunity. To Ms. Clarke’s team, the military analysts were the ultimate “key influential” — authoritative, most of them decorated war heroes, all reaching mass audiences.
us,The analysts, they noticed, often got more airtime than network reporters, and they were not merely explaining the capabilities of Apache helicopters. They were framing how viewers ought to interpret events. What is more, while the analysts were in the news media, they were not of the news media. They were military men, many of them ideologically in sync with the administration’s neoconservative brain trust, many of them important players in a military industry anticipating large budget increases to pay for an Iraq war. Even analysts with no defense industry ties, and no fondness for the administration, were reluctant to be critical of military leaders, many of whom were friends. “It is very hard for me to criticize the United States Army,” said William L. Nash, a retired Army general and ABC analyst. “It is my life.” Other administrations had made sporadic, small-scale attempts to build relationships with the occasional military analyst. But these were trifling compared with what Ms. Clarke’s team had in mind. Don Meyer, an aide to Ms. Clarke, said a strategic decision was made in 2002 to make the analysts the main focus of the public relations push to construct a case for war. Journalists were secondary. “We didn’t want to rely on them to be our primary vehicle to get information out,” Mr. Meyer said.
us,The Pentagon’s regular press office would be kept separate from the military analysts. The analysts would instead be catered to by a small group of political appointees, with the point person being Brent T. Krueger, another senior aide to Ms. Clarke. The decision recalled other administration tactics that subverted traditional journalism. Federal agencies, for example, have paid columnists to write favorably about the administration. They have distributed to local TV stations hundreds of fake news segments with fawning accounts of administration accomplishments. The Pentagon itself has made covert payments to Iraqi newspapers to publish coalition propaganda. Rather than complain about the “media filter,” each of these techniques simply converted the filter into an amplifier. This time, Mr. Krueger said, the military analysts would in effect be “writing the op-ed” for the war. Assembling the Team From the start, interviews show, the White House took a keen interest in which analysts had been identified by the Pentagon, requesting lists of potential recruits, and suggesting names. Ms. Clarke’s team wrote summaries describing their backgrounds, business affiliations and where they stood on the war. “Rumsfeld ultimately cleared off on all invitees,” said Mr. Krueger, who left the Pentagon in 2004. (Through a spokesman, Mr. Rumsfeld declined to comment for this article.)
us,Over time, the Pentagon recruited more than 75 retired officers, although some participated only briefly or sporadically. The largest contingent was affiliated with Fox News, followed by NBC and CNN, the other networks with 24-hour cable outlets. But analysts from CBS and ABC were included, too. Some recruits, though not on any network payroll, were influential in other ways — either because they were sought out by radio hosts, or because they often published op-ed articles or were quoted in magazines, Web sites and newspapers. At least nine of them have written op-ed articles for The Times. The group was heavily represented by men involved in the business of helping companies win military contracts. Several held senior positions with contractors that gave them direct responsibility for winning new Pentagon business. James Marks, a retired Army general and analyst for CNN from 2004 to 2007, pursued military and intelligence contracts as a senior executive with McNeil Technologies. Still others held board positions with military firms that gave them responsibility for government business. General McInerney, the Fox analyst, for example, sits on the boards of several military contractors, including Nortel Government Solutions, a supplier of communication networks. Several were defense industry lobbyists, such as Dr. McCausland, who works at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a major lobbying firm where he is director of a national security team that represents several military contractors. “We offer clients access to key decision makers,” Dr. McCausland’s team promised on the firm’s Web site.
us,Dr. McCausland was not the only analyst making this pledge. Another was Joseph W. Ralston, a retired Air Force general. Soon after signing on with CBS, General Ralston was named vice chairman of the Cohen Group, a consulting firm headed by a former defense secretary, William Cohen, himself now a “world affairs” analyst for CNN. “The Cohen Group knows that getting to ‘yes’ in the aerospace and defense market — whether in the United States or abroad — requires that companies have a thorough, up-to-date understanding of the thinking of government decision makers,” the company tells prospective clients on its Web site. There were also ideological ties. Two of NBC’s most prominent analysts, Barry R. McCaffrey and the late Wayne A. Downing, were on the advisory board of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, an advocacy group created with White House encouragement in 2002 to help make the case for ousting Saddam Hussein. Both men also had their own consulting firms and sat on the boards of major military contractors. Many also shared with Mr. Bush’s national security team a belief that pessimistic war coverage broke the nation’s will to win in Vietnam, and there was a mutual resolve not to let that happen with this war. This was a major theme, for example, with Paul E. Vallely, a Fox News analyst from 2001 to 2007. A retired Army general who had specialized in psychological warfare, Mr. Vallely co-authored a paper in 1980 that accused American news organizations of failing to defend the nation from “enemy” propaganda during Vietnam.
us,“We lost the war — not because we were outfought, but because we were out Psyoped,” he wrote. He urged a radically new approach to psychological operations in future wars — taking aim at not just foreign adversaries but domestic audiences, too. He called his approach “MindWar” — using network TV and radio to “strengthen our national will to victory.” The Selling of the War From their earliest sessions with the military analysts, Mr. Rumsfeld and his aides spoke as if they were all part of the same team. In interviews, participants described a powerfully seductive environment — the uniformed escorts to Mr. Rumsfeld’s private conference room, the best government china laid out, the embossed name cards, the blizzard of PowerPoints, the solicitations of advice and counsel, the appeals to duty and country, the warm thank you notes from the secretary himself. “Oh, you have no idea,” Mr. Allard said, describing the effect. “You’re back. They listen to you. They listen to what you say on TV.” It was, he said, “psyops on steroids” — a nuanced exercise in influence through flattery and proximity. “It’s not like it’s, ‘We’ll pay you $500 to get our story out,’ ” he said. “It’s more subtle.” The access came with a condition. Participants were instructed not to quote their briefers directly or otherwise describe their contacts with the Pentagon.
us,In the fall and winter leading up to the invasion, the Pentagon armed its analysts with talking points portraying Iraq as an urgent threat. The basic case became a familiar mantra: Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons, was developing nuclear weapons, and might one day slip some to Al Qaeda; an invasion would be a relatively quick and inexpensive “war of liberation.” At the Pentagon, members of Ms. Clarke’s staff marveled at the way the analysts seamlessly incorporated material from talking points and briefings as if it was their own. “You could see that they were messaging,” Mr. Krueger said. “You could see they were taking verbatim what the secretary was saying or what the technical specialists were saying. And they were saying it over and over and over.” Some days, he added, “We were able to click on every single station and every one of our folks were up there delivering our message. You’d look at them and say, ‘This is working.’ ” On April 12, 2003, with major combat almost over, Mr. Rumsfeld drafted a memorandum to Ms. Clarke. “Let’s think about having some of the folks who did such a good job as talking heads in after this thing is over,” he wrote. By summer, though, the first signs of the insurgency had emerged. Reports from journalists based in Baghdad were increasingly suffused with the imagery of mayhem. The Pentagon did not have to search far for a counterweight.
us,It was time, an internal Pentagon strategy memorandum urged, to “re-energize surrogates and message-force multipliers,” starting with the military analysts. The memorandum led to a proposal to take analysts on a tour of Iraq in September 2003, timed to help overcome the sticker shock from Mr. Bush’s request for $87 billion in emergency war financing. The group included four analysts from Fox News, one each from CNN and ABC, and several research-group luminaries whose opinion articles appear regularly in the nation’s op-ed pages. The trip invitation promised a look at “the real situation on the ground in Iraq.” The situation, as described in scores of books, was deteriorating. L. Paul Bremer III, then the American viceroy in Iraq, wrote in his memoir, “My Year in Iraq,” that he had privately warned the White House that the United States had “about half the number of soldiers we needed here.” “We’re up against a growing and sophisticated threat,” Mr. Bremer recalled telling the president during a private White House dinner. That dinner took place on Sept. 24, while the analysts were touring Iraq. Yet these harsh realities were elided, or flatly contradicted, during the official presentations for the analysts, records show. The itinerary, scripted to the minute, featured brief visits to a model school, a few refurbished government buildings, a center for women’s rights, a mass grave and even the gardens of Babylon.
us,Mostly the analysts attended briefings. These sessions, records show, spooled out an alternative narrative, depicting an Iraq bursting with political and economic energy, its security forces blossoming. On the crucial question of troop levels, the briefings echoed the White House line: No reinforcements were needed. The “growing and sophisticated threat” described by Mr. Bremer was instead depicted as degraded, isolated and on the run. “We’re winning,” a briefing document proclaimed. One trip participant, General Nash of ABC, said some briefings were so clearly “artificial” that he joked to another group member that they were on “the George Romney memorial trip to Iraq,” a reference to Mr. Romney’s infamous claim that American officials had “brainwashed” him into supporting the Vietnam War during a tour there in 1965, while he was governor of Michigan. But if the trip pounded the message of progress, it also represented a business opportunity: direct access to the most senior civilian and military leaders in Iraq and Kuwait, including many with a say in how the president’s $87 billion would be spent. It also was a chance to gather inside information about the most pressing needs confronting the American mission: the acute shortages of “up-armored” Humvees; the billions to be spent building military bases; the urgent need for interpreters; and the ambitious plans to train Iraq’s security forces. Information and access of this nature had undeniable value for trip participants like William V. Cowan and Carlton A. Sherwood.
us,Mr. Cowan, a Fox analyst and retired Marine colonel, was the chief executive of a new military firm, the wvc3 Group. Mr. Sherwood was its executive vice president. At the time, the company was seeking contracts worth tens of millions to supply body armor and counterintelligence services in Iraq. In addition, wvc3 Group had a written agreement to use its influence and connections to help tribal leaders in Al Anbar Province win reconstruction contracts from the coalition. “Those sheiks wanted access to the C.P.A.,” Mr. Cowan recalled in an interview, referring to the Coalition Provisional Authority. Mr. Cowan said he pleaded their cause during the trip. “I tried to push hard with some of Bremer’s people to engage these people of Al Anbar,” he said. Back in Washington, Pentagon officials kept a nervous eye on how the trip translated on the airwaves. Uncomfortable facts had bubbled up during the trip. One briefer, for example, mentioned that the Army was resorting to packing inadequately armored Humvees with sandbags and Kevlar blankets. Descriptions of the Iraqi security forces were withering. “They can’t shoot, but then again, they don’t,” one officer told them, according to one participant’s notes. “I saw immediately in 2003 that things were going south,” General Vallely, one of the Fox analysts on the trip, recalled in an interview with The Times. The Pentagon, though, need not have worried. “You can’t believe the progress,” General Vallely told Alan Colmes of Fox News upon his return. He predicted the insurgency would be “down to a few numbers” within months.
us,“We could not be more excited, more pleased,” Mr. Cowan told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News. There was barely a word about armor shortages or corrupt Iraqi security forces. And on the key strategic question of the moment — whether to send more troops — the analysts were unanimous. “I am so much against adding more troops,” General Shepperd said on CNN. Access and Influence Inside the Pentagon and at the White House, the trip was viewed as a masterpiece in the management of perceptions, not least because it gave fuel to complaints that “mainstream” journalists were ignoring the good news in Iraq. “We’re hitting a home run on this trip,” a senior Pentagon official wrote in an e-mail message to Richard B. Myers and Peter Pace, then chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its success only intensified the Pentagon’s campaign. The pace of briefings accelerated. More trips were organized. Eventually the effort involved officials from Washington to Baghdad to Kabul to Guantánamo and back to Tampa, Fla., the headquarters of United States Central Command. The scale reflected strong support from the top. When officials in Iraq were slow to organize another trip for analysts, a Pentagon official fired off an e-mail message warning that the trips “have the highest levels of visibility” at the White House and urging them to get moving before Lawrence Di Rita, one of Mr. Rumsfeld’s closest aides, “picks up the phone and starts calling the 4-stars.”
us,Mr. Di Rita, no longer at the Defense Department, said in an interview that a “conscious decision” was made to rely on the military analysts to counteract “the increasingly negative view of the war” coming from journalists in Iraq. The analysts, he said, generally had “a more supportive view” of the administration and the war, and the combination of their TV platforms and military cachet made them ideal for rebutting critical coverage of issues like troop morale, treatment of detainees, inadequate equipment or poorly trained Iraqi security forces. “On those issues, they were more likely to be seen as credible spokesmen,” he said. For analysts with military industry ties, the attention brought access to a widening circle of influential officials beyond the contacts they had accumulated over the course of their careers. Charles T. Nash, a Fox military analyst and retired Navy captain, is a consultant who helps small companies break into the military market. Suddenly, he had entree to a host of senior military leaders, many of whom he had never met. It was, he said, like being embedded with the Pentagon leadership. “You start to recognize what’s most important to them,” he said, adding, “There’s nothing like seeing stuff firsthand.” Some Pentagon officials said they were well aware that some analysts viewed their special access as a business advantage. “Of course we realized that,” Mr. Krueger said. “We weren’t naïve about that.”
us,They also understood the financial relationship between the networks and their analysts. Many analysts were being paid by the “hit,” the number of times they appeared on TV. The more an analyst could boast of fresh inside information from high-level Pentagon “sources,” the more hits he could expect. The more hits, the greater his potential influence in the military marketplace, where several analysts prominently advertised their network roles. “They have taken lobbying and the search for contracts to a far higher level,” Mr. Krueger said. “This has been highly honed.” Mr. Di Rita, though, said it never occurred to him that analysts might use their access to curry favor. Nor, he said, did the Pentagon try to exploit this dynamic. “That’s not something that ever crossed my mind,” he said. In any event, he argued, the analysts and the networks were the ones responsible for any ethical complications. “We assume they know where the lines are,” he said. The analysts met personally with Mr. Rumsfeld at least 18 times, records show, but that was just the beginning. They had dozens more sessions with the most senior members of his brain trust and access to officials responsible for managing the billions being spent in Iraq. Other groups of “key influentials” had meetings, but not nearly as often as the analysts.
us,An internal memorandum in 2005 helped explain why. The memorandum, written by a Pentagon official who had accompanied analysts to Iraq, said that based on her observations during the trip, the analysts “are having a greater impact” on network coverage of the military. “They have now become the go-to guys not only on breaking stories, but they influence the views on issues,” she wrote. Other branches of the administration also began to make use of the analysts. Mr. Gonzales, then the attorney general, met with them soon after news leaked that the government was wiretapping terrorism suspects in the United States without warrants, Pentagon records show. When David H. Petraeus was appointed the commanding general in Iraq in January 2007, one of his early acts was to meet with the analysts. “We knew we had extraordinary access,” said Timur J. Eads, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and Fox analyst who is vice president of government relations for Blackbird Technologies, a fast-growing military contractor. Like several other analysts, Mr. Eads said he had at times held his tongue on television for fear that “some four-star could call up and say, ‘Kill that contract.’ ” For example, he believed Pentagon officials misled the analysts about the progress of Iraq’s security forces. “I know a snow job when I see one,” he said. He did not share this on TV. “Human nature,” he explained, though he noted other instances when he was critical.
us,Some analysts said that even before the war started, they privately had questions about the justification for the invasion, but were careful not to express them on air. Mr. Bevelacqua, then a Fox analyst, was among those invited to a briefing in early 2003 about Iraq’s purported stockpiles of illicit weapons. He recalled asking the briefer whether the United States had “smoking gun” proof. “ ‘We don’t have any hard evidence,’ ” Mr. Bevelacqua recalled the briefer replying. He said he and other analysts were alarmed by this concession. “We are looking at ourselves saying, ‘What are we doing?’ ” Another analyst, Robert L. Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who works in the Pentagon for a military contractor, attended the same briefing and recalled feeling “very disappointed” after being shown satellite photographs purporting to show bunkers associated with a hidden weapons program. Mr. Maginnis said he concluded that the analysts were being “manipulated” to convey a false sense of certainty about the evidence of the weapons. Yet he and Mr. Bevelacqua and the other analysts who attended the briefing did not share any misgivings with the American public. Mr. Bevelacqua and another Fox analyst, Mr. Cowan, had formed the wvc3 Group, and hoped to win military and national security contracts. “There’s no way I was going to go down that road and get completely torn apart,” Mr. Bevelacqua said. “You’re talking about fighting a huge machine.”
us,Some e-mail messages between the Pentagon and the analysts reveal an implicit trade of privileged access for favorable coverage. Robert H. Scales Jr., a retired Army general and analyst for Fox News and National Public Radio whose consulting company advises several military firms on weapons and tactics used in Iraq, wanted the Pentagon to approve high-level briefings for him inside Iraq in 2006. “Recall the stuff I did after my last visit,” he wrote. “I will do the same this time.” Pentagon Keeps Tabs As it happened, the analysts’ news media appearances were being closely monitored. The Pentagon paid a private contractor, Omnitec Solutions, hundreds of thousands of dollars to scour databases for any trace of the analysts, be it a segment on “The O’Reilly Factor” or an interview with The Daily Inter Lake in Montana, circulation 20,000. Omnitec evaluated their appearances using the same tools as corporate branding experts. One report, assessing the impact of several trips to Iraq in 2005, offered example after example of analysts echoing Pentagon themes on all the networks. “Commentary from all three Iraq trips was extremely positive over all,” the report concluded. In interviews, several analysts reacted with dismay when told they were described as reliable “surrogates” in Pentagon documents. And some asserted that their Pentagon sessions were, as David L. Grange, a retired Army general and CNN analyst put it, “just upfront information,” while others pointed out, accurately, that they did not always agree with the administration or each other. “None of us drink the Kool-Aid,” General Scales said.
us,Likewise, several also denied using their special access for business gain. “Not related at all,” General Shepperd said, pointing out that many in the Pentagon held CNN “in the lowest esteem.” Still, even the mildest of criticism could draw a challenge. Several analysts told of fielding telephone calls from displeased defense officials only minutes after being on the air. On Aug. 3, 2005, 14 marines died in Iraq. That day, Mr. Cowan, who said he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with the “twisted version of reality” being pushed on analysts in briefings, called the Pentagon to give “a heads-up” that some of his comments on Fox “may not all be friendly,” Pentagon records show. Mr. Rumsfeld’s senior aides quickly arranged a private briefing for him, yet when he told Bill O’Reilly that the United States was “not on a good glide path right now” in Iraq, the repercussions were swift. Mr. Cowan said he was “precipitously fired from the analysts group” for this appearance. The Pentagon, he wrote in an e-mail message, “simply didn’t like the fact that I wasn’t carrying their water.” The next day James T. Conway, then director of operations for the Joint Chiefs, presided over another conference call with analysts. He urged them, a transcript shows, not to let the marines’ deaths further erode support for the war. “The strategic target remains our population,” General Conway said. “We can lose people day in and day out, but they’re never going to beat our military. What they can and will do if they can is strip away our support. And you guys can help us not let that happen.”
us,“General, I just made that point on the air,” an analyst replied. “Let’s work it together, guys,” General Conway urged. The Generals’ Revolt The full dimensions of this mutual embrace were perhaps never clearer than in April 2006, after several of Mr. Rumsfeld’s former generals — none of them network military analysts — went public with devastating critiques of his wartime performance. Some called for his resignation. On Friday, April 14, with what came to be called the “Generals’ Revolt” dominating headlines, Mr. Rumsfeld instructed aides to summon military analysts to a meeting with him early the next week, records show. When an aide urged a short delay to “give our big guys on the West Coast a little more time to buy a ticket and get here,” Mr. Rumsfeld’s office insisted that “the boss” wanted the meeting fast “for impact on the current story.” That same day, Pentagon officials helped two Fox analysts, General McInerney and General Vallely, write an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal defending Mr. Rumsfeld. “Starting to write it now,” General Vallely wrote to the Pentagon that afternoon. “Any input for the article,” he added a little later, “will be much appreciated.” Mr. Rumsfeld’s office quickly forwarded talking points and statistics to rebut the notion of a spreading revolt. “Vallely is going to use the numbers,” a Pentagon official reported that afternoon.
us,The standard secrecy notwithstanding, plans for this session leaked, producing a front-page story in The Times that Sunday. In damage-control mode, Pentagon officials scrambled to present the meeting as routine and directed that communications with analysts be kept “very formal,” records show. “This is very, very sensitive now,” a Pentagon official warned subordinates. On Tuesday, April 18, some 17 analysts assembled at the Pentagon with Mr. Rumsfeld and General Pace, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. A transcript of that session, never before disclosed, shows a shared determination to marginalize war critics and revive public support for the war. “I’m an old intel guy,” said one analyst. (The transcript omits speakers’ names.) “And I can sum all of this up, unfortunately, with one word. That is Psyops. Now most people may hear that and they think, ‘Oh my God, they’re trying to brainwash.’ ” “What are you, some kind of a nut?” Mr. Rumsfeld cut in, drawing laughter. “You don’t believe in the Constitution?” There was little discussion about the actual criticism pouring forth from Mr. Rumsfeld’s former generals. Analysts argued that opposition to the war was rooted in perceptions fed by the news media, not reality. The administration’s overall war strategy, they counseled, was “brilliant” and “very successful.” “Frankly,” one participant said, “from a military point of view, the penalty, 2,400 brave Americans whom we lost, 3,000 in an hour and 15 minutes, is relative.”
us,An analyst said at another point: “This is a wider war. And whether we have democracy in Iraq or not, it doesn’t mean a tinker’s damn if we end up with the result we want, which is a regime over there that’s not a threat to us.” “Yeah,” Mr. Rumsfeld said, taking notes. But winning or not, they bluntly warned, the administration was in grave political danger so long as most Americans viewed Iraq as a lost cause. “America hates a loser,” one analyst said. Much of the session was devoted to ways that Mr. Rumsfeld could reverse the “political tide.” One analyst urged Mr. Rumsfeld to “just crush these people,” and assured him that “most of the gentlemen at the table” would enthusiastically support him if he did. “You are the leader,” the analyst told Mr. Rumsfeld. “You are our guy.” At another point, an analyst made a suggestion: “In one of your speeches you ought to say, ‘Everybody stop for a minute and imagine an Iraq ruled by Zarqawi.’ And then you just go down the list and say, ‘All right, we’ve got oil, money, sovereignty, access to the geographic center of gravity of the Middle East, blah, blah, blah.’ If you can just paint a mental picture for Joe America to say, ‘Oh my God, I can’t imagine a world like that.’ ”
us,Even as they assured Mr. Rumsfeld that they stood ready to help in this public relations offensive, the analysts sought guidance on what they should cite as the next “milestone” that would, as one analyst put it, “keep the American people focused on the idea that we’re moving forward to a positive end.” They placed particular emphasis on the growing confrontation with Iran. “When you said ‘long war,’ you changed the psyche of the American people to expect this to be a generational event,” an analyst said. “And again, I’m not trying to tell you how to do your job...” “Get in line,” Mr. Rumsfeld interjected. The meeting ended and Mr. Rumsfeld, appearing pleased and relaxed, took the entire group into a small study and showed off treasured keepsakes from his life, several analysts recalled. Soon after, analysts hit the airwaves. The Omnitec monitoring reports, circulated to more than 80 officials, confirmed that analysts repeated many of the Pentagon’s talking points: that Mr. Rumsfeld consulted “frequently and sufficiently” with his generals; that he was not “overly concerned” with the criticisms; that the meeting focused “on more important topics at hand,” including the next milestone in Iraq, the formation of a new government. Days later, Mr. Rumsfeld wrote a memorandum distilling their collective guidance into bullet points. Two were underlined: “Focus on the Global War on Terror — not simply Iraq. The wider war — the long war.” “Link Iraq to Iran. Iran is the concern. If we fail in Iraq or Afghanistan, it will help Iran.”
us,But if Mr. Rumsfeld found the session instructive, at least one participant, General Nash, the ABC analyst, was repulsed. “I walked away from that session having total disrespect for my fellow commentators, with perhaps one or two exceptions,” he said. View From the Networks Two weeks ago General Petraeus took time out from testifying before Congress about Iraq for a conference call with military analysts. Mr. Garrett, the Fox analyst and Patton Boggs lobbyist, said he told General Petraeus during the call to “keep up the great work.” “Hey,” Mr. Garrett said in an interview, “anything we can do to help.” For the moment, though, because of heavy election coverage and general war fatigue, military analysts are not getting nearly as much TV time, and the networks have trimmed their rosters of analysts. The conference call with General Petraeus, for example, produced little in the way of immediate coverage. Still, almost weekly the Pentagon continues to conduct briefings with selected military analysts. Many analysts said network officials were only dimly aware of these interactions. The networks, they said, have little grasp of how often they meet with senior officials, or what is discussed. “I don’t think NBC was even aware we were participating,” said Rick Francona, a longtime military analyst for the network. Some networks publish biographies on their Web sites that describe their analysts’ military backgrounds and, in some cases, give at least limited information about their business ties. But many analysts also said the networks asked few questions about their outside business interests, the nature of their work or the potential for that work to create conflicts of interest. “None of that ever happened,” said Mr. Allard, an NBC analyst until 2006.
us,“The worst conflict of interest was no interest.” Mr. Allard and other analysts said their network handlers also raised no objections when the Defense Department began paying their commercial airfare for Pentagon-sponsored trips to Iraq — a clear ethical violation for most news organizations. CBS News declined to comment on what it knew about its military analysts’ business affiliations or what steps it took to guard against potential conflicts. NBC News also declined to discuss its procedures for hiring and monitoring military analysts. The network issued a short statement: “We have clear policies in place to assure that the people who appear on our air have been appropriately vetted and that nothing in their profile would lead to even a perception of a conflict of interest.” Jeffrey W. Schneider, a spokesman for ABC, said that while the network’s military consultants were not held to the same ethical rules as its full-time journalists, they were expected to keep the network informed about any outside business entanglements. “We make it clear to them we expect them to keep us closely apprised,” he said. A spokeswoman for Fox News said executives “refused to participate” in this article. CNN requires its military analysts to disclose in writing all outside sources of income. But like the other networks, it does not provide its military analysts with the kind of written, specific ethical guidelines it gives its full-time employees for avoiding real or apparent conflicts of interest. Yet even where controls exist, they have sometimes proven porous.
us,CNN, for example, said it was unaware for nearly three years that one of its main military analysts, General Marks, was deeply involved in the business of seeking government contracts, including contracts related to Iraq. General Marks was hired by CNN in 2004, about the time he took a management position at McNeil Technologies, where his job was to pursue military and intelligence contracts. As required, General Marks disclosed that he received income from McNeil Technologies. But the disclosure form did not require him to describe what his job entailed, and CNN acknowledges it failed to do additional vetting. “We did not ask Mr. Marks the follow-up questions we should have,” CNN said in a written statement. In an interview, General Marks said it was no secret at CNN that his job at McNeil Technologies was about winning contracts. “I mean, that’s what McNeil does,” he said. CNN, however, said it did not know the nature of McNeil’s military business or what General Marks did for the company. If he was bidding on Pentagon contracts, CNN said, that should have disqualified him from being a military analyst for the network. But in the summer and fall of 2006, even as he was regularly asked to comment on conditions in Iraq, General Marks was working intensively on bidding for a $4.6 billion contract to provide thousands of translators to United States forces in Iraq. In fact, General Marks was made president of the McNeil spin-off that won the huge contract in December 2006.
us,General Marks said his work on the contract did not affect his commentary on CNN. “I’ve got zero challenge separating myself from a business interest,” he said. But CNN said it had no idea about his role in the contract until July 2007, when it reviewed his most recent disclosure form, submitted months earlier, and finally made inquiries about his new job. “We saw the extent of his dealings and determined at that time we should end our relationship with him,” CNN said.
magazine,Can We Imagine the Life of a Terrorist? - The New York Times A decade ago, suicide bombings were still rare events. The political scientist Robert Pape counted a global total of 315 attacks from 1980, when they were first established as a modern terrorist method, through 2003. In the following two years, that number doubled. Today, the total is more than two thousand, and each day seems to bring news of more. Yet the tactic has not lost its power to shock and horrify. There has been a steady proliferation of efforts to make sense of it, not just among academics and policy wonks, but by novelists, filmmakers and artists the world over. John Updike (whose penultimate novel was “Terrorist”) and John le Carré may be better known in the West, but there are dozens of others who have tried to dramatize the world of violent jihad, including the Algerian novelist Yasmina Khadra and the Moroccan writer Mohammed Achaari. In a sense, these efforts are the literary analogue of the “Global War on Terror,” which is only now belatedly coming to a close — or so President Obama promised last month. In fiction as in politics, the enemy’s outlines grew vague and vast; he was too big to be tried in our courts, too deadly to be fought without torture, too radical to be understood. We imagined an enemy worthy of the grief and terror he caused us. For the most part, the results have been disappointing; awe has outpaced understanding, and few writers or filmmakers, with a small number of notable exceptions, including the remarkable 2005 film “Paradise Now,” have succeeded in depicting their zealots as fully human.
magazine,In that sense, Ziad Doueiri’s new film, “The Attack,” is a refreshing change. The movie, which has its premiere in the United States on June 21, is about a successful Israeli-Arab surgeon whose wife blows herself up in a crowded Tel Aviv restaurant, killing 17 other people. The doctor is a well-integrated and apolitical man whose friends are mostly Jews, and his wife’s act explodes his life. (The actor who plays him, Ali Suliman, also played one of the two suicide bombers in “Paradise Now.”) He is bent on understanding why, and the film proceeds like a well-paced detective novel, with the doctor traveling to Nablus and tracing the threads of his wife’s secret life. But Doueiri soon brings us up short. In a climactic scene, the doctor arrives in a darkened sanctuary and confronts the cleric who appears initially to have inspired his wife’s descent into violence. In response to his question — what would drive a seemingly happy upper-middle-class woman to blow herself up in a crowded restaurant? — he gets only a kind of riddle. “If you haven’t understood a thing since you set foot here, it means you probably never will,” the cleric tells him.
magazine,In other words, the film all but dismisses the question of motive — always at the center of dramas about suicide bombing — as impenetrable. The bomber is largely absent from the story, glimpsed only in brief flashbacks. When her husband insists that he wants the truth, the cleric counters: “Which truth? Hers or yours?” In the end, the doctor is left with the troubling conclusion of one of his Israeli friends: “It can happen to anyone. It can fall on you like a tile or grow in you like a worm. Then you don’t see the world in the same way. You’re just waiting for the moment to cross the threshold.” This refusal to accept rational explanations also separates the film, whose suicide bomber is explicitly not a jihadi, from Khadra’s novel, on which it is based. Khadra has written about zealots in Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel, as well as in his native Algeria, and he seems bent on illustrating the ideology and circumstances that turn ordinary young men (and women) into human weapons. No other writer, to my knowledge, has written so much fiction on the subject of jihad. Khadra (who writes in French) has a gift for quick, vivid character sketches, and his evocations of street life and police thuggery in the slums of Algiers are powerful. But his jihadis sometimes read like agglomerations of what political scientists have been telling us for years (young men with few opportunities who hear an eloquent sermon from a radical imam, and presto). The hero of Khadra’s novel “Wolf Dreams,” a frustrated young actor in Algiers, joins the underground Islamist movement and suddenly, “for the first time in his life, he was discovering himself, becoming aware of his status, his importance, his usefulness as a person, as a being. At last he was alive. He mattered.” Within another 30 pages, the man who started off as a sensitive young artist with no affinity for religion is coldly gunning down judges, and you can guess where it ends. The fact that such things may have literally taken place in Algiers doesn’t make them feel any more convincing on the page.
magazine,The literary failures may derive from the fact that Khadra, like many of the academic experts at West Point and elsewhere who have written lucidly about the motives of jihadis, was trained to think of them as targets. He was a high-ranking officer in the Algerian military during the “dirty war” of the 1990s, when atrocities on all sides became almost commonplace. That experience marked him, and his subsequent literary career is largely an effort to make sense of it. But he has done so while remaining loyal to the Algerian military and unwilling to recognize its complicity in the brutalities of the civil war. As a lifelong soldier who entered cadet school at age 9 (an experience he describes vividly in a memoir), Khadra may, for all his efforts, still be at least partly captive to a rigid military culture that reflexively defines Islamists as monsters and traitors. If terrorist-hunters often seem unable to cross the threshold into true sympathy for their enemies, the jihadis themselves are often equally unsatisfying witnesses to their own experience. Those who choose to tell their stories have usually turned away from jihad and have often done so with a violence equal to that of their original conversion. The Saudi journalist Mshari al-Zaydi, for instance, is one of a number of former jihadis who now regularly fulminate in print against the dangers of mixing religion and politics. Their own past experience becomes fodder for the counter-crusade, and it is hard to know how much to trust even their first-person accounts. A few former jihadis have written convincing memoirs, including the Egyptian journalist Khaled al-Berry, the author of “Life Is More Beautiful Than Paradise.” But al-Berry, by his own account, never got too far down the road to terrorism.
magazine,The most interesting jihadi characters remain the real ones, as conveyed in nonfiction accounts by journalists like Lawrence Wright, Peter Bergen, Steve Coll and Terry McDermott. The contradictions of Osama bin Laden’s much-celebrated life — heir to a vast fortune who chose to live in caves — helped make him an inspirational figure for countless young radicals. Many jihadis have been tortured, which almost inevitably becomes a watershed moment. And many have had second thoughts, though getting them to admit it is not easy. Ken Ballen, the author of the 2011 book “Terrorists in Love,” found one of the first suicide bombers in Iraq to survive his attack, a Saudi man who went on to become a passionate critic of terrorism. Ballen also elicited a fascinating confession from a Saudi militant who was from a prominent religious family and who had a passionate love affair with his male first cousin.
magazine,But these are wild exceptions. The everyday reality of life in the jihad is often closer to a bumbling black comedy than to a redemptive tragedy or a bildungsroman. Many of those who land in terrorist groups are criminals or desperate men with a history of failure and a thirst for revenge. Most major terrorist attempts in the past decade have ended in humiliation, like Richard Reid’s shoe-bombing plot in 2001 and Al Qaeda’s repeated attempts to load explosives into the underwear of suicide bombers. And Al Qaeda’s regional affiliates often appear to be profoundly dysfunctional organizations, run by men whose narcissism is at odds with their solemn professions of selflessness and holy purpose. Last month The Associated Press published excerpts from an extraordinary and revealing letter, discovered in the rubble of Timbuktu after the French military routed the jihadis there. In it, the leaders of Al Qaeda’s North Africa branch accuse one of their most unruly commanders, a man named Mokhtar Belmokhtar, of failing to file expense reports, leaving his phone off, skipping meetings that he called “useless” and failing to carry out any “spectacular operations.” They complain about Belmokhtar’s “backbiting, name-calling and sneering” and accuse him of making a “mockery of the basics of administration.” In a passage straight out of Beckett, they describe a delegation sent to contact Belmokhtar that spent three years lost in the desert and then disintegrated without having reached him.
magazine,My own experience with the world of jihadis is littered with similar bouts of absurdity. An acquaintance who spent time in a radical religious school in northern Yemen once told me how the students, most still in their teens, would fight over the rare Western magazines that reached the school. Whoever succeeded in grabbing the pages with images of women on them (these were ordinary pictures, not pornography) would rush straight to the bathroom to masturbate. Then, inevitably, they would visit my acquaintance (who is American), telling him how they had sinned against God and could only redeem themselves by carrying out a “martyrdom operation” as soon as possible. Scrolling through the postings on jihadi Internet sites, I used to feel I was watching frustrated teenage actors, many of them begging for more attention from the West for their exploits. There are macabre attempts at humor, like the compilation of photographs of wounded American soldiers I saw in 2006 under the heading “Jihad Candid Camera.” Even the online magazine Inspire, which appears to be an entirely serious propaganda effort produced by a branch of Al Qaeda in Yemen, is full of articles that ride an eerie line between comedy and the promotion of murder, like the one titled “Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.”
magazine,Then there are the videotaped statements suicide bombers make before they die. In the abstract, there is nothing funny about these ghoulish productions, and yet there is something revelatory about the opening scene of Chris Morris’s 2010 satire “Four Lions,” in which a young British jihadi addresses the camera for his last testimonial while cradling a small toy gun. “Eh up, you unbelieving kuffar bastards,” he says in a thick Yorkshire accent. When his friends stop filming and tell him to drop the toy gun, he demurs, his face crestfallen, and insists it only looks small because he has “big hands.” “Four Lions” is an uneven film, but at its best it does for jihadis what “Spinal Tap” did for heavy metal, revealing a ludicrously adolescent consciousness at the center of a myth. “Bomb the mosque!” shouts one of the cell members in the film, a belligerent white convert to Islam named Barry. “Radicalize the moderates! Bring it all on!” You laugh. But those words, or words like them, have been spoken and acted upon by real people, with deadly results. When I asked Jean-Pierre Filiu, a French scholar and one of the most respected analysts of jihadi groups, whether anyone had really succeeded in capturing the everyday truth of their world in fiction or film, he ran through a number of novels on the subject and dismissed them all: too many were unconvincing or tied up in political agendas. Then, after a long pause, he said: “Seriously, the way most of them operate? I think ‘Four Lions’ said it best.”
magazine,If this is true, it is not because Islamist militancy and its many victims are a laughing matter or that its heroes are all better off dead. It is because satire has uncovered something real, something that is missing from most of what has been written on the subject. The moments when jihadis seem most vivid — to me, at any rate — are those when they have been brought down to scale, when we (and sometimes they) recognize the gap between their own bumbling frailty and the icy ferocity of their creed. Last year Omar Hammami, an American-born jihadi who has a $5 million reward on his head, published a memoir online that includes a number of these moments. It is written in an unmistakably American voice, full of slang and exclamation points and spontaneous, self-deprecating humor. He describes miserable slogs through the Somali jungle with the mujahedeen, terrified of lions and army ants, sick with hunger and fatigue, dreaming of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. At the end of the book, he confesses to feeling homesick and imagines being allowed just “three days” in Alabama to see his parents and his sister Dena. “After going through all the hugs and kisses, me and Dena would probably go running around town laughing our heads off and talking about a billion things without ever finishing a conversation about any of them,” he writes. Perhaps Hammami does not deserve that three-day respite. But that does not make his memoir any less poignant or less human.
opinion,Fukushima Politics - The New York Times “Zero nuclear plants.” With this recent call, Japan’s very popular former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is again in the limelight. His bold new stance challenges his protégé, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose policies would restart as many nuclear power plants as possible (now all shut down), and even promote the export of nuclear reactors. Mr. Koizumi deems the pursuit of nuclear power “aimless” and “irresponsible.” Japan should welcome Mr. Koizumi’s intervention and begin a healthy debate on the future of nuclear power that has not occurred in the two and a half years since the Fukushima disaster. The Japanese Diet did conduct an independent investigation, which concluded Fukushima to be a man-made disaster. But the investigation did not lead to serious parliamentary debate. Mr. Koizumi, whose change of views is startling, shows that there is quite a split on the issue in the political class. As a pro-growth prime minister from 2001 to 2006, he was an enthusiastic proponent of cheap and clean nuclear power. Now he declares that it is the most expensive form of energy, citing not only the many billions of dollars needed to clean up Fukushima but also the unknown cost and method of dealing with nuclear waste. He also criticizes the current government’s assumption that nuclear power is essential for economic growth. Ever the acute reader of political moods, Mr. Koizumi argues that a zero nuclear policy could be cause for a great social movement in a country still gripped by economic gloom after 15 years of deflation.
opinion,In the wake of Fukushima, one would think that the Japanese government could not restart nuclear power reactors without firm public support. Not so. According to opinion polls, the majority of Japanese oppose nuclear power, even among supporters of the Abe government. A poll last week found that 76 percent of those surveyed said they did not think the Fukushima plant was “under control.” The government reckons the earthquake and tsunami that struck Fukushima is a once-in-a-thousand-year occurrence. Yet it also estimates that there is a 60 percent to 70 percent probability of a major earthquake and tsunami hitting the most densely populated coastline within the next 30 years. That coastline, dotted with nuclear power plants, reaches from Tokyo to the southern island of Kyushu. Prime Minister Abe has been stressing the need to shed the deflation mentality for Japan to lift itself out of economic stagnation. Japan can certainly do with a change in attitude. Mr. Koizumi makes a compelling argument that if the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were to announce a zero nuclear policy, “the nation could come together in the creation of a recyclable society unseen in the world,” and the public mood would rise in an instant.
world/africa,Kenyan Court Upholds Election of Candidate Facing Charges in The Hague - The New York Times NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya’s Supreme Court on Saturday unanimously upheld the election victory of Uhuru Kenyatta as the country’s president, dismissing allegations that the vote had been rigged. But almost immediately, protests erupted in some opposition strongholds, with stone-throwing mobs squaring off against Kalashnikov-toting police officers. And Mr. Kenyatta’s legal battles are hardly over. As Kenya’s next president, Mr. Kenyatta will soon be summoned to the International Criminal Court in The Hague to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity, accused of using his vast family fortune to bankroll death squads during the chaos that exploded after Kenya’s last disputed election in 2007. He says that he is innocent and that the charges are based on gossip. But many Western officials believe otherwise, and already the Obama administration has gotten off on the wrong foot, sending the signal that it hoped Mr. Kenyatta would lose. The United States now may have little choice but to work with Mr. Kenyatta because Kenya is one of its closest allies in Africa, serving as a base for everything from running billion-dollar health programs to spying on agents of Al Qaeda. When it comes down to it, several analysts have said, the United States actually needs Kenya more than Kenya needs the United States. On Saturday afternoon, in front of a hushed courtroom, Kenya’s chief justice, Willy Mutunga, read out the verdict upholding Mr. Kenyatta’s victory, saying that the election, held nearly four weeks ago, had been conducted “in compliance with the Constitution and the law.”
world/africa,The second-place finisher, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, seemed to finally swallow his defeat. Mr. Odinga had accused Kenya’s election commission of conspiring with Mr. Kenyatta to steal the vote. In the past week, in heated hearings in front of the Supreme Court, Mr. Odinga’s lawyers presented evidence of questionable vote tallying. The Supreme Court itself concluded that there had been dozens of errors, though it appears the justices did not feel those errors would have changed the outcome — or they were wary of dragging out what had already become a long and tortuous election period. On Saturday evening, in a room full of his supporters, Mr. Odinga mopped his face with a handkerchief and said, somewhat mournfully, “The court has now spoken.” He said he would abide by its decision, and he wished Mr. Kenyatta well. A few hours later, Mr. Kenyatta spoke to the nation, saying, “I urge you to accept the election is over.” And he called for Kenyans to come together “above the partisanship.” Mr. Kenyatta, a son of Kenya’s first president and one of the country’s richest men, is expected to be sworn in on April 9. His running mate, William Ruto, soon to be deputy president, has also been charged by the International Criminal Court with crimes against humanity, accused of organizing young men to kill villagers during the last election.
world/africa,The long-awaited verdict caps weeks, if not months, of distraction, anxiety, hope and dread. In 2007 and early 2008, Kenya cracked open in riots and clashes after Mr. Odinga lost the presidential race amid evidence of vote rigging, leaving more than 1,000 dead. The horrific memories from that time have been fresh in the minds of many Kenyans, like little shards of glass painfully embedded just below the surface. Many have feared that another contested election could set off the same type of violence. On March 4, Kenyans streamed into polling places. The turnout was tremendous, around 86 percent. Some people waited 10 hours on their feet, without any food or drink, to get to the ballot box. But problems started almost immediately. A new biometric voter identification system failed, and then, after the polls closed, the electronic system to transmit results directly from the polling places to election headquarters crashed. Mr. Odinga’s side said it was a conspiracy. The election commission said it was an accident. Election officials then had to tally the results manually, which took days and opened up more possibilities for fraud. Kenya remained peaceful — but anxious — while all this was being sorted out. Mr. Odinga, Mr. Kenyatta and other leaders of all stripes urged their followers not to riot or protest. Television stations played peace messages around the clock. On March 9, the election commission declared Mr. Kenyatta the winner, saying he had squeaked past the 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff by less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Mr. Odinga, who won about 43 percent, then filed his lawsuit.
world/africa,On Saturday night, after the Supreme Court upheld Mr. Kenyatta’s victory, protests broke out in several slum areas of Nairobi, the capital, and in Kisumu, Mr. Odinga’s ethnic stronghold. His supporters tried to barricade roads with burning tires, but police officers shot in the air and chased them away. “It’s such a sad moment,” said Christine Ololo Atieno, a shoe-seller in Kisumu. “We saw evidence that the election wasn’t free or fair. Now we feel our rights have been sacrificed for the happiness of others.” Both the British and American governments, which had not congratulated Mr. Kenyatta when he was declared the winner in early March, issued statements on Saturday night congratulating him.
us/politics,Obama Releases Long-Form Birth Certificate - The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Obama released his long-form birth certificate on Wednesday, a step that injected him directly into the simmering “birther” controversy in the hope of finally ending it, or even turning it to his advantage. The gamble produced dramatic television as Mr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room to address, head on, a subject that had been deemed irrelevant by everyone in his orbit for years even as it stoked conservative efforts to undermine his legitimacy as president. Mr. Obama’s comments risked elevating the discredited questions about where he was born, but also allowed him to cast his political opponents as focused on the trivial at a time when the nation is facing more important issues. And because much of the recent attention about where he was born came from Donald J. Trump, who says he is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination and spent the day campaigning in New Hampshire, it allowed the White House to use Mr. Trump as a foil for the president’s efforts to cast himself as a more serious leader than his potential rivals in the 2012 race. “We’re not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers,” Mr. Obama said, a clear reference — if not by name — to Mr. Trump.
us/politics,Mr. Obama’s complaint that the controversy threatened to distract politicians from the country’s big problems produced a hall-of-mirrors-like reverberation from his Republican adversaries, some of whom had raised doubts about his birthplace but now accused the president of releasing the documents to distract from the country’s big problems. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement: “The president ought to spend his time getting serious about repairing our economy, working with Republicans and focusing on the long-term sustainability of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Unfortunately his campaign politics and talk about birth certificates is distracting him from our No. 1 priority — our economy.” Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and a potential 2012 rival, said in a Twitter message that the news media should not “let the WH distract you w/the birth crt” from stories like the public comments of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve bank. False accusations about Mr. Obama’s being born abroad — and the implication that his election was thus invalid — have percolated on the Internet and among conspiracy theorists since the early days of his presidential campaign, when aides distributed a shorter version of the birth certificate that is normally given out by officials in Hawaii. But White House officials concluded about a month ago that the falsehoods had moved from “the nether regions of the Internet” into the mainstream political arena, thanks in large part to the efforts of Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and reality television host who has used the issue as a media magnet.
us/politics,A New York Times survey taken two weeks ago found that nearly 25 percent of Americans believed Mr. Obama was born in another country; 45 percent of Republicans said they believed that. Some Democratic activists crowed Wednesday that Mr. Obama had slyly offered a contrast between the president and his likely Republican challengers. Markos Moulitsas, a liberal blogger, wrote, “What better way to show how out of touch and irrational Republicans are than to rub this in their face?” But White House aides turned back that suggestion, saying it would have been more politically savvy to let the Republicans continue to question his birth certificate since the conservatives most interested in that issue are unlikely to vote for Mr. Obama anyway. The birth certificate, which is posted on the White House Web site, shows that Mr. Obama was born in Honolulu and is signed by state officials and his mother. It is more detailed than the one officials presented during the 2008 campaign, showing the name of the hospital where Mr. Obama was born and including the signature of the attending physician. Hawaii does not normally release the long-form certificate, but did so in response to a request for a waiver of state policy by Mr. Obama and his lawyers. In a news conference Wednesday morning that produced split-screen images on cable television networks, Mr. Trump claimed credit for forcing Mr. Obama’s hand, saying, “I feel I’ve accomplished something really, really important.” But he said the document would have to be examined for authenticity.
us/politics,“We have to look at it. A lot of people have to look at it,” he said. “I hope it’s true, and the reason I hope it’s true is because we have real problems in this country.” Chatter on Internet forums suggested that hard-core conspiracy buffs were unlikely to be convinced by the White House disclosure. Several postings suggested that the document might be a forgery; others sought to shift the topic to questions about Mr. Obama’s adoption by his stepfather. White House officials said they hoped to at least bring an end to discussion of the topic in the mainstream news. “I know that there’s going to be a segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest,” Mr. Obama said. “But I’m speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness.” Mr. Obama, at a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York on Wednesday night, made light of the issue. "My name is Barack Obama, I was born in Hawaii, I’m president of the United States, and I’m running for re-election," he said, grinning. The Democratic Party faithful cheered.
sports/golf,Hideki Matsuyama Trips in Pursuit of a Breakthrough at the P.G.A. Championship - The New York Times CHARLOTTE, N.C. — When Hideki Matsuyama climbed the 48 steps from the Quail Hollow practice green to the first tee on Saturday, he took them two at a time, as if to show that the lead he held halfway through the P.G.A. Championship was not weighing heavily on him. Since he made the cut at the Masters as a teenager in 2011, Matsuyama has been expected in his homeland, Japan, to become the first player from the country to win a men’s major. Six years later, the expectation of Matsuyama’s coronation hung over the course, as though balloons and confetti were ready to be released from the cover of clouds. But the bounce in Matsuyama’s step could not hide his nerves, which revealed themselves in several loose swings in his round of two-over-par 73. Going into Sunday’s final round, he is tied for second with Chris Stroud (72) at six under over all, a stroke behind Kevin Kisner, who carded a 72 on Saturday. “I’m disappointed the way I played today,” Matsuyama said through an interpreter. He added, “Probably the pressure had to do with it.” Matsuyama, the third-ranked player in the world, was coming off a win six days earlier at a World Golf Championships event in Ohio, where he closed with a 61. On Friday, he had carded a bogey-free 64.
sports/golf,The fans swarming the course were not going to see the American Jordan Spieth complete a career grand slam, but it appeared they still might be witnesses to history. “I think Hideki, with the way he’s been playing, his misses seem to be birdies right now,” Spieth said after an even-par 71 that left him hopelessly out of range of the leaders. He added: “When you have it going, you have it going. He’s going to be tough to beat.” Spieth has spent his share of time facing outsize expectations. Yet he acknowledged that he could not relate to what the 25-year-old Matsuyama must be feeling. “It’s hard for me to speak to the pressure he could feel winning the first major for his country,” said Spieth, who also talked honestly after his round about the degree of difficulty this major poses for him. “I feel like my game truly suits the other three majors maybe more than a P.G.A. Championship,” said Spieth, whose only top 10 in this tournament in four previous starts was a second-place finish in 2015. “But I believe we can play anywhere and win anywhere. It’s just a matter of having everything in sync at the right time.” Matsuyama, who has won six times worldwide in the past 10 months, was out of sync from the moment he reached the top of those 48 steps from the practice green. His opening drive landed in the right rough, and his right arm flew off the club during his follow through. Matsuyama’s streak of 22 holes without a bogey ended on No. 1 when he missed a 6-foot par putt.
sports/golf,“The worries that I had about my swing showed up today in the way I played,” Matsuyama said. He was in the final grouping with Kisner and Jason Day, who has gotten to know Matsuyama while playing alongside him in two Presidents Cups. Last Sunday, Day sent Matsuyama a text message that read: “Congrats, mate. Unreal playing. See you next week.” On Friday, Day described Matsuyama as “a really good guy” who is the “hardest worker out here right now.” Matsuyama’s swing tempo is the envy of his competitors. But playing Saturday in humidity that was only slightly more oppressive than the expectations placed on him, Matsuyama struggled to find his rhythm. He found just two fairways on the front nine. If Matsuyama appeared to be mentally drained, it might have been because he had talked long into Friday night about his round of 64. He submitted to at least seven television interviews with crews from Japan, Europe and the United States. He sat for a news conference in English and then met with a group of nearly two dozen members of the news media from Asia. “He’s been under big pressure since he started playing the PGA Tour,” said Rex Kuramoto, who played professionally in Japan and is now a commentator for Golf Channel’s Japanese-language broadcasts. “So this pressure is nothing new to him.”
sports/golf,In 1977, Hisako Higuchi of Japan won the L.P.G.A. Championship in Myrtle Beach, S.C., to become the first Asian-born golfer to win a major. Higuchi was 31 years old, and upon her return to Tokyo she was feted with a ticker-tape parade. The best finish by a Japanese player in a men’s major was Isao Aoki’s second place behind Jack Nicklaus in the 1980 United States Open. Aoki, who had five top-10 finishes in majors, began the final round of the 1980 Open tied with Nicklaus, who carded a 68 to Aoki’s 70. If Matsuyama were to end the men’s major championship wait, Kuramoto said, “it would be a big, big deal.” The men’s game in Japan is overshadowed by the women’s. Could a win here by Matsuyama flip that dynamic? “I’m not really sure,” Matsuyama said in his news conference Friday night. “But hopefully, come Sunday, I can come back and visit you all here, and that would help increase the popularity of the men’s game in Japan.”
sports/baseball,After Coming Up Short, Indians Open Wallet to Add Edwin Encarnacion - The New York Times The Cleveland Indians, a small-market team that came within one victory of a World Series title last month, have now added significant firepower to their lineup. And they did it, in what probably amounts to a surprise, by finding a way to reach an agreement with the right-handed slugger Edwin Encarnacion, one of the top free agents this winter. The deal, seen across the sport as a coup for the small-revenue Indians, is for three years at $55 million. With a $5 million buyout for a 2020 team option, Encarnacion, who will be 34 next month and has been one of the sport’s best power hitters over the past five years, is guaranteed $60 million over three years, said a baseball person with direct knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. If the Indians pick up the option, $25 million for the fourth year, then Encarnacion would make $80 million. The Indians clearly are careful with their money, ranking in the bottom third of team payrolls in 2016. Nor were they much of a draw last season, ranking just 28th in team attendance, although that figure should improve significantly in 2017 in a carry-over of fan enthusiasm from the team’s postseason run.
sports/baseball,Encarnacion should help draw more fans, too. A late-blossoming hitter, he turned into a three-time All-Star during his eight years with the Toronto Blue Jays. Since 2012, Encarnacion, a Dominican Republic native, has averaged 39 home runs, 110 runs batted in and a .912 on-base-plus-slugging-percentage a season. Only Chris Davis of the Baltimore Orioles has hit more home runs (197) than Encarnacion (193) in that period. True, Encarnacion benefited from being part of a talented group of Blue Jays hitters, but he nevertheless was a consistent force in the heart of the Toronto lineup. Although Encarnacion wanted to remain in Toronto, he rejected a four-year, $80 million offer from the Blue Jays this winter, perhaps holding out for more. The Blue Jays moved on and signed designated hitter Kendrys Morales and the utility man Steve Pearce, essentially shutting the door on a reunion with Encarnacion. The budget-conscious Oakland Athletics, perhaps sensing a bargain, and the Texas Rangers, the defending American League West champions, also pursued Encarnacion. But it was the Indians who took the financial plunge and will now forfeit a low 2017 first-round pick as compensation for luring him away from Toronto. Encarnacion’s agent, Paul Kinzer, said on MLB Network Radio on Friday that he was at an amusement park with his grandchildren when he completed the deal by phone with Chris Antonetti, the Indians’ president, who happened to be at a “Nutcracker” performance with his family. That makes for a nice footnote in a deal that may have major implications in the 2017 baseball landscape.
sports/baseball,Encarnacion probably will replace Mike Napoli, the 35-year-old veteran first baseman-designated hitter, who had 34 home runs and 101 R.B.I. for the Indians in 2016. Those were good numbers — almost as good as Encarnacion’s 2016 output — but Napoli has not managed the consistent season-to-season production that Encarnacion has achieved.

Winston, who completed 19 of 29 passes for 246 yards over all, had four touchdown throws in the first half, to four receivers. He tied Matthew Stafford’s rookie mark from 2009 in the third quarter on an 8-yard pass to Cameron Brate, the fifth Tampa Bay receiver with a scoring catch on Sunday. Entering the day, Winston had not thrown for more than two touchdowns in a game.

us/politics,Parties Coming to More Agreement (Just Not on Who Deserves Credit) - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  As the House and Senate head into a challenging few weeks after some early legislative successes, the fight over who deserves credit for getting Congress back to work is almost as intense as the policy and political struggles being waged on the floor. Republicans say their leadership has been responsible for returning Congress, and particularly the Senate, to the semblance of a functioning institution in the opening months of Republican control of Capitol Hill. Bills are passing, amendments are pending, bipartisan deals are percolating. Democrats agree that progress is being made but cite an alternative reason: Democrats are not acting the way Republicans did in the minority. They are more open to negotiating with the new majority, they say, rather than shutting down the Senate via filibuster as they accused Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority turned majority leader, of doing in recent years. “We believe in government,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democrat who Republicans say stifled the Senate as majority leader by thwarting votes on amendments. “The cynical view of the Republicans in opposing President Obama on virtually everything has really hurt the institution,” Mr. Reid said. “If I had decided to be a McConnell-like leader, it would have been so bad for our country.” Republicans say the real difference is that Mr. McConnell has opened up the Senate and allowed members of both parties to push their ideas on the floor and in committee, leading to resolution rather than impasse.
us/politics,Legislation that has hit the floor has advanced, including terrorism insurance, a veterans’ suicide prevention bill, Homeland Security spending, authorization to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline, major Medicare changes and an anti-sex-trafficking bill. In some cases, though, the pace has been sluggish. “A lot of this is just restoring the Senate to its traditional function, letting the committee process work,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. “Everyone feels invested in an outcome.” “We have just gone through a very bad period for the Senate and for the country, and I am optimistic we are now emerging into a restoration of what the Senate used to be in a way that is going to be good for the American people,” he said. He and other top Republicans like to note that many Senate Democrats have commended them for allowing more opportunity to try to reshape bills through amendments. But Mr. McConnell and others also admit that Democrats have been willing partners. “We’ve given them an opportunity, and they’ve taken that opportunity,” Mr. McConnell said recently. “And so I think they do deserve some credit for it.” From the Democratic perspective, Mr. McConnell is wise to give them a shout-out since ultimately they are helping him succeed. For instance, they provided the majority to pass the Homeland Security funding measure in February, enabling him to avoid an embarrassing shutdown early in his leadership tenure.
us/politics,And while Democrats have employed the filibuster, they have used it to wring concessions out of Republicans and to press for their own amendments, not to kill legislative proposals outright. Plus, a Democratic president occupies the White House, giving Democrats more incentive to get along with their counterparts. Mr. McConnell might need Democrats again in the coming days to advance a bipartisan measure giving Congress a say over the Iran nuclear deal. Last week, conservative Republicans — angry that their amendments were not being heard — employed a guerrilla procedural tactic on the floor to throw consideration of the measure into disarray. Democrats, wanting to maintain the bipartisan coalition behind the bill, have resisted the urge to offer amendments. “We are grabbing their bacon out of the fire,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “We are effectively providing their majority for reasonable measures that meet common goals.” How long that cooperation might last is impossible to predict. Democrats are already threatening to withhold support from spending bills that do not meet their demands for new money, setting up a likely budget showdown. And they are balking at new trade proposals, though Republicans eager for a trade win are framing that revolt as a rejection of Mr. Obama’s trade agenda by his own party. At the same time, Republicans are split over whether to renew the charter for the Export-Import Bank and what to do about an expiring highway measure. They are also bracing for another brutal fight over increasing the federal debt limit, this time with their party controlling both the House and Senate.
us/politics,But for the moment Republicans are feeling good. The House gave final approval last week to the 2016 budget negotiated with the Senate and passed its first two appropriations bills at the earliest point in years. It also teed up major Pentagon, cybersecurity and surveillance measures for debate after lawmakers return from recess. “Both the full House and our committees, essentially, doubled their output from the last Congress,” Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said. “We’ve got a lot left to do, but we’re listening to the American people and we’re getting things done.” Some of the progress is clearly the result of pent-up demand after the stalemates of Congresses past. Both the terror insurance and veterans’ suicide measures, for example, were held up at the end of 2014 by Republican objections. The Medicare bill that resolved a longstanding issue with doctor fees has been ripe for a resolution for years, but Democrats and Republicans only now managed to come together. “Most of these bills could have passed last Congress,” Mr. Reid said. Still, four years of partisan stasis seems to be drawing to a close. Whether the reason is Democratic cooperation, Republican willingness to open up the floor and deal with Democrats or some combination of the two, Congress is shaking off some of the rust.
books/review,Book Review | 'Sleeping It Off in Rapid City,' by August Kleinzahler - The New York Times Raised in Fort Lee, N.J., long based in San Francisco and drawn by wanderlust or employment to Montreal, Lisbon, Auckland, Austin, Dubai and Berlin, August Kleinzahler is as much a travel writer as he is a poet: his sometimes bitter, sometimes astonished poems (several even entitled “Traveler’s Tales”) seek the distinctive qualities of each place, repellent or beautiful or (in places he loves best) both at once. In Vancouver, “the neon mermaid over the fish place / looks best that way, in the rain.” At Coney Island, “a cluster of hip-hop Lubavitch punks” watch Neil Diamond (yes, it’s really him) amble past on the sand; in the American South, the poet imagines “pecans suffering /their convoluted slumber in the heat.” The poet’s interest in places spans the globe now, but it began with his native New Jersey, where (an early poem called “Poetics” says) “I have loved the air outside Shop-Rite Liquor / on summer evenings/ better than the Marin hills at dusk.” Few poets since William Carlos Williams have done more for the Garden State, or rendered with such mixed feelings what they saw there.
books/review,North Jersey also gives Kleinzahler his other great subject: American masculinity, the qualities we attribute to tough guys and men. Kleinzahler’s sole book of prose, “Cutty, One Rock,” begins and ends in the Fort Lee of his youth, a gruff, if upscale, Mafia stronghold. “Boys are formed by the playgrounds they come from,” he wrote there. “Ours was violent, noisy and profane.” That book ends with a memoir of the poet’s adored older brother, “a tough guy, a jock,” a “hard-living, hard-loving, haunted, hounded kid” who killed himself in the early 1970s. The poems (unlike the prose) rarely discuss masculinity outright: instead, they take on, and render aesthetically interesting, the qualities that tough guys are supposed to have. They can be, for example, caustic, even sarcastic; interested in baseball, in airplanes, in old-fashioned bars; attracted to sharp, rough or grating textures and sounds; and unlikely to examine in detail the reasons behind their emotions. Instead, especially if they name those emotions, they turn laconic and stop short.
books/review,Laconic guys (as in the early Hemingway) may be trying not to lie, or trying not to let themselves believe lies. Kleinzahler organizes many poems by simple accretion, detail following detail, as if any argument or story would imply an attempt to deceive: he therefore makes most points through juxtapositions. The title poem depicts “Cretaceous pink sandstone,” “the Black Hills School of Beauty” and the “campaign headquarters of one Jack Billion” (a real person, now the head of South Dakota’s Democratic Party). The same block that holds “the exact center of the Oglala known universe” contains the incongruously opulent hotel where the poet wakes up to a freight train “rattling through this sleeping town.” “Here, at the exact dead center of America,” white tourists can admire the landscapes sacred to the same Indians their ancestors killed. One topic here is American (male) hypocrisy, but the other (set against the sandstone’s permanence) is the traveling poet’s transience: he cannot belong to this “sacred place,” cannot find more than temporary “surcease here from all my cares.”
books/review,Kleinzahler’s poems stumble and lope with a technique on the far side of fluency, one that can no more be approximated by naïve writers than a beginner can play fluent free jazz. Most pages use long lines along with an intricate syntax, diving into metrical regularity for just a phrase or two: when Kleinzahler asks himself, in a poem about dreams, “who were they all in your sleep last night?” the triple rhythm renders ironic the quiet “big room” where he wakes up alone. Kleinzahler sometimes deploys another kind of line, always end-stopped and nearly unpunctuated, whose slow progress mimics perception itself: “There goes another plane / Its engines reverberating in the clouds / Now sirens too / Very like the sirens we heard only yesterday.” Unpromising subjects, apparently ugly scenes, attract Kleinzahler in part thanks to his temperament, so averse to conventional prettiness, and in part because they offer a challenge: “two snails” crawling along “the inside of a Granny Goose / Hawaiian-style potato chips,” “cool among shadows and cellophane,” require all his skills before we, too, can find them interesting. Though the poems offer easy visual analogies — to Ashcan School scenes, say, or film noir establishing shots — they also compare themselves to music. Kleinzahler worked for years as a record reviewer; his eclectic tastes let him bring into his poems show tunes, Mozart, jazz from Dixieland to Mingus and Monk, even a gamelan orchestra, whose “shimmering arabesques ... ring in the treble as though beaten out / on a thousand wee anvils, xylophones clicking like hail.”
books/review,Like all selected-and-new volumes, this one shows continuities along with the ways in which the poet has changed. Kleinzahler’s first alter egos were derelicts: “Jimmy the Lush,” and a drunk named Johnny who wandered through Montreal “burning off all the stillborn Johnnys / that hatched in his head in the night.” Now his doppelgängers are weary professionals: frequent fliers who stay “at the Hotel Oblivion” and say to themselves, “I cannot yet recall what city this is”; a great architect; and a “famous travel writer” with no “home / except that of airports / and a perpetual predawn realm.” Kleinzahler never speaks from a height, much less from a lectern. On the other hand he is no populist and never pretends to know less than he does. He seems, instead, to write the poems that he wants to read. Those poems describe aversions and attractions, things discovered and overheard, friends met in adulthood and, on rare occasions, the poet’s own youth, served up with a compression that approximates (but never becomes) self-mockery: “What a lot of erections, voidings, pretzels, / bouncing the ball against the stoop. / She really did love you, all along.”
books/review,Kleinzahler’s first books (published in the 1970s in Canada) started and ended in melancholy solitude: one compact poem began with the word “Loneliness,” another recorded “sadness coming on in waves.” The poet seems happier now. He has written about sex, and about difficult breakups, since his 20s, but only now can he write well about romantic love. The wonderfully counterintuitive “Anniversary” finds an emblem of marriage in a hawk whose cry (“kee-eeee-arrr, kee-eeee-arrr, / a harsh, descending sound”) seems threatening, even “terrible,” to human ears, yet summons, for the hawk, the companion it seeks: “off they flew ... / enraptured by all they were, were able to do, / not as separate beings, but as two.” The tough poet, like the hawk, has found — however unlikely — a suitable mate. Kleinzahler’s poems of guyhood, like his poems of travel (they are often the same poems), make fun of the very qualities they admire: when they praise Shop-Rite Liquor, or envy the raw sex drive of a tomcat “grooving to a limbic tomtom,” they are kidding and they are not kidding at once. Many poets try to sound tough, or masculine, or self-conscious about manhood, and fail miserably: what qualities let Kleinzahler succeed? His eye, and his ear — he is, first and last, a craftsman, a maker of lines — but also his range of tones, and his self-restraint: he never says more than he should, rarely repeats himself and keeps his focus not on the man who speaks the poems (and whose personality comes across anyway) but on what that man sees and on what he can hear.
business,In November, Car Sales Showed Signs of Stability - The New York Times DETROIT — New-vehicle sales in the United States were flat for the second consecutive month in November, a sign that the market was gradually recovering from the lows hit this year. General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota and Honda each said their sales were about the same last month as they were a year ago. The only big carmaker to report a large drop was Chrysler, whose sales fell 26 percent. Hyundai, in contrast, reported a 46 percent increase. New vehicles were selling at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of nearly 11 million in November, according to MotorIntelligence.com, which tracks the industry. That is slightly higher than  the 10.5 million rate in October  and much higher than the historically low rate of about nine million early this year. “The market is slowly steadying itself and gaining strength,” Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.’s chief market  analyst,  said in  a conference call with analysts and reporters. “We’re encouraged.” To meet the increase in demand, G.M. said it would build 75 percent more vehicles in the first quarter than it did a year earlier, and Ford said it would raise first-quarter production by 58 percent. Both companies had been drastically cutting production since the middle of last year. The November selling rate was the year’s highest, outside of July and August, when sales surged during the government’s cash-for-clunkers program. The program gave a credit of up to $4,500 to about 700,000 new-vehicle buyers who turned in less fuel-efficient cars or trucks.
business,Though far below the 17 million rate that was common earlier this decade, November’s results were positive for an industry that is suffering its steepest one-year slump since the 1970s. “We saw a significant uptick in traffic, but not to the levels of the robust years of the past,” Ken Czubay,  Ford’s vice president for United States sales, service and marketing, said. “With the cloud over our heads of unemployment and consumer confidence not completely clear, we’ll have guarded optimism for December.” Through 11 months of 2009, industry sales were down 24 percent compared with those in the period a year earlier. A year ago, many would-be buyers were unable to obtain financing, and the Detroit automakers were making their first pleas to Congress for billions of dollars in emergency aid to help them stay in business. Today, many automakers are increasing production because  of rising sales and low inventories. But they are moving cautiously because of uncertainty about how quickly the economy will rebound next year. “We can see now that a modest economic recovery is under way,” Emily Kolinski Morris,  Ford’s senior United States economist, said. “It won’t begin to feel like a recovery until the labor market has begun to improve materially.” But there are “no signs of backtracking,” she said, “which is a welcome development.” The one large carmaker that has so far been missing out on the industry’s recovery is Chrysler, which left bankruptcy protection in June. Chrysler’s sales were down 38 percent this year through November, and it has continued to report double-digit percentage declines in recent months even as its competitors have begun to show signs of strength.
business,Ford, which separated itself from its crosstown rivals by not filing for bankruptcy protection or taking government loans, is on pace to increase its share of the United States market this year. Ford’s market share has fallen every year since 1995. Through October, Ford’s share was 15.2 percent, up from 14.3 percent in the first 10 months of 2008. Ford’s sales in November were up 0.1 percent while G.M.’s were down 2 percent. Toyota’s were up 3 percent. Honda’s were down 3 percent. Nissan’s rose 21 percent. Hyundai led the industry’s gains last month, as it had through most of 2009 by appealing to consumers who wanted lower-priced but reliable alternatives to some more popular vehicles. A report released Tuesday by the Environmental Protection Agency gave Hyundai another lift by showing that it had topped Honda to sell the nation’s most fuel-efficient vehicle lineup. At G.M., the four brands being sold or shut down  —  Hummer, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn  —  accounted for just 8 percent of sales in November. Sales at those brands were down 48 percent from a year ago, while sales of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC vehicles were up 6 percent. G.M. built its last Pontiac, a G6 sedan, at a plant in Orion Township, Mich., last week. Susan Docherty,  G.M.’s vice president for United States sales, said Tuesday that the company expected to exhaust its inventory for Pontiac and Saturn in about three months.
business,“They’re going quickly,” she said. “The wind-down of both of these brands is progressing very nicely, and it’s actually exceeding our expectations in terms of the sales progress.”
us/politics,Gun Control Wall, Bolstered by Republicans, Shows a Crack - The New York Times WASHINGTON — A widely publicized sit-in by House Democrats. A bipartisan compromise proposal in the Senate. Neither is very likely to lead to any legislative action in Congress on gun safety this year. Election Day is too close, and most of the Republican opposition is too dug in. But the fact that a legislative response remains elusive does not mean there has been no movement on the issue. Members of both parties say they sensed a shift in the gun debate after the mass killing in Orlando, Fla., a notable difference in attitude from the reaction on Capitol Hill after previous horrific shootings. Eight Senate Republicans joined with 44 Democrats on a Republican-proposed compromise that would deny people on two different federal watch lists the ability to buy weapons unless they could successfully appeal that decision. Several other Republican senators showed some willingness to accept new restrictions on gun purchases if they could be structured in an acceptable way. A bipartisan companion measure also was introduced in the House. These are incremental steps, but in the gridlocked world of gun control politics, they count for something. One explanation for the change is that Omar Mateen, the Orlando killer, used his legally purchased firearms in the commission of a terrorist act. Some Republicans say they are willing to challenge the mind-set of no new gun control — and the National Rifle Association — in the interest of trying to prevent similar terrorist attacks.
us/politics,Republicans find it much easier to explain enacting gun restrictions to constituents devoted to the Second Amendment if they can frame their position as an act against terrorism. “The Constitution’s a sacred document, but it is not a suicide pact,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a gun owner. “This is not hard for me. Due process is important, but at the end of the day, we are at war.” To Democrats, any hint of daylight between some Republicans and the N.R.A. is welcome. “For the first time in quite a while you’re seeing some Republicans buck the N.R.A.,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, who is likely to be the Democratic leader next year. After watching Democrats tie up the Senate with a 15-hour filibuster and Democrats occupy the House floor with a 25-hour sit-in that exploded on social media, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, is eager to take up other issues. “Clearly, we have got to move on,” Mr. McConnell said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” though he added, “This is an issue, obviously, we’ll be revisiting again in the future.” “Whether people like it or not, there is a constitutional right in our country to own and possess a firearm,” he said.
us/politics,Mr. McConnell was heavily invested in making sure the compromise plan offered by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and opposed by the N.R.A., ended up short of the filibuster-proof level of 60 votes. He does not want to be remembered as the leader of a Republican-controlled Senate that defied the gun rights group, one of the most powerful allies of his party. And he allowed a competing alternative by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, that probably siphoned Republican votes from the Collins plan. But the votes exposed a small universe of Republican senators who might eventually be willing to support gun restrictions in the interest of preventing terrorism, perhaps enough to eventually push a compromise proposal to the hallowed 60-vote level. “The fact that terrorism has become intertwined with the gun issue puts greater pressure on Republican senators and Senator McConnell to get something done,” Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats acknowledge the latest round of debate on gun control is good politics for them, particularly in swing states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Ohio that will be crucial to deciding control of the Senate in November. Polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans would deny those on terrorism watch lists the ability to buy guns, which the Collins bill proposed. As the Collins proposal gained steam after the defeat of other, more partisan proposals, Democrats discussed opposing it. They worried that strong Democratic backing would allow a handful of embattled Republicans the opportunity to cast a politically helpful gun safety vote even though no legislation would pass — an opportunity to “get well” on guns as it is known.
us/politics,Democrats said they decided to give the plan their full support to show they were serious about moving ahead with gun control even though the compromise fell short of their legislative goals and could benefit some Republicans. Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, top Democratic targets, were among those voting for the Collins plan. Though the immediate legislative prospects look dim, the gun control debate is not going to quiet down anytime soon. Energized by the attention to their sit-in, House Democrats branded Wednesday a “National Day of Action” on guns and held news conferences and protests around the country while lawmakers were home for the Fourth of July recess. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, on Monday urged Democrats to hold family sit-ins to “keep the drumbeat for action growing.” Democrats expect to return to their guerrilla tactics when the House convenes next week. Backers of the Collins proposal say they will continue to press for added support as well. Perceiving a shift in congressional sentiment and a distinct political advantage, gun control advocates are not about to give up now.

business/economy,Yellen Sees Stronger Case for Interest Rate Increase - The New York Times GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. — Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that she saw a stronger case for raising the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, suggesting the central bank was likely to act in the coming months. “In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,” Ms. Yellen said. The remarks, delivered at an annual policy conference here, indicated that the Fed would consider raising rates at its next meeting in mid-September, though most analysts say they think the central bank is more likely to move in December. In trading on Friday, the chances of a September increase rose to 36 percent from 21 percent, according to a measure derived from asset prices. The chances of a rate increase by the end of the year rose to 61 percent from 52 percent. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, who has suggested in recent months that the economy is strong enough to move, told the cable business network CNBC that a strong August employment report, due Sept. 2, “would probably weigh in our decision.” But some officials remain nervous about the fragility of this long but tepid period of economic growth.
business/economy,The Fed also may be inclined to wait until after the presidential election in November, like earlier this year, when Fed officials said they did not want to raise rates before Britain’s referendum on European Union membership in June. Ms. Yellen’s speech “leaves the Fed in a stance of watchful waiting, which is exactly where it was at the end of the last F.O.M.C. meeting in July,” Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote in an analysis. “Policy makers are leaning toward a rate hike, but feel that they can wait until they are more confident that the expansion will continue at a sustainable pace.” The Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis and predicted four more rate increases this year. Instead, it has kept its benchmark rate between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. Low rates encourage borrowing and risk-taking, which can bolster economic growth. Raising rates will gradually reduce that stimulus, and the Fed has been reluctant so far to take its foot off the gas. Ms. Yellen’s remarks appeared aimed in part at jarring the complacency of investors who had concluded that the Fed would not raise rates in September. Fed officials have repeatedly warned that markets had too much confidence in the likely path of policy, given the central bank’s considerable uncertainty about its own plans. Ms. Yellen underscored the point with a chart showing that Fed officials thought rates could plausibly end 2017 anywhere from nearly zero to 4 percent.
business/economy,Yet she also stopped short of echoing other Fed officials who have suggested in recent weeks that they are inclined to raise rates in September. The Fed’s policy-making committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 20 and 21 in Washington. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said last week in Anchorage that a rate increase “makes good sense.” He repeated that point Thursday during an unusual meeting attended by 10 Fed policy makers and more than 100 activists brought to Jackson Hole by the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of community and labor groups pressing the central bank to postpone rate hikes. “It’s not about trying to stop the economy from growing,” Mr. Williams said, explaining his view that the economy no longer required quite as much help from the Fed. “We’re going to keep this economy growing; we are going to run it hot.” Yasenia Castro, a protester from Brooklyn, said at a demonstration before the meeting that she had not been able to find a full-time job since 2013. Ms. Castro, 35, has an associate degree in criminal justice and works weekends as a babysitter; she and her three children live with her mother to make ends meet. “If you’re a Fed official, and you think the economy has recovered, tell me why I’m still working as a babysitter when I have a degree,” Ms. Castro said.
business/economy,Fed officials said repeatedly that they sympathized with the protesters, but they added that pushing too hard to increase employment could be counterproductive if it led to a recession. Those struggling now would likely suffer most. “Everybody on this panel is painfully aware of what the costs of the last recession were and wants to avoid a future recession,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said during the Thursday meeting. Much of Ms. Yellen’s speech on Friday was devoted to the question of whether the central bank will be ready when the next recession inevitably comes. Even as the Fed moves to continue raising rates, officials expect that they will not rise nearly as much in the coming years as they did during previous periods of economic growth. That means the Fed will not be able to match the scale of the rate cuts it used to combat previous downturns. But Ms. Yellen said that the Fed in recent years had shown that other kinds of stimulus could also be effective. After cutting its benchmark rate to nearly zero, the Fed amplified the effect by promising to keep rates low. It also bought trillions of dollars in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates. “Even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively,” Ms. Yellen said.
business/economy,She cited a recent analysis by David Reifschneider, a Fed economist, that found that the central bank’s new set of tools would most likely be sufficient to compensate for the weakening of its traditional tool of lowering short-term interest rates. Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was “not actively considering” a range of other possible policy responses to a future crisis. These include buying assets other than Treasury securities, like municipal bonds, or raising the Fed’s inflation target above 2 percent. She also noted that fiscal policy makers could play a role in addressing any future crises. In particular, she said, the government should consider policies that might increase the productivity of the American work force. “Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise productivity growth,” Ms. Yellen said. Among the possibilities, she mentioned investment in education and infrastructure and reductions in regulation.
us/politics,Kennedy Asks to Alter Laws on His Successor  - The New York Times Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, terminally ill with brain cancer, has asked state legislative leaders to change the law and let Gov. Deval Patrick appoint a temporary replacement upon the senator’s death. Under current law, the seat would be vacant until a special election could be held 145 to 160 days later. But Senator Kennedy, a 77-year-old Democrat, wrote in a letter to the governor and leaders of the legislature that he wanted Massachusetts to have full representation in the Senate during that five-month period. Mr. Kennedy did not mention the issue in the letter, delivered Tuesday, but it is clear that Democratic votes will be crucial to passing the health care legislation that is the subject of intense Congressional debate. Mr. Kennedy has been a supporter of overhauling the health care system, but his absence from the debate and from public life in recent months has raised speculation that he will not be well enough to cast a vote when the time comes. Should Mr. Kennedy resign or die before then, it is rather likely that, under current law, his seat would still be vacant when the bill came up for a vote. Until 2004, state law called for the governor to appoint a temporary replacement if a Senate seat became vacant. But when Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, was running for president that year, the Democratic-controlled state legislature wanted to deny the governor at the time — Mitt Romney, a Republican — the power to name a successor if Mr. Kerry won.
us/politics,In his letter, Mr. Kennedy wrote that he supported the 2004 law, but he added, “I also believe it is vital for this Commonwealth to have two voices speaking for the needs of its citizens and two votes in the Senate during the approximately five months between a vacancy and an election.” Mr. Kennedy also asked that Mr. Patrick “obtain, as a condition of appointment of the interim Senator, an explicit personal commitment not to become a candidate in the special election.” Asked why Mr. Kennedy would not want a temporary appointee to run for his seat, Anthony Coley, a spokesman for Mr. Kennedy, said he “wanted to ensure that whomever received that appointment did not have any head start or advantage in the special election.” Mr. Coley also said that the timing of the letter had nothing to do with the state of Mr. Kennedy’s health, which he would not address. State Senator Robert A. O’Leary, a Democrat, said he would file legislation on Friday to change the law as Senator Kennedy wishes. “Here in Massachusetts, I think people will want to honor that request,” he said. “I think this improves what we did in 2004.” But it is unclear how many other lawmakers will support the proposal. Representative Thomas M. Petrolati, a Democrat and speaker pro tempore, voted for the change in 2004, and is not sure if it can be changed back. “I think we’re going to be hard-pressed as a legislative body to overturn a piece of legislation that people seemed to have wanted at the time,” Mr. Petrolati said.
us/politics,Officials in Washington said Thursday that White House representatives had been among those encouraging a change in the state law, hoping to prevent the prospect of a long Senate vacancy at what could be a crucial legislative period. The extraordinary effort to make certain that Mr. Kennedy’s seat will not sit empty for months showed the premium Democrats are placing on every single vote before consideration of difficult health care and perhaps climate change legislation. Though Democrats control 60 votes when independents from Connecticut and Vermont are counted, Mr. Kennedy has been absent from the Senate for nearly the entire session, while the frail health of Senator Robert C. Byrd, 91, Democrat of West Virginia, makes his availability for a vote very uncertain. That essentially would leave Democrats with 58 votes — two short of the 60 required to break Republican filibusters if Democrats stay united. Holding Senate Democrats as a solid bloc has proved challenging, however. No one in Massachusetts has publicly declared an interest in Mr. Kennedy’s seat, but several members of the United States House are likely to be interested, as is Martha Coakley, the state attorney general. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in a recent interview that Mr. Kennedy’s absence had hurt efforts to write bipartisan health legislation. “There’s no other Democrat who has that kind of swat right now,” Mr. Hatch said.
world/middleeast,A Timeline of Jews in Egypt - The New York Times Here is a timeline of the history of Jews in Egypt, based in part on information provided by Professor Joel Beinin of Stanford University, author of “The Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry.” Biblical Era: The Book of Exodus says that Moses led the Jews out of a period of captivity in Egypt, an event that forms the story of the founding of Israel. Around 1168 A.D.: Rabbi Moses Maimonides settles in Cairo’s Jewish community. 1882: The British occupy Egypt. 1922: King Fuad I establishes the British-backed Egyptian monarchy, now considered by some to have been a golden age of pluralism and cosmopolitanism. 1937: A census counts about 65,000 Egyptian Jews. 1947: A census counts about 75,000 Jews, and historians say that the number may have been closer to 85,000. 1948: Creation of the modern state of Israel; Egypt and the Arab states declare war against it. Over the next four years, about 20,000 Egyptian Jews leave the country. 1952: Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser leads a military takeover, overthrowing the monarchy. 1954: A group of Egyptian Jews recruited by Israel as spies try to bomb a series of Egyptian, American and British civilian targets after closing hours. Their goal was to create an image of instability to persuade the British to maintain their military occupation of the Suez Canal zone, but the plan failed. The episode was code-named Operation Susannah and became known as the Lavon Affair, after the Israeli defense minister, Pinhas Lavon, who was forced to resign.
world/middleeast,1956: Britain, France and Israel attack Egypt, in what became known as the Suez Crisis, or, in Egypt, as the Tripartite Aggression. After the attack, Nasser’s government arrests hundreds of Egyptian Jews on suspicion of spying for Israel and seizes hundreds of Jewish-owned businesses. Under government pressure, about 25,000 Jews leave Egypt, reducing their population to about 15,000. 1967: The war between Israel and the Arab states. About 12,000 Jews remain in Cairo. All Jewish men are arrested, then released, and the number of Jews continues to dwindle. At most, a few dozen Egyptian Jews remain today.

world/europe,A Ruling in Alexander Litvinenko’s Poisoning, but No Justice - The New York Times LONDON — Days after a British public inquiry linked President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to the fatal poisoning of her husband, Marina Litvinenko visited a cherished corner of Highgate Cemetery here. Someone, she said, had placed a bright bouquet of red roses on the grave in which Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer turned whistle-blower and Kremlin critic, has been buried since December 2006, after he was poisoned with the rare, expensive and highly toxic isotope polonium 210. Just before he died of radiation sickness, Ms. Litvinenko said in an interview, her husband “asked me to explain to people what happened to him,” and she agreed — a promise that took over nine years to fulfill in the face of official British opacity and dogged attempts in Russia to undermine her campaign. In that time, there were hard personal choices and legal tangles with some of the most senior officials in Prime Minister David Cameron’s government. Members of her husband’s family turned against her and denounced him as a traitor and a British spy. She risked going broke, and lawyers fought her case pro bono. Finally, on Jan. 21, Sir Robert Owen, a retired senior judge, delivered a 328-page report, blaming two Russian associates of Mr. Litvinenko for delivering the poison in a teapot, an operation described in the document as “probably” sanctioned by Mr. Putin. So was that the final word? Or even closure? Ms. Litvinenko thinks not.
world/europe,When she visited the graveside, “I said: Sasha, I have done it. But it is not the end.” Judge Owen’s findings have been dismissed, denied and ridiculed by the Kremlin and by the two men accused of administering the toxin, Andrei K. Lugovoi and Dmitri V. Kovtun. Against that backdrop, Ms. Litvinenko has a wish list of follow-ups. “First of all, Lugovoi and Kovtun to be sentenced. It would complete the criminal case,” she said, although the Kremlin has refused to extradite them. Then, she plans to seek redress at the European Court of Human Rights, and she has called for sanctions against members of the Kremlin elite. But, while the British government has announced that Mr. Lugovoi’s and Mr. Kovtun’s assets are to be frozen, its appetite for broader reprisals seems limited. Despite the temporary suspension of Syria peace talks in Geneva, The Economist said, “the Foreign Office is cautious about jeopardizing relations with the Kremlin,” even though “Russia has an entirely different agenda in Syria from that of Britain.” Moscow is a key patron of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a weighty factor in the realpolitik that has ensnared the Litvinenko case, particularly since Mr. Cameron came to power in 2010. Western strategies, of course, can be taken in several ways. Mr. Putin is ready to defy “international norms not because he is offended by the West’s assertiveness,” The Economist said, “but because he thinks it weak.” There are other sources of potential pressure, given the economic stake of wealthy Russians in London’s real estate and investment markets.
world/europe,Ultimately, one consequence may be a deepening of the already widespread belief that, as Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University, wrote in The Moscow Times, “if a Russian dies now, especially if in even faintly unexpected circumstances, everyone sees the Kremlin’s radioactive fingerprints on it.” There is the case, for instance, of Alexander Perepilichny, another Russian whistle-blower who was found dead in Britain in 2012 with traces of a rare toxin in his stomach. In the Litvinenko poisoning, Mr. Galeotti wrote, there was a “depressing irony.” “Moscow probably set out to kill a man and did it but has nothing to show for its ruthless ‘success,’ ” he wrote. “And in London, an inquiry set up to find the truth probably found it, but it is hard to know what London can do with that knowledge.”
nyregion,Stark Underground Space at World Trade Center Will Host a Riot of Ads - The New York Times Inch by inch, the new World Trade Center is being stripped of its connection to the World Trade Center that was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. Not without reason. Who would want to work or shop where 2,753 people were killed? The trident-shape columns so emblematic of the wreckage are housed in a glass pavilion that makes them hard to see from outside. The battered “Sphere” sculpture from the trade center plaza was moved to the Battery (though it may come back). Panels on a nearby pedestrian bridge that were damaged are being replaced. The latest erasure is occurring along the main wall of an east-west underground gallery that links Santiago Calatrava’s transportation hub to Battery Park City. Much of the wall follows the footprint of the original 1 World Trade Center, the first building to be hit by a hijacked jetliner during the attack. The footprint also defines the edge of the National September 11 Memorial’s north pool, which is about 25 feet behind the gallery wall. Until mid-March, the wall was a vast expanse of unadorned white marble. Pedestrians might not have understood its implicit symbolism. Yet its spartan solemnity seemed to acknowledge the power of what stood behind it. Now, a gigantic electronic billboard is taking over the wall.
nyregion,Gigantic. As long as the spire of nearby Trinity Church is high: 280 feet. Nine and a half feet tall. With an LED display operating at all hours. Sometimes it will be kinetic; sometimes static. Mercifully, it will always be silent. The billboard is part of Westfield World Trade Center, a luxury shopping mall that is to open in August in the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. The heart of the mall is Mr. Calatrava’s birdlike Oculus. Its underground limbs include the east-west gallery. Because the gallery opened to the public in 2013, well before retail tenants had set up shop, there have been years to appreciate it without any commercial veneer. But it was never intended to stay that way, the operators of Westfield World Trade Center said. “The digital signage network throughout the facility has always been part of the retail program,” the Westfield Corporation said in a statement. “The goal is to integrate physical and digital experiences across the facility.” As for the 280-foot-long sign, the Westfield statement said, “The objective is to create ‘moments of interest’ for those passing through the east-west gallery.” How can the public reflect on history looking at a wall ablaze with advertising, store promotions, and arts, culture, news and information programs? Isn’t that disrespectful? Westfield does not think so. “Westfield is a partner of the September 11 Memorial and Museum foundation and has deep respect for the site and its history,” the company said in its statement. “There will be no digital media (no screens or other signage) facing the memorial and Westfield has been and will remain sensitive to the memorial.”
nyregion,And yet. At street level, the footprints of the original trade center towers are treated reverently. They define the edges of the memorial’s twin pools. They are the frames around which the names of victims are inscribed. At bedrock level, they are treated respectfully. Clad in shimmering aluminum, the footprints help visitors to the National September 11 Memorial Museum orient themselves and understand where the buildings stood. In the gallery between those levels, however, one edge of the 1 World Trade Center footprint will now be the backdrop for a high-energy marketing device. Mr. Calatrava’s renderings of the hub do not show any advertising on the scale of the billboard. Though he has said nothing publicly, it would be hard to imagine that he is not frustrated by Westfield’s plans for signage. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built the gallery, cares principally that the billboard not show explicit political or sexual material. (The two are frequently confused.) The agency can veto “content,” Westfield said, but that issue is not expected to arise. The nonprofit National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation does not object to the billboard. In fact, the foundation said it may collaborate with Westfield on the “content” shown on digital screens elsewhere in the hub during the annual commemorative period in September. Somewhere under all that content, something real will have been lost.
opinion,Testing Europe’s Conscience - The New York Times After the drowning of more than 300 Africans near the Italian island of Lampedusa, the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, pledged 30 million euros, or about $40.7 million, last week to help Italy deal with an overwhelming influx of refugees. While this is a good start, it is far from enough. On Friday, another boat carrying more than 200 refugees capsized off the coast of Sicily, leaving more than 30 people dead. Over the past two decades, 20,000 migrants have died trying to make it across the Mediterranean to Europe’s shores. According to Frontex, the European agency charged with managing Europe’s borders, 73,000 migrants illegally crossed Europe’s borders in 2012 and 115,000 more were turned away. Most flee political turmoil and economic collapse at home, with thousands seeking refuge in Europe after regime change in Tunisia, the war in Libya and, most recently, the conflict in Syria. These numbers have spawned organized criminal networks that prey upon desperate refugees. Increased migration has been exploited by far-right political parties to fan fears of refugees as threats to living standards and national identities. Polls last week showed that, ahead of French municipal elections, there was record-breaking levels of voter support for National Front, the far-right party led by Marine Le Pen.
opinion,To prevent more tragedies, the European Commission proposes expanding search-and-rescue operations by Frontex. Such a move would need additional funding from European Union members, which may prove a political challenge. Equally challenging is breaking up the human-trafficking networks and providing aid to those who qualify under immigration law to stay in Europe and arranging for humane repatriation for those who do not. It is cruel to impose, as does Italian law, stiff fines and deportation on survivors of human trafficking. President François Hollande of France says he will discuss migration policies with European leaders this month. The international community could help by offering more refugees sanctuary beyond Europe’s borders. Europe alone cannot deal with the consequences of war and repressive regimes in Africa and the Middle East. The tragedy near Lampedusa is more than an European tragedy. It is a human tragedy.
technology,European Publishers Play Lobbying Role Against Google - The New York Times BERLIN —  In private sessions this summer, giant publishers and media companies from Germany, France and elsewhere have met with European officials about proposals to regulate Europe’s digital economy. The discussions have covered a broad range of contentious issues, according to public disclosures and several people who attended or were briefed on the meetings. Central to almost all of them has been limiting the reach of a single American company: Google. The company has a long list of detractors crying foul about how it operates in Europe, including rivals like Microsoft and Yelp. But as Europeans take a lead globally in regulating the Internet and containing American tech companies, the Continent’s old media — influential newspaper and magazine publishers — are emerging as one of Google’s most persistent adversaries. With Google attracting attention and ad revenue that once funneled to publishers, the goal is clear: Find ways to make more money, by strengthening copyright rules and limiting Google’s power as an advertising platform. The publishers, including Axel Springer of Germany and Lagardère of France, arguably have the most to lose from the dominance of Google and other West Coast companies, as they look for revenue on the web to replace losses in print. Some of the publishers, in an effort to buttress their business, have even turned to e-commerce and social networking — areas that have intensified the rivalry with Google and other tech companies.
technology,“Where else can they go if print is dying?” asked Lucy Küng, a visiting fellow and specialist in digital transition at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. The newspaper and magazine publishers first focused on Europe’s continuing antitrust investigation into whether Google favored its own services over those of rivals. They are now broadening their goals in ways that would further cramp Google’s reach, according to several industry executives and tech lobbyists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the efforts. “Newspapers help set the agenda, so politicians have to listen to them,” said Julia Reda, a German politician who helped shepherd recent digital copyright proposals through the European Parliament. The push has awakened Google’s powerful lobbying apparatus, setting off a clash in Brussels and elsewhere in the region as the company tries to co-opt some of its media adversaries and hamstring more stubborn rivals. Google and some other giant American tech companies already confront strong regulatory headwinds in Europe. Apple, Amazon and Facebook are all facing antitrust, tax and privacy investigations across the 28-member bloc. If Google is found to have broken the rules, it could face billions of dollars in fines. Google formally responded on Thursday to the accusations, saying its search products did not harm online competition and providing data that the company said showed that rivals had not been harmed.
technology,“We believe that Google increases choice for European consumers and offers valuable opportunities for businesses of all sizes,” Kent Walker, the company’s general counsel, wrote in a blog post. In recent weeks, several trade associations, including the Federation of European Publishers, have met with Friedrich Wenzel Bulst, a top European antitrust official, and other regulators to also push for stricter, Europe-wide limits on how Google and others may use publishers’ online content. Many publishers are pushing the rules as part of an expected overhaul of copyright policy from Günther Oettinger, a European commissioner with ties to Germany’s publishing industry, by the end of the year. If the rules are approved, Google may eventually have to pay newspaper and magazine groups whenever links to their content are shown on Google’s European aggregation sites. Similar copyright rules already have been passed in several European countries, but have so far backfired against the publishers. In Germany, Google removed many local organizations from its news service, which led to a drastic fall in online traffic to some newspapers’ sites. Local publishers eventually agreed to waive any potential charges. “The argument is simple enough: Publishers want money from Google,” said Till Kreutzer, a German lawyer who has campaigned against these new copyright proposals. “Many European politicians are open to listening to that type of proposal.”
technology,Over the last five years, print circulation for Europe’s newspaper industry has fallen a combined 21.3 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in the United States, according to the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers, a trade body. The publishers have pushed to expand readership on computers and mobile devices. But because audiences in Europe are fragmented along national and linguistic borders, the potential is often limited. “They can’t expand endlessly internationally because of the language issue,” Ms. Küng said of Europe’s publishers. “Just acquiring other assets with the same problems is really just compounding the problem. The issue is monetizing content.” “They have followed the eyeballs and the wallets,” she added. “I don’t see it as inconsistent.” The sums that publishers are spending to lobby against Google are unclear; disclosures about spending on lobbying in Europe are voluntary, leaving a weak money trail. According to official records, Axel Springer, a German publisher whose flagship Bild tabloid is the highest-circulation newspaper in Europe, spent up to $55,000 on Brussels-based lobbying last year; the European Publishers Council, a trade body with close ties to Axel Springer, spent up to $555,000. Yet the effort is broad-based, involving written and personal appeals to European Union officials and national lawmakers by dozens of publishers’ groups from at least 20 countries, including Switzerland, which is not a member of the European Union, according to European officials who have either met with industry representatives or seen the correspondence. The moves go well beyond steps taken by American media outlets to contain Silicon Valley’s power.
technology,“This is not about protecting the legacy business,” said Christoph Keese, executive vice president at Axel Springer and a vocal critic of Google. “It is about ensuring there is a level playing field and making sure that international companies respect European laws.” Google has fought hard against the lobbying and investigations. The company tripled its spending on lobbying in Brussels last year, spending at least $4.8 million in 2014, according to its European disclosure report. Eric Schmidt, the company’s executive chairman, met with Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official, before her decision this year to bring formal antitrust charges. Other company officials have held meetings with national politicians to outline how Google can bolster countries’ often flagging economies, according to several government officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Google has tried to woo magazine and newspaper groups, partly by creating a $172 million fund aimed at helping publishers adapt to the digital world. (The International New York Times, which is based in Paris, took part in a previous $65 million fund that Google created in France.) The company’s executives also regularly point out that Google sends millions of daily visitors to European newspapers and magazines through its online news aggregation service. Those links — which can represent up to half of a newspaper’s online traffic — generate much-needed online revenue for publishers.
technology,“We recognize that technology companies and news organizations are part of the same information ecosystem,” David C. Drummond, Google’s senior vice president for corporate development, told an audience of media executives in Barcelona in June. “We are committed to playing our part.” A Google spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Drummond’s remarks. Newspaper groups and other publishing associations were some of the earliest supporters of the antitrust case against Google, the company’s most pressing issue in Europe. The more prominent antagonists, though, were Microsoft and other tech rivals, according to publishing executives and other company officials involved in the case. That dynamic began to change early last year, when Joaquín Almunia, Europe’s competition chief at the time, signaled he was prepared to settle with Google, these people said. Google’s opponents looked for another avenue to press their case, leaning harder on their well-connected publishing allies for help. Over the course of last summer, representatives from newspaper and magazine industries, as well as Brussels-based trade associations, met several times with Mr. Almunia and his staff to ask them to renounce the settlement, according to industry executives who were either present or briefed on those meetings. “There were enormously long exchanges, and some pretty strong representations made” by top publishing industry executives to Mr. Almunia, said one lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “The companies felt they were being served a settlement that was actually going to be injurious to their business.”
technology,The rift between publishers and Google became most public in April 2014 in an open letter by Mathias Döpfner, Axel Springer’s chief executive. Mr. Döpfner, writing to Mr. Schmidt of Google, criticized the tech company’s perceived dominance of many aspects of how people — and other companies — use online services. “We are afraid of Google,” Mr. Döpfner said in his letter. “Our business relationship is that of the Goliath of Google to the David of Axel Springer.” Even Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, whose European interests include the British newspapers The Times and The Sun and The Wall Street Journal Europe, joined the fray, urging the European Commission last fall to take action against Google, which it labeled a “platform for piracy.” Europe’s publishers also took the fight to national capitals, industry executives said, asking governments to put pressure on Mr. Almunia to rethink the proposed settlement. By early September, Mr. Almunia officially rejected the settlement with Google after significant lobbying from both publishing groups and other companies connected to the case. Mr. Almunia left the investigation to his successor, Ms. Vestager, who announced antitrust charges against Google in April. Many publishers backed the move, saying the company’s business model had limited online choice for consumers. “Europe’s publishers are well organized, well connected and a really powerful lobby,” said Stefan Heumann, director of the European digital agenda program at the New Responsibility Foundation, a Berlin-based research organization. “Many of them are struggling to grasp the realities of the new digital world.”
business,Liz Rodbell on Taking the Time to Recognize Success - The New York Times This interview with Liz Rodbell, president of Lord & Taylor and Hudson’s Bay department stores, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. Q. Were you in leadership roles or doing entrepreneurial things when you were younger?  A. I grew up in Springfield, Mass., and from a very early age, I was interested in fashion. As soon as I could get a job, I was working in stores, engaging with customers. My first job was selling shoes. I also sold jewelry and worked in some local department stores. How have your parents influenced your leadership style? My father started his career as an industrial engineer in the steel industry. His second career was in management consulting. My mother was a schoolteacher. I had this very strong culture of work and career at a very early age, and lots of room for independence for my brothers and me. We were taught to believe that if you put your mind to do it, you could do it — the world is your oyster, but you’ve got to make it happen. And they were always in our corner. That meant a lot to me, and I use that line a lot today with my team — “I’m in your corner.” We’re in this together to make things happen. Other lessons from your parents?
business,My mother was always very prepared and knew her material for school. But at the same time, she was open to learning all the time, whether it was taking courses or learning from others. That’s something I pride myself on — I have a vision and a strategy, but at the same time, I always want to be open to learning from others. My father played football in college and was recruited by the Giants to play professionally. I learned how to catch a football before I rode a bike. But he really felt that he had a longer career opportunity using his math mind rather than playing football. I also learned from him the concept of playing to win and understanding the offense and defense of the business world. I also use a lot of football analogies. In retail, you can have a great long-term strategy, but you also have to have the ability to adjust in the huddle and redirect energy. Do you remember when you first became a manager? I was about 22 years old. I was right out of college, and I was managing associates who were twice my age. It was an interesting challenge — showing them respect but also coaching them to do more. So I tried to get to know them personally, rather than just coming in and expecting them to do what I say. I was always very driven, and I had a point of view of what salesmanship qualities I was looking for. But it was getting to know them personally that helped with the age gap.
business,What were some other early leadership lessons for you? There are two things that came from my parents that have been reinforced over my career. The behavior seems so simple, but it’s the importance of saying “thank you,” and taking the time to recognize people’s successes. Saying thank you is not hard, but not everybody does it. It helps the whole team. When you mentor people, what advice do you typically give them? If I’m coaching somebody on how to have a challenging conversation with somebody on their team or a vendor partner, my advice is always to be honest and candid and direct. And you have to make sure people understand why you’re having the conversation, so they know where you’re coming from. And you have to ask questions of the person, too, so that you understand their point of view and it’s a dialogue. I also tell everybody that this is a very fast industry, and you have to make decisions and keep moving. But sometimes the right decision is not to decide right away. You can say, “My decision is to put that one to the side for now.” Take the moment to make a good judgment, then make the decision and move on to the next one. How do you hire?
business,I want somebody who’s really smart but also very driven and can work with people. So I try to have the candidate tell me stories about themselves and their experiences of how they dealt with challenges. I want to know who their favorite boss was, and why. I also ask why they want to be here. That goes a long way in telling me why this is the right place for them and how committed they are. Do you have any pet peeves beyond the obvious ones? We’re in a lot of meetings, and they’re very purposeful and we have agendas. If somebody isn’t listening and following the trail of where we are in the conversation, I get annoyed. When we run a meeting, we expect people to speak up, and if they don’t understand something, they should ask about it. And sometimes new executives want to prove themselves a bit. But you’re on the team. You’re hired. You’re in. So you don’t have to do that. I also expect quick responses to email. If I don’t even get an “I’ll get back to you” or a “Got it” or something, I’m unsure if the message got through. So I do expect follow-up. I’m very busy and I want to be connected to make sure that we keep moving. What career and life advice do you give to new college grads? People should get out there and just get experience if they don’t know exactly what they want to do. Just try it on and see what fits. Be open to what the possibilities are and don’t close doors.
business,Some people don’t think networking is as important as they should. But you can reach out to people and say, “How did your career start? What did you do? How did you find your way? How has it evolved?” People are very willing to help if you just ask them.
us,After Backing Trump, Christians Who Fled Iraq Fall Into His Dragnet - The New York Times STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. — A few Sundays ago, federal immigration agents walked through the doors of handsome houses here in the Detroit suburbs, brushing past tearful children, stunned wives and statuettes of the Virgin Mary in search of men whose time was up. If the Trump administration prevails, more than 100 of these men may soon be deported, like the tens of thousands of other people rounded up this year as part of a national clampdown on illegal immigration. But the arrests may have stunned this community more than most. While President Trump was hurling verbal napalm at Mexico and vowing to keep out Muslims during his campaign, he was also promising to look out for people from these men’s besieged corner of the world. They are Christians from Iraq — a land that they and their families fled decades ago because, they say, to live as a Christian in Iraq is no life at all, and sometimes means death. They settled in Detroit and its suburbs, accumulating into what may now be the largest population of Chaldean Christians in the world. They opened businesses, founded a dozen Chaldean Catholic churches and rose in numbers and wealth. Even so, they, too, are subject to American immigration law — despite what the Chaldean community took to be an ironclad promise from a president whose election many of them saw as a miracle from God, helped along by their donations, their prayers and blessings from religious leaders.
us,“Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter in January, returning to a campaign-trail refrain that had captured Chaldean hearts and ballots across this stretch of Macomb and Oakland Counties. As the Chaldeans like to say, once with pride, now with fury, the area helped tip Michigan to Mr. Trump in November. Soon after the June 11 immigration raids, a local Chaldean noted the disconnect between tweet and deed. “Then why are you deporting them?” he wrote on Twitter, bracketing the question with a snarl of English, Aramaic and Arabic that would be unprintable in any language. “Everyone thought this could not apply to us,” said Nadine Yousif, a lawyer with CODE Legal Aid, a local organization coordinating the community’s response to the raids. The immigration authorities give the same explanation they have given for the arrests of tens of thousands of Latinos and other immigrants without legal status since Mr. Trump took office: These people, too, are what the government refers to as “criminal aliens.” Though most of them came here legally, as refugees or through relatives who were American citizens, their green cards were revoked after criminal convictions on charges including theft, drug possession, rape and murder. “The operation in this region was specifically conducted to address the very real public safety threat represented by the criminal aliens arrested,” said Rebecca Adducci, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in Detroit.
us,The men had been allowed to stay, in some cases for decades, because the Iraqi government had refused to issue travel documents for them to return. That changed in March, when Iraq agreed to begin accepting deportees in exchange for being dropped from the list of countries affected by Mr. Trump’s revised travel ban, which barred citizens of several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Mr. Trump “broke his promise,” said Nahrain Hamama, 54, whose husband has been detained. If the administration reverses course, however, “then I would consider voting for him again,” she added. Besides the 114 Iraqis arrested around Detroit, immigration agents have also picked up 85 Iraqis in other parts of the country since May, including Shiite Muslims and members of other religious and ethnic groups, such as Kurds and Yazidis. A federal judge in Michigan last week blocked the government from deporting any of them for two weeks while he weighs whether he has the authority to hear their immigration cases. The Iraqis argue that near-certain torture or even death awaits them in Iraq, where the Islamic State has targeted Christians, Shiites and other religious groups. Arabic-language news channels and social media regularly bring word of ancestral villages razed, Christian cemeteries shattered and Chaldean churches shuttered. Though their villages were recently liberated, most Christians have stayed away out of fear, taking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.
us,Chaldeans, who practice Eastern Rite Catholicism, descend from the ancient Assyrians of what is now northern Iraq, where they are increasingly rare. Since 2007, nearly 30,000 Chaldeans have poured into the Detroit area, following waves of Iraqi Christian arrivals that began early in the last century and intensified after Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. The number of Christians in Iraq has tumbled from about 1.4 million in 1987 to an estimated 250,000 last year, leaders of the community in the Detroit area said. Many of the Michigan Chaldeans speak little or no Arabic. Tattoos of the Virgin Mary and crosses stipple their shoulders and wrists. “The second they step foot out of the airport,” after deportation to Iraq, “they’re targets,” said Wisam Naoum, a lawyer turned community activist. Chaldeans had written off the Obama administration because of what they saw as its failure to accept more Iraqi Christian refugees. But Mr. Trump’s original travel ban, issued in January, offered an implicit exception for Christians in the Middle East, allowing persecuted religious minorities to enter as refugees even as it barred people from Muslim-majority countries. (When Mr. Trump revised the travel ban, he dropped the exception in an attempt to neutralize lawsuits claiming that the ban discriminated against Muslims. The Supreme Court agreed last week to hear the case.) It took only a day of arrests for Detroit’s Chaldeans to lurch from security to panic.
us,“We anticipated they’d be picking up the worst of the worst,” said Martin Manna, the president of the Chaldean Community Foundation, a social services organization, where even citizens and green card holders are calling to ask if they should worry. “Not people like Sam Hamama.” Usama Hamama, 54, a partner in a local supermarket who goes by Sam, was getting ready for church with his wife and four children when immigration agents knocked on the door of his spacious home in a quiet West Bloomfield subdivision. He had just enough time to collect his medications and say goodbye before being taken into custody. Mr. Hamama, who arrived in the United States from Baghdad when he was 11, was convicted of a weapons possession charge after he flashed an unloaded gun during a road-rage confrontation with another driver in 1988. He was ordered deported in 1994. His children view him differently. “I would never use the word ‘felon’ or ‘criminal’ or ‘alien’ for my dad,” said Britanny Hamama, 20, his eldest child. Like many other Chaldeans, his wife was drawn to Mr. Trump by his opposition to abortion, his economic message and his promises of succor for Christians in the Middle East. But she could not bring herself to vote after Mr. Hamama warned her that their family could be snarled in Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown. Another detainee, Najah Konja, was checking his emails over a cup of coffee on his back porch, looking out over the pond out back, when the doorbell sounded on June 11.
us,Mr. Konja, who goes by Nick, fled Iraq with his family at age 15, and later served 22 years in federal prison for selling cocaine. His green card was revoked, but since he could not be deported, he was able to stay, rise up the ranks at a chain of tobacco stores called Wild Bill’s, become engaged and buy a house. Unlike some other ex-felons, he said, he had bettered himself and contributed to the local economy. “I wasn’t born here, but I’m more American than them,” said Mr. Konja, 55, speaking by phone from a jail in Port Huron, Mich. Still, Mr. Konja and his family do not blame Mr. Trump. “A lot of this stuff, it probably doesn’t even get to his desk,” he said. For other families, the separation from fathers and husbands has forced them into a rueful reckoning: The immigration crackdown they had always associated with other people had, somehow, leapt from the southern border to their subdivisions. “What’s the difference between a Mexican and a Chaldean?” said Nicole Sabatine, whose husband, Atheer Fawzi Ali, 41, was detained in June. “When people, Mexicans, whatever, have kids here, taking their parent away is not the answer.” Mr. Ali’s family fled Iraq in the early 1990s after his father, an army officer, defied an order from Saddam Hussein. He lost his green card after breaking into a car as a teenager. That Sunday in June, he had just enough time to say goodbye to his 12-year-old daughter, Natalia, before turning himself in.
us,“I’ll always be there for you,” he told her. “Even if I’m in Iraq.”

travel,Mariane Pearl: Revisiting the Cuba of My Youth - The New York Times My cousin Julia’s porch in Havana is bare, except for three plastic chairs and a bench, but her front yard is a local hot spot where everyday life unfolds. On my last visit there, our gaze fell on a skinny man with green eyes and skin the color of dark chocolate sucking on an avocado seed as he eavesdropped on a shouting match between a couple of chess players. Another man, gaptoothed and wearing a baseball cap, came along to loudly mock them all. This joyous and endless cacophony amid the incomparable Cuban soundtrack of salsa music, the frantic crowing of a rooster and the barking of more dogs than I can count was music to my ears. A satisfying journey to Cuba for me involves dedicating time to giving in to my surroundings. So I settled in eagerly for the magic realism that is Julia’s life. When I saw my cousin, Julia Niurka Mesa, two summers ago, we lounged on her cinder-block porch and I savored what it felt like to stay at her home — less concerned than ever before about Cuba’s prying security apparatus. President Raúl Castro of Cuba was already opening up the country: allowing small private businesses, easing some restrictions between Cubans and foreigners. The changes would culminate in the historic surprise announcement in December 2014 that Cuba and the United States planned to resume diplomatic relations for the first time in a half century. President Obama acknowledged that “50 years of isolation” didn’t work. From where we sat, Julia and I couldn’t have agreed more.
travel,My cousin lives in Nuevo Vedado, a neighborhood near the town center of Havana, with its decaying and majestic colonial buildings and the Malecón, the broad seaside esplanade, roadway and sea wall, beaten by waves of white foam at high tide. In their aging splendor, these landmarks are reminders of a time when Havana, with its glittering waterfront, was the regional capital of gambling, sex and large orchestras. In Fidel Castro’s Communist Cuba, the glitter is long gone, replaced by an absorbing pattern of multicolored weathered facades, which, taken together, have the beauty of an Impressionist painting. The casinos and other elegant venues have been replaced by a multitude of bars and restaurants with their trio of elderly musicians, playing the same tired repertoire of traditional country songs, like broken records. The government for so long has allowed visitors to feast their eyes on what it has wanted them to see. But Cuba is changing fast. I hear that rich foreigners, among them Canadians and Russians, are buying the grand Cuban mansions. My cousin’s neighborhood remains a kind of time capsule of the Cuba that I have come to love. Before too long, though, visitors may pine for a glimpse of the everyday Cuba that spills forth from rough-hewed porches like the one that fronts Julia’s modest-size home.
travel,I breathe in Cubanía, the mesmerizing vitality, sensuality and ready sense of humor that make up the identity of the people of this island nation. The culture runs in my blood. My mother was an Afro-Cuban who fell in love with my Dutch-French father, one of the first foreign professionals to join Fidel Castro’s revolution, teaching mathematics at Havana University. They met at the famous Hotel Habana Libre, formerly the Habana Hilton, Mr. Castro’s stronghold during the early years of the Cuban Revolution. This is where my father invited my mother and her two cousins over to his table for a drink. By the end of the evening, he gave the cousins each a rose; my mother, a kiss. My parents’ love affair bloomed, but not their romance with Mr. Castro’s revolution, and they left Cuba in 1966 after the birth of my older brother. The laws regulating foreign interaction with Cuban people including my family members have been as unpredictable as the weather. I have been visiting Cuba since I was 9 and I have seen it through rough and sad times. During the early 1990s, when Cuba’s gross domestic product plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall, my mother would prepare for our trips from Paris to Cuba by packing bras, soap and food. The toilet paper she took for her own mother was promptly displayed on the empty shelves of my grandmother’s home without a hint of irony. For the longest time, even with my French passport, my travels there were viewed with suspicion by Cuban authorities. (I was also a journalist.) When buying an airline ticket there, like any French citizen, I was required to make a reservation in a government-run hotel for the length of my stay. But things are shifting in ways that I once would have thought unimaginable.
travel,“Can you feel the dead rocking in their graves?” I asked Julia on the phone in December, after President Obama and President Raúl Castro announced the détente between their two countries. I was thinking of my parents, both now dead. My mother was not allowed to return to Cuba until 1989 because everyone who left was considered a traitor. Julia, I knew, thought of her father, my Tio Pepe, who fled Cuba for America on the Mariel boat lift, never to see her again. “I have prepared for this all my life,” Julia told me, her voice filled with emotion. A proud and defiant woman, Julia wears her identity like a flag but politics are far from her mind. “I am in love with the idiosyncrasy of my people,” she said. Julia’s neighborhood, previously ignored by tourists, despite its proximity to the city center, is now a treasure trove of guesthouses, actually family homes that have one room set aside for guests. Built in the 1930s, the neighborhood was populated by well-to-do Cubans who built an array of California-style houses with small patios. Today, Julia’s narrow street has deeply pocked sidewalks reminiscent of a lunar landscape. Roots of banana and avocado trees grasp the uneven concrete like oversize hands. Yet the neighborhood feels welcoming and pretty with residents’ chairs lined up on the sidewalk. When the temperature cools, people settle outside to watch the great show of daily life as if it were a television series.
travel,The number of residents far exceeds the available accommodations so the street serves as a live-in extension with neighbors enjoying the shade and the aromatic fragrance of tropical flowers. Behind Julia’s house are intricate pathways and courtyards where smaller houses have been built, inhabited by families of eight or nine people. Yet even in such crowded quarters, it is sensuality that most permeates all things, from the drops of sweat on coppery skin to the beauty of the scarlet papayas to the Cuban women, who move their bodies, sculpted or not, with an unmistakable confidence. On this day, Julia was giving me the lowdown on Nuevo Vedado. With one hand taming her helmet of unruly hair, she pointed to the woman who lives directly across the street. Dalia is a single mother, she said, a military corporal and the local president of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. Fidel Castro had proclaimed that the committees are “a collective system of revolutionary vigilance,” established “so that everybody knows who lives on every block, what they do on every block, what relations they have had with the tyranny, in what activities are they involved, and with whom they meet.” But nobody goes to the committee meetings anymore, Julia said. Two or three years before, that same weary, uniformed woman would have reported me to the authorities as a foreigner staying on the block. My family in Cuba would then be questioned and questioned some more by authorities. Now, I looked at Dalia, ignoring me. Standing at her window in her cinder-block home, she seemed lost in thought, her gaze following a sinewy young man who cheerfully threw a beer can over his shoulder.
travel,“Market economy,” Julia said with a chuckle a bit later, nodding toward an old man who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, his wrinkles spreading like sun rays around his tiny beady eyes. He held a large plastic bag filled with empty cans. The government began laying off a half-million employees in 2010, saying the state payroll was bloated with inefficiency, and subsequently expanded permits for small private businesses in an attempt to allow former civil servants to build a private sector from scratch. Rogelio, the old man, said that he makes a dollar a day recycling cans and that he pays a modest tax to the state. Grabbing my arm with his long, skinny fingers he gave me the biggest toothless smile: “We recycle everything here, everything but the government.” And cracking up at his own recycled joke he moved on to find the next can. During my monthlong stay with Julia in August 2013, I met José, who drives people around for a living. He told me he paces inside his house for exercise for an hour every day at twilight. “I close all the windows,” he said, “so the neighbors don’t think I am crazy.” At the local market, Julia introduced me to Silvio, the shoemaker who lives down the street and put together his initial capital “with whatever disappeared” from the leather factory where he used to work, a veiled reference to the petty theft in a country that for the longest time lacked basic goods such as toothpaste and toilet paper.
travel,A few hundred meters away, a rural working train station doubles as a family’s house. Trains go by so slowly that passengers can enjoy the sight of a dangling set of faded underwear drying on the clothes line outside the station. Later, I met an elderly man who introduced himself as a freedom fighter. He said he fought the guerrilla war with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara when Cuba was ruled “like a giant brothel.” Ancient and rail-thin, the man seemed lost in reverie as he recalled the nights spent in the Sierra Maestra where he hid with the other revolutionaries: illiterate young men driven by the ideal of social justice. The old guerrillero in civilian clothes paused to slowly chew the mixture of corn, rice and chickpeas he eats every day at the retirees’ canteen behind Julia’s block. He recalled the mosquitoes that tormented them nightly in the mountains and how he feared for his life. Now, he looked like a caricature of Cuban history, a relic, just like the giant billboards praising “socialism or death.” The world defined by the Barbudos, the bearded rebels, is still very much on display to the delight of visitors who go to Cuba to experience a journey back in time and history: the slogans (“Ready to die for our ideals”); the flirty old musicians; and the country’s weakness for uniforms, like the schoolgirls in short skirts and the young military trainees in tight fatigues.
travel,At the corner of Julia’s street is the convenient vegetable store that is the subject of much conversation on the block. The morning produce arrival could be something big or very little. It may be sweet potatoes, onions or fruit like a bundle of mangoes. The place is run by the Madman. His real name is Arturo and he has been managing the vegetable store, which looks like an abandoned warehouse, for more years than he can remember. “Why do they call you loco?” I asked him. “Because I am crazy to get out of here!” he answered, roaring in laughter. An antique cobalt blue Pontiac cruised by like a mirage, skirting around a giant pothole, complementing the worn beauty of the colorful buildings. El Loco looked suddenly nostalgic. He pointed a dirt-stained finger toward a nearby avenue, where a bus, with passengers hanging like bunches of grapes on its sides, was lumbering by in a dark cloud of toxic fumes. “This, love, is revolution,” he said enigmatically. Cubans nonchalantly crossed the road everywhere except at the traffic light. Farther away, I spotted a diminutive man with a large straw hat walking with a pig on a leash. “Bread!” shouted someone in the street and El Loco’s customers were gone, rushing toward the bread vendor who broke into a spontaneous song about crusts, the bread of life and the cry of empty stomachs. I sense that the humor is perhaps a defense mechanism, along with national pride and the fine national rum, for Cubans in Cuba who have sat on their porches all these years.
travel,As I soaked in the goings-on of my cousin’s neighborhood, I would see Julia often turn to smile her knowing, quizzical grin. Even in the summer of 2013, change seemed somehow on the horizon. I felt as if Julia and I had run a marathon through time and history, to land there together on her porch of broken mosaic tiles. There had been years when Julia wasn’t allowed to enter the government-owned hotels where I was required to stay (I was a French citizen, and would acquire an American citizenship later.) Sometimes, she could come to the room but the police would knock on my door and ask probing questions. They wanted to know who I was and why I looked Cuban but not quite. We would play at confusing them when they asked questions, letting them assume that we were both Cubans. When I started speaking, they would realize I was a foreigner. We felt a small triumph at their shame and confusion. Then, there was the time in 1998, when I took Julia to one of those state-run restaurants for foreigners only, set inside an old colonial house, enveloped by bright flowering plants with large, swaying leaves. It was like dining in the middle of a jungle. Cuba exports lobsters but Julia had never tasted them nor ever fancied she would. But there we were. I had foreign currency; she had Cuban pesos. I was the privileged one; she was a local who didn’t own anything. The meat, though tender and buttery, left a bitter aftertaste for both of us. We felt segregated from each other.
travel,Julia and I are the same age, 47. She looks like a striking replica of my mother — the caramel-colored skin, round face and wide, warm smile. She is also an expert at operating the Cuban system. When I first saw her in 1997, she was behind bars at a women’s prison outside Havana, incarcerated under corruption charges for which she was eventually pronounced not guilty. She has tried her hand at selling handmade dresses. She has worked in factories and was sent many times to a rural camp to do so-called voluntary work for which she was given no choice, sawing tobacco leaves by hand. Nowadays, she is running a small business offering lunch (rice, plenty of it, black beans, pork, thinly sliced, and avocado) to students, workers and medical doctors from Nuevo Vedado, which is close to the main zoo. Even though the menu seldom varies, my cousin’s lunches are sought after in the neighborhood. One of her most faithful customers is the manager of the government convenience store who is in charge of delivering the rationed food distributed through the government supply booklet. The coupon book, a trademark of Fidel Castro’s revolution, establishes the rations each person is allowed to buy through that system, and the frequency of supplies. The local manager serves 861 families and everyone calls him El Gordo. He is a middle-aged man with feline green eyes and dimples that make him look like a large baby.
travel,“Do you mind people calling you ‘Fatty’?” I asked him. “And what else are they going to call me, ‘Love’? Matter of fact, I am fat!” he roared back. But on the day of our visit El Gordo said he wasn’t feeling too well. He had drunk a mouthful of hydrochloric acid, mistaking it for rum, and his mouth and abdomen felt as if they were on fire. “I am glad I don’t drink,” I said. El Gordo turned to my cousin, flabbergasted, and pointed a fat thumb at me. “And what exactly does she live for?” he asked. A pale, skinny woman in her 60s showed up to pick up her allotted ration of rice. I inquired about meat delivery that day. “Meat? What meat?” she responded, causing the other customers waiting in line to crack up. El Gordo showed me the rationed meat: It was pink, gooey, and I would swear I saw something moving in it. El Gordo called out to a young woman as she passed by in a sexy white blouse and slacks, her blond hair flowing in the tropical breeze: “You’re so beautiful, it hurts,” he said, still holding the scoop of meat, his mouth still burning. The old woman gave him a plastic bag for the meat. So it looked as if she was going to cook it.
travel,As we walked the neighborhood, Julia explained that we were on a meal-delivery tour reserved for special clients. Along the way, we came across a gregarious man with green eyes and curly hair who was about to undergo open-heart surgery that afternoon and confided that he couldn’t wait to have sex again. At the end of a dirt road, Julia showed me the local gym, entirely hand-built. Out came Silvio, a brawny, handsome man in his 40s with chiseled features and, in the rainbow range of Cuban skin tones, the color of mahogany. Covered in plaster and dust, he was a construction worker though he trained as a military nuclear engineer specializing in weaponry, a field where thankfully there isn’t enough work. We ended our tour with 94-year-old Manuela, who lives two doors down from Julia’s house. She still works as a part-time fortune teller, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. She said that spirits and dead souls come through her to talk to the living. In my session with her I saw her shake when she was “visited.” The trembling stopped immediately afterward, and it all looked pretty genuine. As she read her tarot cards and little seashells, the old woman became glassy-eyed. She told me that I was going to be well and that I should not cut my hair; it was an important part of my charm.
travel,That night, Julia and I took some friends to the makeshift 3D movie theater nestled in the bushes right by a garage with a carcass of a 1957 Mercedes. Hidden by banana trees, the little house with a neon cinema sign had been sealed off, its windows darkened. A large-screen plasma TV and three rows of wooden benches were waiting for customers. The theater offered mostly horror films, but we chose to reserve “Men in Black 3.” The family that ran the operation charged us one U.S. dollar each, and a little boy distributed tickets made of toilet paper folded many times over. I turned around to look at the other moviegoers; they were all wearing 3D dark glasses, in line to see the same film. The theater is closed now, and Julia’s porchside compañeros say it’s because the authorities got wind of its popularity — and profitability. After the movie, as we walked back to Julia’s house in the pitch-black darkness, discussing the changes in Cuba, we encountered a group of young people drinking rum and playing congas. They seemed happy and bursting with life. I inquired about the cause for celebration, but of course there was none. Living life as it comes is just what Cubans do.
technology,Hacker Enters Guilty Plea - The New York Times LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7 — A 20-year-old man has pleaded guilty to federal charges of infiltrating sensitive computer systems, including those at Stanford University and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The man, Jason Allen Diekman of Mission Viejo, Calif., entered the plea under seal on Monday. Sentencing was set for Feb. 5. Mr. Diekman was charged with illegal hacking and using stolen credit card numbers to buy more than $6,000 worth of merchandise. The most serious invasions were at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and at Stanford. At the NASA laboratory, two computers were broken into at the "root level," which gives an intruder the ability to create, delete or modify files and to alter security on the system.
sports/olympics,Encore, for the Norwegian Curlers and Their Pants - The New York Times LAS VEGAS —  The sun had set on the Strip and some members of the Norwegian curling team were taking a break from competing in a tournament here. They were ready to hit the town, the Bellagio, perhaps, and maybe dinner at Caesars Palace. But the men knew that tourists would not recognize them as Scandinavian stars of an obscure sport. People cared more about their pants. In a scene straight out of a geekier version of “Ocean’s Eleven,” Thomas Ulsrud, the team’s skip, wore purple paisley pants with a matching jacket. Christoffer Svae opted for a tuxedo with a playing card pattern, and Haavard Vad Petersson wore bright pink cotton candy swirls with dots of electric green. Camera phones, laughter and the drunken exclamations of tourists followed the team as it traversed the dizzying casino carpet. “You would think in Vegas people have seen crazy stuff like that before,” Svae said. “But they got a lot of attention.” The curlers have gotten used to people paying attention to their clothes. In 2010, at the Vancouver Games, where the Norwegians won a silver medal, they made a splash when they made the sheet of curling ice their runway, competing in pants of bright red, white and blue, the colors of their country’s flag. The pants came as a shock in a sport in which athletes traditionally wear black and draw little notice outside curling circles.
sports/olympics,But for the coming Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, the Norwegian team is back, and so are its pants. This year, there are at least two new pairs: one that’s a zigzag homage to Norway’s flag and one that’s black and flowery and could be called grandmother-chic. Days after the threads were unveiled in Vancouver, an unofficial Facebook page devoted to the team’s pants collected more than 500,000 likes. (That’s about a tenth of the population of Norway.) Representatives of Loudmouth, the company in Foster City, Calif., that made the pants, said orders out of London went up tenfold, and the company’s servers crashed. “It was enough to cause a stir in the curling world,” said Tony D’Orazio, a curler in Rochester, N.Y., who started the fan page and has chronicled the team’s fashion for the last four years. “For them to do what they did in 2010, it was revolutionary to curling. It took the traditions of the sport and re-energized it for a new generation.” And for the last year, designers and the team have been working on a highly anticipated line for Sochi. The designs were intended to be tributes to Norway, but they also had to look good on television, said Scott Woodworth, the founder of Loudmouth. The company made the team’s Vancouver pants and subsequently came on board as a sponsor. The designers avoided white so the pants would not be lost on the ice. But they did not want the plain black that has been a ubiquitous part of curlers’ gear for generations.
sports/olympics,“They needed to be Norway colors,” Woodworth said. “They needed to look good and be striking.” The tradition of the colorful pants began as an accident. Svae was looking online for gear after a supplier shipped the wrong uniform to the team just weeks before pre-Olympic training. He found golf pants with a red, white and blue checkered pattern and ordered a set in his teammates’ sizes. (Previously, the pattern was mostly purchased by fans of the University of Mississippi Rebels.) “We didn’t really try to prove a point or anything,” Svae said. “It was just feeling comfortable with what we were wearing to represent our country. Obviously, it was a break from tradition.” At first, Svae’s teammates did not go for it. “I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I had seen,” Torger Nergaard said. But he did not think fans would care one way or the other. “As long as we were wearing pants, I didn’t think there would be too much of a fuss.” Four years later, the teammates say the pants improved their performance. Now they wear them in practice and in competitions. “It kind of took the edge off everything,” Svae said. “When our games were not going too well, we’d look at each other and think, Oh, you look like a clown. So it made us feel at ease.” Now, each player’s closet is a rainbow of 80 to 90 pairs of loud pants. They travel to each competition with about six options, usually coordinated by Svae. “My wife hates it,” Ulsrud said.
sports/olympics,There are rules to go with the pants. One is that they all wear the same pants together as a team, never alone. “These pants would be great to win in,” Vad Petersson said. “But they’d be terrible to lose in. We decided that when we wear them, we have to really try and win and go the whole way.”
us,Action and Dysfunction in the U.S. Food-Safety Effort - The New York Times The notion that “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste” is credited to the American economist Paul Romer, who offered the thought a decade ago in a discussion about education. Mr. Romer’s observation has since been echoed in a variety of contexts. It could be applied as well to stewardship of this country’s food supply. Significant measures to keep Americans from being sickened, and sometimes killed, by what they eat have tended to come only after calamity strikes. Even then, in the view of many experts on food safety, the United States has wasted too many crises for comfort. This pattern of horror-induced action is not new. An early consumer protection law, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, was inspired by stomach-turning descriptions of unsanitary meat processing plants in Upton Sinclair’s novel “The Jungle.” In 1938, Congress passed legislation giving the Food and Drug Administration enhanced powers after some food companies were found to have doctored rancid meat and vegetables to make them more palatable. Four years ago, after repeated outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act, which further strengthened the F.D.A. and sought to focus federal regulators more on preventing contamination, not just reacting after the fact.
us,Still, specialists in the food-safety field are hardly convinced that all is now fine because of a new law. Far from it. By the most recent estimates of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tainted food sickens 48 million Americans a year, sends nearly 128,000 of them to the hospital and leaves more than 3,000 dead. To explore enduring concerns, Retro Report, a series of video documentaries focused on major news stories of the past, zeroes in on one of the country’s worst moments in this regard. That was a 1993 flare-up of illness, largely in Western states, for which undercooked hamburgers served by the Jack in the Box fast-food chain were blamed. The culprit was a toxin-producing bacterium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, which can be menacing, especially for the young and the old. More than 700 people were sickened in the 1993 outbreak. Some suffered kidney failure. Four children died. It proved to be one crisis that was not wasted. Procedures at processing plants were tightened to keep beef from coming into contact with feces or with the contents of cow intestines, where this particular strain of E. coli naturally resides. Jack in the Box raised its cooking temperature to 155 degrees from 140, which also became a federal standard to kill any bacteria that may have found their way onto hamburger patties.
us,Significantly, in 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a division of the Agriculture Department, declared E. coli O157:H7 to be an “adulterant.” That meant the tolerance level for it would be zero. It was the first time that a food-borne organism had been so labeled, making it no different from any foreign matter — say, a chemical or cigarette ash — that might contaminate a batch of ground beef. Now, at the first sign of E. coli, the food would be automatically subject to recall. In 2011, this adulterant scarlet letter was extended to six less common strains of E. coli. Within a decade of the Jack in the Box ordeal, recalls of tainted beef dwindled. But the troubles were not over. Outbreaks affecting other foods kept coming: spinach, lettuce, cantaloupes, unpasteurized apple juice. Nor was domestically raised produce the only concern. Imports account for an estimated 15 percent of the food that Americans consume, yet federal officials have often been unable to vouch for the safety practices of overseas growers and processors. E. coli is not the lone villain. Salmonella bacteria sicken a million Americans a year and take 370 or more lives, according to C.D.C. estimates. Salmonella is, in fact, the country’s No. 1 food-borne killer. Chickens and eggs are particularly vulnerable; an outbreak in 2010 led to the recall of 500 million eggs. Unlike E. coli, salmonella is not classified as an adulterant by the Agriculture Department, though the F.D.A. sets its own rules and can order recalls of salmonella-tainted food. Whether normal cooking destroys every one of the pathogens that may linger is an open question.
us,As some food safety specialists see it, the oversight system is a study in dysfunction. “It’s slow to react to science — it’s slow to react to change,” Dr. David Acheson told Retro Report. Dr. Acheson, now an adviser to food companies, used to be the chief medical officer at the Food Safety and Inspection Service and at the F.D.A. A certain amount of political buck-passing may also be at work, as shown in an installment of “Frontline” that is scheduled to be broadcast on Tuesday on PBS. In that segment, which explores safety in the poultry business, the Agriculture Department and Congress essentially blame each other for the lack of action to label salmonella as an adulterant. Part of the problem, some believe, is the balkanized nature of safety inspections. Most responsibilities fall to the F.D.A. and to the safety inspection service. But 13 federal agencies play lesser roles as well. Forming this bureaucratic alphabet soup are the C.D.C.; the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration; the Agricultural Marketing Service; the Agricultural Research Service; the Economic Research Service; the National Agricultural Statistics Service; the National Institute of Food and Agriculture; the National Marine Fisheries Service; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau; United States Customs and Border Protection and — are you still with us? — the Federal Trade Commission.
us,The fragmentation is enough to arch eyebrows. The safety inspection service has jurisdiction over meat, poultry and processed eggs. The F.D.A. is responsible for nearly everything else — in all, roughly 80 percent of the nation’s food supply. How does this work out? Not always smoothly. A frozen cheese and tomato pizza is the province of F.D.A. inspectors. But scatter slices of pepperoni across that pie, and the safety inspection service takes over. Eggs still in their shell? They are the F.D.A.’s concern. But if the eggs are cracked and whipped into some other product, the inspection service has the ball. Then there is the Agricultural Marketing Service setting quality standards for eggs — Grade AA, Grade A and so forth — but not checking at the same time for bacteria. That safety control is the F.D.A.’s job. In February, the Obama administration sought to impose a measure of order by proposing that all these agencies be combined into a single entity: the Food Safety Administration, which would become part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Whether anything will actually change is uncertain. Congress must give its consent. Turf struggles among the agencies are unlikely to vanish overnight. And some consumer groups and food safety experts are not convinced that creating a giant bureaucracy is the magic wand that will make the system’s shortcomings suddenly disappear. There is a sobering lesson in the Food Safety Modernization Act, the law that bolstered the F.D.A. Four years later, that agency still struggles to get the money it needs to do the job right.
us,Over the past four years, Congress gave the F.D.A. less than half of the $580 million that it should have had, the Congressional Budget Office said last month. Which brings us back to Mr. Romer and crises. Dr. Acheson, for one, says that nothing short of a catastrophe may be necessary to rattle officialdom sufficiently to redesign the safety system. Rather grimly, he told Retro Report, “We need — I hate to say it, but — bodies in the street before we get it.”
garden,Clingstone: The Old House and the Sea - The New York Times Jamestown, R.I. “THIS house is always going to have rough edges,” said Henry Wood, resting his frayed sneakers on a splintered pillar. “It’s never going to look like the Breakers.” It was another indecently beautiful day at Clingstone — a faded, shingled and, yes, very rough 103-year-old mansion set on a rock  in Narragansett Bay — and Mr. Wood, its owner, was musing on what the place is not: specifically, that grander turn-of-the century folly in nearby Newport, a limestone-and-gilt palace built by a Vanderbilt in 1895. But in fact it’s the rough edges and salt-encrusted surfaces that Mr. Wood, a 79-year-old Boston architect, treasures most about Clingstone. For nearly half a century, he has kept them (more or less) intact, and the house standing, through his own hard labor and that of others. He and a crew of family and friends who share his passion for the place’s “deep bohemian funk,” as Nicholas Benson, a stone carver from Newport, put it, have dedicated their time and skills (plumbing and wiring experience are always particularly welcome) to keeping the place from slipping into the water forever. In 1961, when Mr. Wood bought the house with his ex-wife Joan, who is also an architect, for $3,600, it had been empty for two decades. All of its 65 windows were smashed, and its slate roof was wide open to the sky. Vandals had been creative: on the second floor, the interior shingles were embedded with marbles (they still are), which had been blasted there by some sort of firearm.
garden,On three sides, four-by-eight-foot plywood signs proclaimed: “For Sale. See Any Broker.” “So we did see any broker,” Mr. Wood said. “And he told us the owners were asking $5,000 but they’d take much, much less.” The house, he learned, had been built by a distant cousin, J. S. Lovering Wharton, from Philadelphia, who had a summer house in the Fort Wetherill area in south Jamestown. (Newport tended to attract New York society; Philadelphians summered in quieter Jamestown.) When the fort was enlarged at the end of the 1800s, the government seized his land, and Clingstone was his rebuke, Mr. Wood said. “He said, ‘I’m going to build where no one can bother me.’ ” Working with an artist, William Trost Richards, Mr. Wharton designed a shingle-style house of picture windows, with 23 rooms on three stories radiating off a vast central hall; its plan is less a blueprint than a diagram of arrows indicating sightlines. He built it like a mill, Mr. Wood said, with wide planking, sturdy oak beams, diagonal sheathing and an odd flourish: an interior cladding of shingles, put there, Mr. Wood conjectured, because Fort Wetherill’s cannons went off so regularly in training exercises that they cracked the plaster in the neighbors’ houses. Those neighbors, it seems, were skeptical of Mr. Wharton’s project. A society item in The Philadelphia Press in August 1904 reads, “Everyone is of the opinion here that Mr. Wharton will not stay in the house more than one season, and they say one nor’easter will settle it.” But Mr. Wharton loved his new house, and spent every summer there until his death just before the hurricane of 1938, which the house survived with little damage.
garden,After his widow died, in 1941, the house stood empty until Mr. Wood and his wife came upon it. The story, Mr. Wood said, is that Mr. Wharton’s three sons disliked  one another so much, they couldn’t agree on who to sell it to. “I think they only sold it to me because I was a relative,” he added. Every spring for a decade or so after the sale, Mr. Wood said, he cursed “this albatross,” his roofless, windowless, floorless, powerless, waterless house. Wrangling what had been a rich man’s plaything, attended by servants and even its own shipyard, into a working couple’s weekend getaway turned out to be much more than a working couple could handle. Eventually, though, as the Woods mustered the talents of their friends, Clingstone and its maintenance evolved into a communal lifestyle, and ultimately a kind of religion. Mr. Wood is now as proud as any parent of his house, and keeps a fat scrapbook of photographs and newspaper clippings that document its best moments. He has been known to buttonhole strangers on planes who express a knowledge of Rhode Island and say, ‘I think you know my house,’ and then fall silent, waiting for them to exclaim: The house on the rock! Once, he persuaded an airline pilot on a commuter flight from New York City to Boston to alter course to the east so the plane would fly directly over Clingstone.
garden,To get to this point, Mr. Wood became an expert scavenger, a deft barterer and an experienced arm-twister. “The number of things I’ve gotten for free,” he said happily, ticking off the 60 black porcelain doorknobs salvaged from houses that were being torn down in Boston’s South End; the overhead factory lights that came from a slaughterhouse in lower Roxbury; the lumber plucked from an old Boston-area supermarket and strung with netting to make the railing that runs around the stairwell on the second floor. (There are still no banisters on the wide, twisting main staircase, though the father of a man who was married here carved the banister posts for the back stairs.) In those first years, friends came to work and camped for weeks. The biggest worry, Mr. Wood said, was that there wasn’t any way to lock up: “We lost a lot of tools, and one brass bed.” One year Mr. Wood put an ad in The Harvard Crimson: “Island occupant wanted to live in 23-room house. No charges. No duties. Ready now.” Somehow, The Crimson printed that last line as “Leaky now.” Still, Mr. Wood was able to “hire” his first caretakers, a doctoral student and his wife, who would stay at Clingstone during the week and head back to Boston when Mr. and Mrs. Wood arrived on the weekends with their three young sons: Paul, now 45 and an employment discrimination lawyer in Boston; Josh, 41, an architect there; and Dan 38, an artist and printer living in Providence, R.I.
garden,Power in those days came from a balky portable generator for the tools, and lighting from boxes and boxes of candle “seconds” bought by Mr. Wood. Drinking water was brought over from Jamestown, as it still is. Toilets flushed directly into the sea. Today, solar panels heat the water, and a wind turbine on the roof generates electricity. Rainwater is collected in a 3,000-gallon cistern, then filtered, treated and pumped through the house for cleaning purposes. (Mr. Wood claims it is safe enough to drink, “but my children don’t trust me so we don’t,” he said.) After years of using an activated seawater system that draws in seawater, then treats and filters the waste before releasing it back into the ocean, Clingstone now has the latest generation of composting toilets. Bartering access to the house has yielded all sorts of boons, like the yearly services of the Jamestown Boatyard (formerly the Wharton Shipyard, built just for Clingstone), which hauls the family’s boats and floating dock and stores them each winter in return for a week’s use of the house in the summer. Would-be renters, Mr. Wood said, “must be able to swim, understand hurricanes, strong tides and outboards.” Upkeep is still Sisyphean, and Mr. Wood, who is divorced from both his first and second wives, has benefited from an ingenious solution: the Clingstone work weekend. Held every year around Memorial Day, it brings 70 or so friends and Clingstone lovers together to tackle jobs like washing all 65 windows and scraping and painting their frames and sills.
garden,Feeding the volunteers, who camp all over the house, is a job in itself. There are, in fact, 215 such projects in the database maintained by Anne Tait, an artist and professor who married Dan Wood in 1998,  organized by theme and skill. “Replace sewage line in basement, or offer moral support,” reads one of the project listings in this year’s schedule, under Plumbing. Under Cleaning, you’ll find, “check and maintain ‘No Bush’ sign.” (Since the 2004 election, this painted bedsheet has been hanging from a window.) And in the children’s section: “Watch babies and sing great songs to them.” Matches have been made on these weekends: those who arrived as strangers might leave holding hands, Mr. Wood said, then return the next year married. (Clingstone is jinxed, however, as a wedding spot. “We have had unfortunate results,” said Mr. Wood, referring to three Clingstone weddings that ended in divorce.) Ms. Tait shone on her first work weekend, which she attended after dating  Dan for three weeks in 1994. She used her sign-painting skills to paint the glass of all of the outside doors with the words Please hook open or close.  (Untethered doors at Clingstone are quickly smashed by the wind.) Another year, she refinished the kitchen floor. And as the house’s first female resident in a long time, she set about making it “less of a little boys’ playground and more of a home,” she said.
garden,“Henry’s sister told me, ‘Clingstone eats women,’ ” she said. “I do feel like I lost a limb or two. It’s a rough place, like camping, or a farm where you have to make your own butter.” Amused, Mr. Wood said mildly, “You never made butter here.” Joan, his first wife, had adored the house, he said (they were divorced in the late ’70s), but “my second wife hated Clingstone.” “She’d drive from Boston to a party in Jamestown, and rather than spend the night here she’d drive all the way back,” he said. “When she left, it became a man’s house, no place for a woman.” Clingstone was legendary for its parties in those years, and for what Mr. Benson, the stone carver and a peer of Mr. Wood’s sons, described as “Henry’s relaxed attitude about cleanliness.” “It was mayhem,” he added. It is no longer mayhem here, but the house still has an appealingly offhand and bohemian vibe. “It’s an organic house,” said John Benson, Nicholas’s father, whose nickname is Fud. Like his son, he is a stone carver, and a cousin of Mr. Wood’s. “It’s a house that has existed in a family that has always prized what we call the real world, which is the world of water and wind and stone and wood.”
garden,Mr. Benson, who carved an arrow pointing true north on the rocks on the bay side, is one of the house’s staunchest volunteers and most dedicated artisans. “It’s no longer a rich man’s house,” he continued. “But it has carried its elegance — no, that’s a bad word — it has carried its honesty through the generations, from the well-to-do people that built it to the people who have to work to support it.” He described Clingstone as an instance of “marvelous archeological survival,” a place that has “taken a second breath and has been kept alive by dedicated work.” A cautionary sign by the steep ladder that leads to the roof (salvaged from a telephone switching station) reads: No entry after three drinks or 86 years of age. “It used to say 80 but we had a guy on a work weekend who was 84, so I changed it,” said Mr. Wood, ever the realist. It would have been a shame to curtail the activities of a willing volunteer.
sports/football,Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-7) at St. Louis Rams (5-8) - The New York Times 8:25 p.m., NFL Network Line: Rams by 2 ½ The Buccaneers became a respectable team far faster than most predicted, but coming off a loss, they will need to win out to have a realistic chance of making the playoffs. That journey begins with a trip to St. Louis to face a team that runs the ball well and always seems to make opposing teams work hard on offense. For Tampa Bay to win this game, it will need Jameis Winston to continue his rapid development as a quarterback while also giving the ball to Doug Martin more often. Martin is second in the N.F.L. with 1,214 rushing yards, but he carried the ball only 11 times on Sunday. The Buccaneers are 0-5 when he has fewer than 15 carries but are 6-2 when he has 15-plus. St. Louis is tied for 21st in the N.F.L. in rushing defense, with an average of 115.9 yards allowed a game, but it has given up just seven rushing touchdowns, so when the Buccaneers are in the red zone, they may need Winston to finish off the drive with his arm. This may be the final game in St. Louis for the Rams, who are flirting with the possibility of a move back to Los Angeles. While the Rams were once called the Greatest Show on Turf, they would be leaving as a team with a few solid defensive players, a potential superstar rookie running back in Todd Gurley, and little else.

world/europe,Success of Five Star Movement Shows Italy’s Anger - The New York Times ROME — For months, he has been shouting his way from piazza to piazza, drawing tens of thousands as he rails against tax collectors, corrupt politicians and financial speculation. And when he arrives in Rome on Friday for the final campaign rally of his “Tsunami tour,” Beppe Grillo, the Internet-savvy comedian turned populist rabble-rouser, may lead Italy’s third-most popular party. In the final weeks of a campaign marked by widespread voter disillusionment and growing economic distress, and after Pope Benedict XVI’s decision to step down on Feb. 28 upended once-solid assumptions, Mr. Grillo’s Five Star Movement has surged ahead, surprising the experts almost as much as Pope Benedict did. Ahead of national elections on Feb. 24 and 25, the party’s “antisystem” message has drawn strong support from both right and left, buoyed by corruption scandals that have undermined voters’ faith in government. With his fiery language, mop of gray curls, grass-roots campaigning and calls for a referendum on Italy’s staying in the euro zone, Mr. Grillo, 64, has helped blunt the gains made by Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister. Mr. Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party is now in second place in opinion polls but lacks potential coalition partners, making it all but impossible that Mr. Berlusconi, the ultimate campaigner, will ever govern Italy again, political experts say.
world/europe,The center-left Democratic Party, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, a subdued former industry minister, is expected to place first, but it may not win enough seats to govern without help from an ally, probably the civic movement started by Mario Monti, the caretaker prime minister who stepped down before the elections after leading a technocratic government for the past year. Mr. Monti is respected by world leaders but has fumbled into fourth place as a candidate, seriously tarnishing both his image and the agenda of change he promoted. With no official polls allowed in the two weeks before elections — and with turnout expected to be at a record low — the outcome of the race remains uncertain. If the results fail to yield a government, the political uncertainty could set off a new round of market turmoil. But more worrisome in the longer term, political commentators say, is that the success of Mr. Grillo’s Five Star Movement, an opposition party, could make Parliament ungovernable. “In my view, we will have a majority,” said Stefano Folli, a political columnist for the business daily Il Sole 24 Ore, speaking of a possible alliance of the Bersani and Monti forces. “But the second question is: Will the majority be enough to govern a Parliament where 20 percent of the M.P.’s come from Grillo’s party? That does not have a simple answer.”
world/europe,What worries critics most about Mr. Grillo’s Five Star Movement is that it is an assemblage of first-time candidates with no shared vision except an opposition to politics as usual. That, combined with its consensus-driven approach, makes it hard to predict how its members will vote. In speeches, Mr. Grillo has criticized Italy’s participation in the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, questioned the need for mandatory vaccines for children and opposed some local plans to privatize Italy’s water supply. But on other issues, the party leans right. It is opposed to changing Italy’s laws to grant citizenship to the children of legal immigrants born in Italy, a move the Democratic Party supports. “Theirs is a project of destruction, not of creation,” said Federico Fornaro, a candidate for the Democratic Party in the northern Piedmont region. “Their goal is chaos, the destruction of the old system. But there’s no concrete plan for a new system, not in the political, economic or social realms.” The success of the Five Star Movement is not hard to explain. Taking cues from the themes of the Occupy Wall Street movement, it has tapped into voter disgust with the political establishment: the excesses and corruption scandals involving Mr. Berlusconi’s party, the tax increases of Mr. Monti’s government, and the ossification of the Democratic Party, which has also been hit by a widening scandal at the Monte dei Paschi of Siena bank.
world/europe,The Five Star Movement has been gaining momentum since regional elections last spring, when it won the mayor’s race in Parma in the north and became the leading party in Sicily, after record low turnout. As he took to the stage in Piazza del Duomo in Milan this week, Mr. Grillo was greeted by a huge crowd shouting: “Send them home! Send them home!” referring to the current Parliament. He began a tirade, saying that no one would have expected his party to win in Sicily, “where they pay for votes.” He added that Italy’s tax collection agency should be closed, and he criticized the country’s high youth unemployment rates. Mr. Grillo, who under his party’s bylaws cannot serve in Parliament because he has a conviction for manslaughter in a car accident in which three people died, has shied away from taking journalists’ questions. In a rare television interview on Thursday, Mr. Grillo said that bond spreads — the difference in yields between Italian and benchmark German bonds — were a “hallucination,” and that financial markets had become dangerously disconnected from the real economy. As he sat outside his shop in Rome, Stefano Anidori, 52, said he had voted for the left in the past, but was considering supporting Mr. Grillo. “I am undecided, but I am so angry that I think I’ll vote for Grillo,” he said. But he also worried that the movement was too new in politics.
world/europe,“How can they propose laws or understand the system quickly enough for a country in such deep trouble?” he asked. “But I voted for the left for 20 years. I am tired of losing and tired of seeing the same faces over and over again.” With such divergent supporters and candidates, it remains to be seen how the Five Star Movement will vote in Parliament. Roberto D’Alimonte, a political scientist and a pollster at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, called Mr. Grillo a “uniquely Italian invention.” “We invented fascism, the Christian Democrats, Berlusconi, and now we’ve even invented Grillo.”
movies,In ‘It Felt Like Love,’ a Teenager Flirts With Danger - The New York Times A mood poem to summer loving and sexual awakening, “It Felt Like Love” powerfully evokes a time when flesh is paramount, and peer behavior is the standard by which we judge our own. That’s certainly true for Lila (Gina Piersanti), a coltish 14-year-old unaware of her beauty but intensely conscious of her body. Hanging out at the beach or at parties in her working-class Brooklyn neighborhood, she silently notes the casual intimacies of her slightly older friend (Giovanna Salimeni) and her boyfriend, as they un-self-consciously fondle and flirt. Uncertainly mimicking their sexual assurance, and with no mother to guide her, Lila randomly fixes on Sammy (Ronen Rubinstein), a weed-smoking, pornography-watching bad boy whose contempt for women is as potent as his pheromones. Held together with few words and only the loosest of narratives, this insightful first feature from Eliza Hittman unspools mostly in sensual (but never salacious) close-ups and dreamy tracking shots. Using a soft light that makes skin tones sing, Sean Porter photographs the mainly young cast with an easy intimacy that highlights his director’s highly intuitive points. Collaborating seamlessly, the filmmakers remind us of the dangers of teenage desire and — especially when seasoned with the rap music Sammy enjoys — the vast gulf between male and female notions of romantic connection.
movies,Stalking Lila’s smooth, swimsuit-clad back or clinging to her sunblock-smeared face — a metaphor reiterated in the mask she wears during a dance recital — “It Felt Like Love” seductively conjures a moment when trying on identities can be a fast track to self-knowledge. Or self-destruction.
books/review,Where Is the Ham of Yesteryear? - The New York Times THE GOOD REMAINS By Nani Power. 323 pp. New York: Grove Press. $24. In the small Virginia town of Ashland, ham is a big deal. The characters in ''The Good Remains'' go on and on about it: how to cook it, how not to cook it, how to serve it, how to stick cloves into it and, most of all, how it used to taste better 40 years ago. The book's central character, Dr. C. R. Ash, a randy neonatologist, barks at his secretary: ''I want to get back to my roots, hear. My roots are not nachos, woman. I am not from pesto or, or bagels. I am from ham, is what I'm saying. My people ate some good ham.'' I hate to call ham a symbol, but there it is. In ''The Good Remains,'' ham is a symbol of the lost deliciousness of youth, not to mention the dying local knowledge of the South. Nani Power has written an elegy for the place she loves, albeit an elegy that takes as its cri de coeur the Lynyrd Skynyrd song ''Free Bird.''
books/review,The ham lover in question, Dr. Ash, is the last in the line of an old Southern family. Unmarried and childless, he's the belle of Ball's Bluff Babies Hospital, saving lives, flirting nonstop, dispensing chocolates and having relationship-ettes with nurses. He lives alone, and as he rattles around the family pile eating Stouffer's lasagna, he dreams of ham. It's not a bad life. Ash's relatively easy times are, however, coming to an end. Kirsten, a teenage candy striper at Ball's Bluff, has given birth to a premature baby, who becomes known around the hospital as Tuffy. Under Ash's care, Tuffy is given one too many cc's of milk, goes septic and dies. Meanwhile, Ash and Kirsten develop mutual crushes and finally indulge in a make-out session in the good doctor's office. Tuffy's short life ends just before Christmas, and ''The Good Remains'' follows the town of Ashland as it gets ready for the holiday. The point of view jumps around like the camera in a student film: The portly and courtly Dr. Pendleton Compton is faced with the problem of whether or not to rat on Ash, his best friend, regarding the candy striper incident. Meanwhile, he pines for Betty Owens, Ash's prim secretary. Along the way, we meet Diane and Verona, two housewives whose catering company has gotten the contract for the big hospital Christmas party. Then there's Todd, Diane's son, the unwitting father of Tuffy. Todd's across-the-street neighbor, Hermie, has lost his own dad to suicide and is trying on the role of ''pitiful youth on the cusp obsessed with death.''
books/review,The plot swings wide open, letting in more and more characters, until it finally hits the doorstop of the hospital Christmas party, whereupon the novel ends. The whole thing is shabbily put together, with little feeling of forward movement and a hyperactive, grasping, trumped-up ending. But we read with interest, even eagerness, because Power is so adept at creating a cast of voices. They're not managed very well, stumbling on stage at odd moments -- Hermie, for instance, a main character, doesn't appear until more than halfway through the book. But who cares? Every one of Power's dozen or so characters brims with life and goofiness and -- not unrelated to goofiness -- human frailty. What's more, they're all great talkers. It's the rare novel that can switch voices this often and not lose our interest. (We got a taste of this kind of shape-shifting in Power's first novel, ''Crawling at Night.'')
books/review,Nowhere is Power's versatility more obvious than in a four-page passage in the middle of the book. Several of Ash's acquaintances are testifying as to his character. A woman named June Roberts takes over the narration, telling how she and another woman both had babies who were tended by Dr. Ash in the intensive care unit. Here I must slip briefly into the autobiographical: those of us who have had babies in the neonatal I.C.U. belong to a horrible, exclusive club. We feel no one else can remotely understand our experience; in fact we begrudge their understanding. And yet Power's description is spot on. She gets just right the obsessive acquisition of anatomical knowledge, the ''delirious'' love coupled with ''suffocating fear'' for the baby, and above all, the constant looking for signs: ''She tries to decipher each syllable, each utterance of the wise doctor (did that oh, me mean that the baby is sure to die? Is that it? I don't want to ask, because then it's sealed and signed and a done deed. . . . This woman believes life is a changeable structure of possibilities, as changing and constant as the oximeter.'') Parents of a sick baby live and die by the oximeter, a machine that measures oxygen levels in blood. Power's writing gives off the unmistakable whiff of the truth.
books/review,Of course one is only human and immediately wonders: did Nani Power have a sick baby? But it's just as likely that she's been a druggie Goth teenage son of a suicide, or a frumpy, cat-loving secretary, or a proud, genteel Civil War re-enactment docent or, for that matter, a lustful, aging neonatologist. Because all these characters feel just as real and are just as sensitively portrayed. Power's writing can be a little cute. Her gimmickry -- for instance, C. R. Ash spells out ''crash,'' and what's more, he winds up in one -- isn't smart enough to justify itself. Drawings and maps and handwritten signatures look as though they were fun to make but remain as mute and unhelpful as doodles. Dickens's ''Christmas Carol'' is referred to throughout the book, sometimes to good comic effect (Goth teen dresses up as Tiny Tim) and sometimes not (sections are pretentiously labeled ''staves''). Power's ironies, too, seem overstated, as when an account of Kirsten's sexual adventures is juxtaposed with a hospital memo delineating her duties as a candy striper (as if it's a big shocker that wholesome teenagers are having sex). The best writing in the book is less affected, calling to mind a slightly skewed version of more straightforward Southern writers like Ellen Gilchrist and Nancy Lemann. All write stunningly good dialogue, and all are professional mourners of the good old days.
books/review,Memory in ''The Good Remains'' is a business and an obsession. But for all that's scrupulously remembered, just as much is forgotten. In one of the more strangely moving passages of the book, Dr. Ash tries to cook a ham the way his father did. The results are hideous. If ham is anything to go by -- and Power seems to think it is -- the South won't rise again.
garden,The Painter and the Pink Palazzo - The New York Times YOU can see it all the way from Bleecker, now that the leaves are thinning on West 11th Street. Awkward, particular and very pink, Julian Schnabel’s much-publicized and still only partly sold condo-palazzo near the West Side Highway beckons invitingly on a late Sunday afternoon. Named Palazzo Chupi after Mr. Schnabel’s pet name for his wife, the actress Olatz López Garmendia (the endearment is an abbreviation of Chupa Chups, the trendy Spanish lollipops), the stepped, neo-Mediterranean development planted on the top of an old stable will never win any architectural prizes. Mr. Schnabel said he sketched its form in 15 minutes, but its odd pitch and height probably owe more to a zoning formula that dictates the ratio of square footage to lot size. Yet it is sui generis — handmade and human-looking — in a neighborhood marked by a rash of development in glass and steel that has threatened to turn the area along West Street into a mirror image of Jersey City. And the tale of its construction is, if not a heroic one, still an odyssey of sorts for which the building accrued almost as much attention as the Richard Meier beauty queens behind it. Palazzo Chupi is a brand extension for the omnivorous Mr. Schnabel, now 57, and as such an object lesson in the power — or failure — of a famous painter to sell three-bedroom condos for seven figures. The price tags bring flourishes like 18-foot ceilings, baronial bathrooms with rough-hewn fireplaces, and handmade hinges and door handles designed by the artist.
garden,Adopted early on by the impish real estate blog Curbed, whose editors gleefully chronicled its growing pains (Chupi in Crisis! Chupi Price Chop! Chupi Paint Peeling!), the building was conceptualized by Mr. Schnabel just as the far West Village — everything west of Washington Street — was being rezoned in 2005. Its construction was vigorously protested by his neighbors, who marched with placards like “No More Monuments to Greed” and who later charged that work was done illegally to beat the deadline limiting the height of new buildings in the neighborhood to 75 feet. At 170 feet, Chupi towers over many of its neighbors. Completed at the start of the city’s economic meltdown, the place remains half empty. Originally “marketed” by word of mouth as a club for Mr. Schnabel’s rock star pals — it was rumored that Bono and Madonna would buy, or at the very least Hugh Jackman and those perennial shoppers, the Olsen twins — by last spring Mr. Schnabel decided he needed some old-fashioned salespeople and listed two of the five “houses” with Brown Harris Stevens. When they didn’t sell by summer, he switched to Corcoran, where James Lansill, a heavyweight involved with the Meier buildings and other big-ticket developments, presides over marketing for the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. Prices on the two, a duplex and a triplex, each nearly 4,000 square feet, have been reduced to $24 million from $32 million, and to $23 million from $27 million. Those prices may be negotiable. Still, at over $6,000 per square foot, if reached they would set a record for the area, beating out the sale of a Meier penthouse three years ago for $4,565 per square foot.
garden,Two of the five units were sold early on, to William Brady, a managing director of Credit Suisse for $15.5 million, and to the actor Richard Gere for $12 million — though that apartment is back on the market and listed with Sotheby’s for $15 million. One unit was reserved for Mr. Schnabel’s wife and their twin teenage sons. Anyone who moves in will be hovering above Mr. Schnabel’s warehouse, itself a three-story building that holds his own floor-through, his studio and a pool. There is also a garage and an exhibition space. On a recent Sunday, Mr. Schnabel, who was looking very much like a young Henry VIII (as dressed by Eddie Vedder, not Holbein, in a blue flannel shirt, white pajama bottoms and bright red socks) padded from one palazzo to another, with this reporter in tow. It took an hour and a half to wander from the swimming pool on the ground floor to the baronial living room of the vacant triplex, 170 feet above 11th Street.
garden,At Mr. Lansill’s suggestion, Mr. Schnabel had decorated the empty palazzos with his own things, and there was a lot to see — in his own hall, Mr. Schnabel’s massive sculpture of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon (he’s in a bath, she’s about to sink the ax in his head), like Philip Guston channeling Homer, along with 17th-century Belgian tapestries on dark clapboard walls (“cozy,” explained Mr. Schnabel); a bronze lamp Mr. Schnabel had made to look like a shark’s saw tooth in his wife’s quarters; a Cy Twombly on one wall; blood red Venetian damask on another; Venetian glass chandeliers; 19th-century Portuguese antiques; Mr. Schnabel’s own paintings, including one Picasso copy above a fireplace (“I painted it one day just to see if I could,” Mr. Schnabel said); Venetian beds dressed in Ms. Garmendia’s linens from her store, Olatz, and the dark-stained reclaimed bead board that wrapped stairs and the kitchens and gave each palazzo that “Venice meets Leland, Mich.,” vibe, as Mr. Schnabel put it. There were also trash compactors, washing machines and steam baths. “Here’s a nice bathroom,” Mr. Schnabel said of one. “I know you’re not supposed to use adjectives for bathrooms, but it is nice.” (It would appear three palazzos were toured, though this reporter lost her bearings in palazzo No. 2 and can’t be sure.) Along the way, dogs appeared and vanished, along with Mr. Schnabel’s 22-year-old son, Vito, and a designer and raw food guru named Xavier Llongueras, who fetched new slippers for Mr. Schnabel when it was discovered he was tracking yellow paint everywhere.
garden,Mr. Schnabel settled at last into a pink velvet wing-back chair in the triplex. “It’s nice here, it’s quiet, and you’re not a prisoner to your view,” he said, a dig at the Meier towers behind him. “You can have an interior life up here.” Why did he build the Chupi? “I built it because I wanted more space, and because I thought I could sell two or three apartments to pay for that space, and I built it because I could,” said Mr. Schnabel, who said he spent “a lot” on its construction. “I’m sorry if I inconvenienced anybody, but I tried to be a good neighbor.” He sang a line from Lennon’s “Working Class Hero”: “As soon as you’re born they make you feel small. ...” Artists are always misunderstood, Mr. Schnabel pointed out. He said he’d always liked the work of Addison Mizner, the architect who created the resort of Boca Raton, Fla., in the 1920s (and who died, bankrupt, in 1933), and he wanted to merge that style with some elements of his own Stanford White house in Montauk, like the dark bead board paneling and green kitchen tiles. He wanted to deploy “memory chips” so that it looked old and noble, like Lord Marchmain in exile. He wanted fireplaces that recalled Stonehenge. He also wanted to make some really big rooms. “You’re a kid in Brooklyn and you look around and the scale of everything is wrong and that’s your life and you sort of have to accept that,” Mr. Schnabel said, clearly happy to be miles away from his childhood home in Flatbush.
garden,He took another tack, that of civic booster. “Instead of going that way,” he cocked his head in a southwesterly direction, toward the Meier towers again, “instead of building some anonymous glass towers,” Mr. Schnabel broke off, then moved this reporter from one spot to another, so she could see one of his paintings, which had the word Zeus written in white on a bright splash of red. He began again: “It’s like, O.K., we’re going to pull the reins back this way, so somehow there’s a little bit of stability or safety. You know, a little bit of humanism. I always thought it was terrible when people would throw things away because they weren’t shiny or new or made out of Formica. My mother, God bless her, and my father, they had no idea what an object was, they had no history. They worked all their lives, they didn’t have time to reflect, which is what a middle-class person who becomes an artist can do. They have time to think about whatever, about making things.” When this reporter left the building, she bumped into two architectural tourists who were walking backward up 11th Street, armed with tiny cameras and trying to grok the whole building in the falling light. Cinematic and lovely inside, the condo-palazzos float like Citizen Kane’s Xanadu high above the remains of the West Village, still a cautionary tale in the merging of art and commerce, though Maria Pashby, the blue-chip Corcoran broker who has the listings of the duplex and the triplex, said two interested buyers were circling.
garden,“Julian is an aesthetic omnivore,” said Dodie Kazanjian, who covers the art world for Vogue and is the director of Gallery Met at the Metropolitan Opera; she toured Chupi a few weeks ago. “Everything he touches becomes a Schnabel. So I looked at it” — Chupi, that is — “like another piece of art.” But in the neighborhood, there are lingering resentments. “It’s woefully out of context and a monument to this guy’s ego,” said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, one of the neighborhood groups that fought to block Chupi’s construction. He has called the building “an exploded Malibu Barbie house.” “The biggest thing we took away from all this,” he continued, “is that the system is somewhat broken. Developers have the opportunity to break the law and beat the clock on rezoning and the public has little recourse.” (In response, Brian Kelly, a musician and old friend of Mr. Schnabel’s who managed the project for the artist, said, “We played by the rules and didn’t seek any favors.”) “Personally, I adore it,” said Paul Rudnick, the novelist and playwright, who lives across the street and watched the “landing” of Chupi with great interest. “It’s in the grand tradition of Manhattan white elephants, which make you wonder, Who lives there, and why? It’s already a landmark. And it’s much more in the tradition of the West Village, which is supposed to be outrageous and theatrical, than all those glass towers. When the transsexuals left it seems they were reincarnated as real estate,” said Mr. Rudnick mistily, referring to the professionals who used to line the streets here. “At least the Palazzo does them proud.”
garden,Home-Schooling Grows in New York City - The New York Times ONE morning early last month, long after that frantic hour between 7 and 8 when most New York City parents were hustling their 4-, 5- and 6-year-olds out the door and into their first day of kindergarten, Benny Rendell, the 5-year-old son of Joanne Rendell, a novelist, and Brad Lewis, a New York University professor, lay sprawled asleep in his bed, enjoying what his mother described as his first day of unkindergarten. Benny stayed asleep, as is his habit, until well past 11 a.m., while his mother, whose first book,  “The Professors’ Wives’ Club,” was just published by NAL Accent, worked on her new novel. When Benny awoke, he and his mother slowly made their way to a friend’s house in Brooklyn, with Benny reading the subway stops out loud on the way, and counting out change at a vegetable stand. They spent the afternoon in a Fort Greene backyard; while Benny played with his pals in the mud, the grown-ups looked on, and shared a cold one. Ms. Rendell, 34, and Mr. Lewis, 51, are no slouches in the academic department — with two Ph.D.’s and an M.D. between them, the two fell in love at an academic conference and Mr. Lewis is now a faculty in residence in one of N.Y.U.’s only residential colleges. Nonetheless, they have made the semi-radical (for New York, anyway) and anti-academic choice to keep Benny out of the school system, for now. They are part of a community of like-minded parents who are opting to enrich rather than formally educate their not-yet-school-age children (6 is the age that New York City law requires parents to register their children as home-schooled). They discovered one another through the New York City Home Educators Alliance (nychea.org), a home-schooling bulletin board.
garden,Benny’s parents aren’t home-schooling in the traditional sense, by hewing to a curriculum, nor are they strictly “unschooling,” that is, following the teachings of John Holt, a progressive educator who promoted a child-led learning movement that is a wildly democratic subset of the home-schooling world. Rather, theirs is an ad hoc, day-by-day exploration into what it means to be a stay-at-home parent and child in an accelerated culture like New York. In a city where the race to be on top can start in infancy, the disconnect between these parents’ choices and the New York City norm is vast, as Ms. Rendell learned recently. A few weeks ago, Ms. Rendell wrote an essay about Benny’s first day of “unkindergarten” — complete with an evocative description of that hot afternoon and the beer the parents enjoyed — for the hip online parents’ magazine, Babble (babble.com). Its editor in chief, Ada Calhoun, published the piece under the magazine’s personal essay rubric, the coyly named Bad Parent. (Past columns have included essays about fighting in front of one’s children and, last week, a mother’s embrace of fast food.) Despite the column’s reputation and mandate as a forum for parents to discuss choices made outside the mainstream, Ms. Calhoun said, Ms. Rendell’s essay drew howls of protest from readers, and broke the record, at nearly 200, for the number of its comments.
garden,Ms. Rendell, being a writer, had drawn her readers in with a sassy lead.  “My son Benny was out late last night at a bar in Soho,” her essay began. But her readers, once hooked, revolted: “Selfish,” “self-indulgent,” “call C.P.S.,” “bar hopping family” were typical responses in those 198 comments, never mind that the piece also discussed Benny’s above-grade-level reading and museum trips. In Ms. Calhoun’s opinion, “what got people going,” was a sense that these readers “were being out-hipped or out-cooled,” as she put it, that they were “feeling jealous on some level that Joanne had the opportunity to stay home with her son.” “And then the other side were comments just being totally critical of what they saw as not taking proper care of him,” Ms. Calhoun continued. “They were morally offended by this child sleeping late.” Ms. Rendell was stunned by the reaction, and put some of it down to a culture clash: she is British. And she acknowledged that being a parent always involves some sort of compromise or sacrifice, and one’s choices, if different from another’s, can seem like an affront. “I think people judge parents on very superficial things,” said Elsa Haas, a passionate unschooler in Staten Island, whose son, Tyler, is 9, and who knew about the Babble kerfuffle. “I think Joanne was using a literary device, and she made a choice to emphasize certain things, like going to a bar and having a drink. People in their comments distorted that to getting drunk and bar hopping. Why? It’s a distortion that shows their own anxieties.”
garden,Indeed, the common thread running through most of the Babble commentary was the idea that Ms. Rendell was having too much fun. “I’m so not the party girl,” Ms. Rendell said. Instead, she described herself as a woman who has crafted a life that fits what she sees as her child’s developmental stage as well as that of his parents. On a recent Tuesday evening, Benny was playing a game with one of the college students from down the hall — Mr. Lewis and Ms. Rendell are living in the middle of a dorm, in an apartment whose rooms, while very large, are separated only by partitions. Rent-free housing gave Ms. Rendell the opportunity to stay home with Benny, she said. “It’s part of the equation.” And next year and beyond, until, perhaps, he asks to go to school, they will be home together, too. The seed was sown years ago. Mr. Lewis had friends back home in Tennessee whose home-schooled children greatly impressed him when they visited some years back. “They were incredible,” he said. “They blew us away. They were interested in us as people, and I got to thinking, no wonder, they grew up in this community that included a lot of adults.” Ms. Rendell, who excelled at her private school in Plymouth, England, said that before she visited her husband’s friends in Tennessee, she knew nothing about home-schoolers and assumed they were all “lonely weirdoes.”
garden,When Benny was 2, the couple attended a conference on alternative education, and were captivated, they said, by one woman’s lecture about choosing not to be led by the school bell. The clincher may have been the community they connected with in New York through online bulletin boards. Ms. Rendell soon found herself in a group of roughly 12 families with similarly aged children, with whom she spends at least two days a week, on field trips and in reading groups and other activities. With Benny, Mr. Lewis went on to say, “we embraced a hybrid between home-schooling and unschooling. It’s not structured, it’s Benny-centric, we follow his interests and desires, and yet we are helping him to learn to read and do math.” They read to him hours every day. “It’s about trying to find things we both enjoy doing,” Ms. Rendell said, “rather than making myself a martyr mom. The terror of home-schooling is you have to be super  on all the time, finding crafty things to do.” What’s radical is the choice to opt out of the educational rat race that is so intense in Manhattan. “It’s hard right now, bucking a cultural trend,” said Leslie Kauffman, 44, who enrolled her 4 1/2-year-old twins in preschool and then chose not to send them because of what she sees as a trend toward too much academic pressure too early. She wants to take her time to find a school that fits them, she said, “and maybe that happens in kindergarten and maybe that happens in third grade.” Ms. Kauffman, a political organizer who stopped working when her son and daughter were 2, started the parents’ group Ms. Rendell joined last year.
garden,Two home-schooling memoirs published this year narrate choices made outside the mainstream: in “The Film Club,” David Gilmour, a Canadian film critic, lets his 15-year-old son drop out of school on the condition that he watch three films each week chosen by his father. “Homeschooling: A Family’s Journey,” was written by Gregory and Martine Millman, two American financial journalists with six home-schooled children in Plainfield, N.J., a town that presented what they considered a Hobson’s choice: a terrible public school or a rigid Catholic one. Mitchell L. Stevens, a sociologist at N.Y.U. and the author of “Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement” (Princeton, 2001), said it is not surprising that home-schooling is becoming more popular in New York City, with more than 2,600 students registered this year, up from nearly 1,600 in 2001, according to the New York City Department of Education. “In one sense it is hyperparenting, an extreme version of bourgeois parenting,” he said. Parents, he said, are anticipating a world in which children will have to be ever more flexible and creative, and some home-schooling parents believe their approach will provide that edge. But Ms. Rendell and her group aren’t thinking about admissions to Stanford, she said. It was a “distasteful atmosphere of competition” that drove one member of the parents’ group (stung by the Babble comments, she declined to give her name) to keep her 3 1/2 -year-old out of preschool; next year, she plans to pull her 6-year-old twins out of the public school gifted program they’re in and “enroll” them in what she described as “this village of many different ages and many different belief systems who have decided to spend time together.”
garden,“This is New York,” she said. “There is so much to do, and we don’t have to follow that other, complicated path.” (Ms. Kauffman offered a new term for what she and the other mothers had become: “It’s not stay-at-home mom, it’s out-in-the world mom.”) The mother of the 3 1/2-year-old and the twins said her goal for her three children was that each be able to “value his own good work, and think for himself.” She and Ms. Kauffman had gathered on a curb outside the gate of a playground in Greenwich Village, and Ms. Rendell was inside it, watching their children. As the women spoke, two of the children had gathered by the fence, and had begun a coordinated and admirably executed effort to dig a tunnel underneath it: “The Great Escape,” Village style. The mothers were delighted.
world/europe,Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Solidarity’s Foil, Dies at 90 - The New York Times Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last Communist leader of Poland, who sent tanks to crush Solidarity’s stirrings for democracy in 1981 and went on to preside over the death of the system that had nurtured him, died on Sunday in Warsaw. He was 90. The cause was complications of a stroke he suffered in early May, officials at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw said in a statement. He had spent many of his last months at the institute, where he had also been treated for cancer. General Jaruzelski led a government that was deeply unpopular in Poland through most of the 1980s. For decades before that, as a career officer and party official, he dutifully worked to entrench Soviet-directed Communism in Poland, an effort that even Stalin, its instigator, recognized as futile, likening it to “putting a saddle on a cow.” On Dec. 13, 1981, the dour general with tinted glasses, a weak jaw and a ramrod posture set in motion events that would earn him a villainous place in history. On that night, as most Poles slept, he declared martial law and ordered troops to suppress the powerful Solidarity trade union movement, whose demands for greater freedoms were alarming politburos from East Berlin to Moscow.
world/europe,“Our country is on the edge of the abyss,” he proclaimed at 6 o’clock that Sunday morning in an address to the nation as soldiers fanned out. “Strikes, strike alerts, protests have become standard. Even students are dragged into it. There are more and more examples of terror, threats, mob trials and direct coercion. Crimes, robberies and break-ins are spreading like a wave through the country.” General Jaruzelski (his full name is pronounced VOITS-yekh yaroo-ZELL-skee) complained that his government, which had recognized Solidarity, had shown the movement too much good will, tolerance and patience. He asked, “How long can one wait for a sobering up?” He did not say, as he would later, that he had been under pressure from the Soviet general secretary, Leonid I. Brezhnev, to curb Solidarity and its threat to the Communist system, or that Gen. Viktor G. Kulikov, the Russian commander of the Warsaw Pact forces, was in Warsaw at that very moment. Under martial law, power was vested in the Military Council of National Salvation, led by General Jaruzelski. The operations of Solidarity were suspended and its leaders arrested. Public gatherings were forbidden, publications were censored, thousands of people were detained and many schools and universities were closed. A strict curfew was imposed and Poland’s borders were sealed. Three days later, Polish troops fired at strikers occupying the Wujek coal mine shafts in southwestern Poland, killing nine workers. General Jaruzelski was reviled. In Western Europe, thousands turned out to protest. President Ronald Reagan moved to impose international economic sanctions against Poland.
world/europe,For the next seven years, Solidarity remained formally outlawed. The strikes subsided, but the union’s clandestine units generated an underground culture, challenging the Communist party’s monopolies with illicit newspapers, magazines, books and educational courses. By the end of 1983, however, thousands of detainees were released, and many of the most repressive measures were eased. As General Jaruzelski seemed intent on placating at least some Solidarity sympathizers, the Communist hard-liners struck out against him. Late in 1984, members of the secret police killed a popular pro-Solidarity priest, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko. Much of the country interpreted the crime as a provocation organized by party hard-liners against the liberalizing policies of General Jaruzelski. He rose to the challenge by having the police officers tried in open court, something that had never happened in any Communist country. All four were sentenced to long prison terms, another precedent. The Soviet Union itself was suffering a sustained vacuum of leadership as three leaders — Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko — died within a period of 26 months. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in Moscow in 1985 pushing reformist policies, General Jaruzelski was quick to ally himself with him. Mr. Gorbachev clearly found the general, at 62, more congenial than any of the 70- and 80-year-old party leaders in the Eastern bloc, like Nicolae Ceaucescu of Romania, Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia and Erich Honecker of East Germany. Photographs of Warsaw Pact gatherings of the period show General Jaruzelski and Mr. Gorbachev in animated discussion while the others look on glumly.
world/europe,By 1988, the atmosphere in Poland had changed even more. Opposition political groups, still technically illegal, were flourishing. And more strikes were called in Gdansk. Over the objections of hard-line party figures, General Jaruzelski took the momentous step of opening talks with many of the Solidarity leaders he had once imprisoned. After nine months, Solidarity gained the right to run candidates in parliamentary elections, the first truly free and democratic elections in any Communist state. They took place in June 1989 and resulted in the defeat of almost all the Communist candidates whose seats were contested.  A non-Communist majority formed a government. In August 1989, the Communists held their last Congress. And although General Jaruzelski was elected to the presidency, he refrained from using his considerable powers, deferring to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Solidarity. After serving only a year of his six-year term, the general resigned to open the way for a new and popular presidential election, which was won by the Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. The same general who had crushed Solidarity had permitted Poland to shed Communism relatively bloodlessly, setting a pattern that was soon to be followed by the rest of the Warsaw Pact states. He had sawed off the branch that he had been standing on for so long. Wojciech Witold Jaruzelski was born on July 6, 1923, on a large agricultural estate in eastern Poland near Lublin, where his father was the manager. The conservative, Roman Catholic family was of the old, largely impoverished nobility that identified with Poland’s struggles for independence.
world/europe,Wojciech, an only son, was sent to a prominent boarding school outside Warsaw run by priests. On Sept. 1, 1939, when German forces invaded Poland and World War II began, Wojciech and his family joined hundreds of thousands of others who fled to the east, and found work as farm laborers in Lithuania. That is where they were when Stalin, implementing his part of the deal he had struck with Hitler, took the eastern part of Poland and the Baltic States. Most of the displaced Poles, now seen by Stalin as a potential fifth column, were sent to labor camps and remote settlements in Russia. Mr. Jaruzelski’s official biography had barely any details about his life in Russia, and even in his later years he spoke and wrote sparingly about that period. But his only sister, Teresa, who was 11 when the war began, recalled in a private memoir cited by several Polish writers that their father had been sent to a labor camp in western Siberia while she, her mother and her brother were put in a settlement farther east. Their father was eventually freed and managed to find the family but, weak and ill, he died soon afterward. Mr. Jaruzelski’s survivors include his wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1961, and his daughter, Monika. After Hitler broke his pact with Stalin and attacked eastward, Mr. Jaruzelski was sent to a Soviet officer candidate school and was made an infantry officer in the Soviet-sponsored Polish force, which fought alongside the Red Army in the liberation of Warsaw, the Oder and Elbe campaigns, and the Soviet conquest of Berlin.
world/europe,Mr. Jaruzelski was wounded and decorated several times for bravery. When the war ended, he remained in uniform, fighting anti-Communist guerrillas. He joined the Communist Party, advanced in the ranks and at 33 became the youngest general in the Polish Army. In 1960, he was appointed political commissar of the Army, a post that would have needed approval by the Kremlin. General Jaruzelski was elected to the Polish Parliament in 1961 and was named minister of defense in 1968. In 1970, when workers in the Baltic ports, including Mr. Walesa, took to the streets, troops shot and killed at least 44 of them. A year after this violence, General Jaruzelski became a full member of the Politburo, and in 1973, he was promoted to four-star general. Three years later, when workers again demonstrated in protests that paved the way for the rise of Solidarity, General Jaruzelski bucked party hard-liners by proclaiming, “Polish troops will not fire on Polish workers.” Five years later, however, on his watch, that is what happened. Polish society was at boiling point. The economy remained in a shambles, dissident intellectuals were forging links with workers, and Poland’s overwhelmingly Catholic population was growing increasingly heartened by a Polish pope, John Paul II, who had challenged Soviet rule. Edward Gierek, Poland’s leader beginning in 1970, resigned as first secretary in September 1980 after he was unable to control the labor unrest. He was replaced by Stanislaw Kania, who tried to walk the thin line of appeasing Solidarity while warning that Poland must remain in the Soviet orbit.
world/europe,The clamor persisted. A group called Rural Solidarity began organizing farmers. Students demanded more liberalization of their curriculum. In Moscow, Brezhnev was not happy. On Feb. 11, 1981, General Jaruzelski was named prime minister as Mr. Kania withdrew, saying of his successor, “Now, as black clouds hang over Poland, he is the best man to whom the helm could be offered.” General Jaruzelski tried to reach accommodations with Solidarity’s leaders, with the students and farmers, and with the Catholic Church. But textile workers in Lodz staged a strike, and the economy continued to stagnate. After the Soviet Union stepped up pressure, General Jaruzelski began warning that he would order the police and army to suppress “deepening anarchist tendencies.” Later that year, Mr. Kania resigned as head of the party, and that post, too, went to General Jaruzelski. He now held unprecedented power as head of the government, the Communist Party and the military, and was poised to call out his troops. In his later years, General Jaruzelski was severely injured when a farmer, blaming him for his bankruptcy, hit him with a brick during a book signing. But he recovered and resumed efforts to redeem his reputation. In 1996 he told an audience at Kansas State University, “The structures of the state were paralyzed” and a general strike was imminent. “We were staring hunger, cold, and blackout in the face,” he said, adding. “I spent the weeks prior to taking the decision on martial law as in some horrible nightmare. I entertained thoughts of suicide. So what held me back? The sense of responsibility for my family, friends and country.”
world/europe,In 1992, a polling firm in Warsaw reported that 56 percent of those surveyed regarded his decision on martial law to have been justified. Some former Solidarity dissidents even began to speak well of him. Court cases from the Communist era dogged General Jaruzelski in his final years, however. In April 2007, he was charged with violating the Constitution by imposing martial law in 1981, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison. Separately, he faced charges stemming from the shooting of the shipyard workers in 1970. General Jaruzelski was consoled by the idea that his reputation would improve. In 1994, while taking part in a seminar on the democratization of Eastern Europe, he declared: “I am absolutely sure that the best opinion is expressed about anyone after his death. Because I am past 70, probably in the near future they will talk about me even better, when I will be in the cemetery.”
us,Pope Francis Ends Visit With Mass After Meeting Bishops and Inmates - The New York Times PHILADELPHIA — Pope Francis turned penitent and pastor Sunday on the final day of his visit to the United States, declaring himself “overwhelmed by shame” at the sexual violation of children by his clergy, embracing inmates at a local jail, urging young people to leave the loneliness of social media and bidding farewell with a huge downtown Mass. Since arriving in the United States from Cuba on Tuesday during his 10-day tour, Francis, 78, had been met by large crowds — tens of thousands during a drive through Central Park in New York, in Madison Square Garden, at a canonization in Washington; perhaps several hundred thousand on Saturday night for a potpourri of prayer, musical performances and testimonials at a festival for the Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families. Sunday’s Mass, marking the end of the meeting, on Eakins Oval in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, presented the pope on the grandest of scales, with nearly a million passing through the city’s lockdown-emptied streets into Benjamin Franklin Parkway, which was studded with Jumbotron screens. The pope departed the United States at just after 7:30 p.m. local time, aboard an American Airlines charter jet. After a week of big public statements — about fighting climate change, abolishing the death penalty, preserving religious liberty, welcoming immigrants — Francis turned his gaze on the Catholic Church with a forceful appeal for tolerance of different views. Some conservative prelates and commentators have not warmed to Francis, considering him inattentive to the church’s traditions and rules.
us,“The temptation to be scandalized by the freedom of God threatens the authenticity of faith,” the pope said, adding that it should be “vigorously rejected.” Excluding people not considered “like us” is wrong, he said. “Not only does it block conversion to the faith; it is a perversion of the faith!” Francis seemed to be suggesting that intolerance is a greater threat to the church than doctrinal impurity. “Our common house can no longer tolerate sterile divisions,” he said. The security stranglehold on central Philadelphia cast doubt on whether the crowd would pass the million mark. Yet before the Mass, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims packed the long boulevard leading to the makeshift sanctuary. Waving Mexican, Argentine, Vatican and other flags from around the world, people cheered as the pope, standing in his open-sided popemobile, took a spin around the boulevard, blessed babies and, as the choir struck up with a “Hallelujah” chorus, climbed out to meet the throng pressed against the gates. Before the Mass, Francis, a member of the Jesuit religious order, made an unscheduled stop at St. Joseph’s Univerity, a Jesuit school. Francis has made it a practice to visit with his Jesuit brothers on trips abroad. He blessed a newly-installed statue dedicated to ties between Catholics and Jews. Sunday began somberly, with Francis meeting privately with a small group of victims of clergy sexual abuse. “I am profoundly sorry that your innocence was violated by those who you trusted,” he told them, according to a transcript of his remarks released by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
technology,Daily Report: The iPhone 7 Verdict Is In - The New York Times Apple’s new phone may be the same size, but it is shrinking down lots of unexpected things. How far you are from your music, for example, or the time between you and your apps. Additionally, the width of your wallet can shrink quite a bit from the removal of money. Brian X. Chen reviews Apple’s 10th generation iPhone in Tuesday’s New York Times. The phone made its premiere to much ballyhoo last week, and goes on sale Friday. Like its predecessor, the iPhone 7 will cost about $650. The most talked-about accessory is a pair of wireless headphones that will cost $160 more. Not cheap, in other words, to buy the full experience. An editor told Brian the little wireless tubes coming out of the buds looked like he had tiny cigarettes in his ears (to me, they are more like drain pipes.) But the sound, Brian says, is quite good, and the engineering is clever. I borrowed them and realized something else: It’s a very different feeling to listen to music from earbuds without wires leading back to the phone. It’s more intimate than using either standard earbuds or wireless headphones, a direct and full relationship to your music. Immediacy does seem to be a design goal. The faster processor means getting the camera on or moving among apps is closer to instantaneous. The battery lasts longer, too, so there is less time away from the phone while it is charging.
technology,That may not seem like a lot of time saving, but it adds up, maybe even creating enough space to fill by yet more software. And, as Natasha Singer reports, more is certainly on the way: Apple has also released free software that teaches schoolchildren how to write programs. Free, that is, to any child or school that buys an Apple iPad.

fashion,Farfetch, an Online Boutique, Enjoys Its Moment - The New York Times José Neves has a certain way of shopping, one that may make him very rich. “When I go to New York, I don’t go to the department store,” he said during a recent interview from London, where he is based. “I go to the meatpacking district or in SoHo. I go into that tiny little boutique, that hole in the wall, where I discovered a selection that I can’t find anywhere else. But how do you do this at scale?” Mr. Neves, a 39-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur, has figured out an answer with his website, Farfetch.com, which provides an Open Table-like platform that connects shoppers to 300 boutiques from all over the world. He has turned his six-year-old site into a big business, and, apparently, a very appealing investment. Farfetch has raised $66 million in its latest investment round, on top of the $42.5 million it had already raised over the previous three years. The start-up had more than $160 million in sales last year and is quickly becoming one of the more intriguing players in the online shopping world. The most recent round of funding is led by a private equity investor, Vitruvian Partners. Private equity money has been flowing in the fashion world recently. Last week, Berkshire Partners became an investor in Opening Ceremony, and earlier this year, Blackstone took a stake in Versace.
fashion,Farfetch raised $20 million last year, led by Condé Nast, and the publisher has come back for more (Farfetch is one of its biggest independent digital investments). “We made our initial investment into the company over a year ago, and the tremendous growth since then led us to increase our investment through this round,” said Andrew Siegel, the head of strategy and investments for Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications. The Farfetch visitor is a well-heeled one, Mr. Neves said. The average customer spends $650 each shopping session. And those customers are looking for something a little bit different, he said — perhaps a shoe that went with “Look No. 4” from the recent Givenchy show. Bergdorf Goodman might not have it, but there’s a good chance a boutique will. Just as any disrupter would, Mr. Neves found a crack. “If you have a store in, say, Dallas or in Chicago, you only have your own local clientele,” he said. “That clientele is not shopping online as well. This is a huge missed opportunity. These boutiques in these places don’t appeal to the customer just in Chicago or Miami. They appeal to a global audience these days.” So he persuaded them to go online. Some of these boutiques have websites — some where you might be wondering whether your credit card information is actually going to be safely stowed — but many don’t. The boutiques included in Farfetch’s roster includes some heavy hitters, like the Webster in Miami and Kirna Zabête on Broome Street. Mr. Neves finds his revenue by taking a cut of each sale (he won’t say how much).
fashion,There are still some segments of the fashion world that have been slow to adapt to technology and prefer to sell only in brick-and-mortar shops (Chanel, Céline and Dior among them). Mr. Neves said that this reluctance will not last forever. “For millennial customers it’s beyond comprehension that’s there’s something available in a physical store that’s not available online,” he said. “They just don’t get it. It’s like an artist who releases an album but they cannot download it from iTunes.” When asked to compare his site to the Godzilla of online retail, Net-a-Porter, Mr. Neves bristled. “It’s different,” he said. “The overlap is 4 percent. Ninety-six percent of the products on Farfetch cannot be found on Net-a-Porter and Neiman Marcus. It’s just the way these boutiques buy. They take more risks. They take in many designers that the big department stores don’t buy.” (But no matter how many designers they take a gamble on, it’s the big labels that sell best on Farfetch: Saint Laurent, Valentino, Chloé, Givenchy and Comme des Garcons are among the biggest sellers.) Net-a-Porter’s founder, Natalie Massenet, has made Time Magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2014. Does Mr. Neves have similar dreams? Not quite, but he doesn’t underestimate his ambition. “We think what we’re building is really revolutionary,” he said. “I do think we’re changing the way we shop for fashion.”

world/canada,Trump Says He Made Up Deficit Claim in Talk with Trudeau, Baffling Canadians - The New York Times OTTAWA — First were the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Then came a trade action over a Canadian jetliner, and duties on newsprint. Most recently the United States and Canada battled over potentially crippling duties on steel and aluminum that President Trump introduced last week. And all along the two countries have been fighting over renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now comes the latest slight to Canada from its closest ally and nearest neighbor: a report by The Washington Post on Thursday that Mr. Trump boasted at a private fund-raising event that he made up an assertion that the United States had a trade deficit with Canada during a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trade with the United States is a critical part of Canada’s export-dependent economy, and the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the two countries’ economic relationship have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger within Canada. The president’s reported comments dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some Canadians. “I thought it was a dumb comment but I wasn’t surprised,” said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. “If it came from any other world leader it would be troubling. But pretty obviously he’s not a details guy and he’s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.”
world/canada,In Quebec, where Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade tactics, protectionist impulses and “America First” mantra have been met with concern and bemusement, Canadians were not impressed by what some construed as just the latest example of “lies” and obfuscation by Mr. Trump. “It is scary, as his lying has become the new normal,” said Cory Whiteduck, a 35-year-old radio host and cigarette seller in Kitigan Zibi reserve, near Maniwaki, Quebec, about 85 miles north of Ottawa. “Normally it would raise red flags, and a politician would be in trouble. It is not a productive way of doing things or a good mentality.” Michel Pronovost, a retired construction worker, said Mr. Trudeau was, by now, accustomed to Mr. Trump’s creativity with the facts. “Do you really think he didn’t know that Trump was lying to him?” he asked. “Of course, he knew.” But he added that while Mr. Trump’s protectionism was bad for Canada, he was “trying to protect his own people, just like China or any country would do.” Some Americans denounced Mr. Trump’s admission, including Bruce A. Heyman, the United States’ ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama, who spoke out in a series of posts on Twitter. “Creating a crisis where none existed before is no way to run our country,” Mr. Heyman posted. “Canada is our best friend and don’t ever forget it! We should never put the relationship at risk.” He added: “When I left it was the best relationship the U.S.A. had in the world. The President is casually throwing Canada under the bus and this is just wrong.”
world/canada,Determining trade balances is not straightforward. According to the United States trade office, the United States had a $12.1 billion deficit in the trade in goods with Canada in 2016. But that was more than offset by a $24.6 billion surplus in the United States’ favor in trade in services. In a statement, the Canadian government noted the United States trade representative’s finding of a surplus. Mr. Trudeau’s office declined to comment. On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump was not backing down. On Twitter he wrote: “We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do … they almost all do … and that’s how I know!” Trade disputes between Canada and the United States have not run a straight course. After Washington introduced the duties on steel and aluminum, it suspended them for Canada. But officials in Mr. Trump’s administration insist that the United States runs a steel trade deficit with Canada, even though figures from both governments show that trade is balanced. The trade action over the new Canadian jetliner was ultimately dropped, but not before threatening the future of Bombardier, one of Canada’s largest industrial companies. After demanding that the North American Free Trade Agreement be reopened, Mr. Trump’s negotiators presented a list of demands that Canada has declared unacceptable. Mr. Trudeau has said that Canada is prepared to abandon Nafta rather than accept a “bad deal.”

His incubator for bacteria is an old Styrofoam shipping box with a heating mat and thermometer that he has modified into a thermostat. He uses a pressure cooker to sterilize instead of an autoclave. Some instruments are fashioned from coffee cans. In the burgeoning world of citizen science, where the ethos is closer to scout manual than peer-reviewed journal, Mr. Garvey, a 26-year-old geneticist who worked in a cancer research center for about four years after earning a graduate degree, is something of a hero. He is perhaps best known for inventing the DremelFuge, a small centrifuge that can be fabricated by a 3-D printer. His plans are freely available online, so anybody who has the desire and the resources to make one can do so. He and other scientific improvisers, or bio-hackers, are part of a movement called DIYbio, short for do-it-yourself biology, which got its official start in 2008 with DIYBio.org, an online hub for sharing ideas. The site has grown to more than 2,000 members since its inception. “I want to generate the sort of tools that make it easy to do DIYbio at home,” Mr. Garvey said. One of the movement’s rallying points is Genspace, a nonprofit laboratory in Brooklyn that is open to members of the public, regardless of scientific background. Since it opened in 2010, on the seventh floor of an old bank building, similar labs have sprouted in Boston and San Francisco.
science,Genspace has roughly a dozen members, and each pays $100 a month to cover rent and what laboratory people call consumables: chemical agents, disposable tubes and other paraphernalia that need to be replaced regularly. The initial concept, said Daniel Grushkin, a journalist based in Brooklyn who was a founder of Genspace, is similar to the ethos of open-source software development: If you get as many brains as possible working collaboratively on biotechnology, “you might get a really good idea.” The idea of amateurs doing their own biology has raised fears about both deliberate bioterrorism and the unintentional creation of a deadly disease. But making a new and virulent pathogen is far from easy, and the DIYbio community has adopted a set of safety standards to minimize such risks. “Within a very narrow scope, it’s possible that somebody could cause harm,” Mr. Garvey said. “But they could only cause a disease to emerge if they were working with disease.” Genspace has a strict policy against working with anything that can infect humans, and it has established a safety review board of experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the United States Department of Health and Human Services and other institutions to approve proposals for new experiments. To DIY enthusiasts, one of the most frustrating things can be the pace. Biology involves working with organisms that, like infants, need attention at specific times.
science,“So much of biology is just waiting,” said Charlie Schick, a Boston-based member of DIYbio who runs a blog called Molecularist. And getting a temperature wrong or adding an incorrect chemical means that an experiment has to be started all over again. An even bigger hurdle is all the expensive gear: Cheap centrifuges and polymerase chain-reaction machines cost about $3,000 each. Genspace, for example, could not have acquired all of its equipment with membership dues alone: A founder and the current president, Ellen D. Jorgensen, previously worked at a private lab that decided to offload equipment after the recession forced it to downsize. She volunteered to take the jettisoned instruments. Still, some bio-hackers think that what is needed is simpler and cheaper lab equipment. “People vastly overestimate the cost of running a biotech lab,” Mr. Garvey said. The cost of his home laboratory? Four thousand euros, he said — about $5,000.
us/politics,Spending Dispute Leaves a Senate Deal Elusive - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  With a possible default on government obligations just days away, Senate Democratic leaders — believing they have a political advantage in the continuing fiscal impasse — refused Sunday to sign on to any deal that reopens the government but locks in budget cuts for next year. The disagreement extended the stalemate that has kept much of the government shuttered for two weeks and threatens to force a federal default. The core of the dispute is about spending, and how long a stopgap measure that would reopen the government should last. Democrats want the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration to last only through mid-November; Republicans want them to last as long as possible. The Democrats’ demand shows a newfound aggressiveness. Previously, they had favored a so-called clean bill that would reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling without any policy changes attached. With Republicans on the defensive, it remains unclear whether the Democrats are using a negotiating ploy to raise the likelihood that any final deal will include their priorities as well as the Republicans’. Democrats said Sunday that Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader — who spoke only briefly by telephone — were inching forward, and that a breakthrough was possible before the debt default deadline on Thursday.
us/politics,“They had a good conversation,” Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, said on Sunday evening. “They are moving closer together, and I’m hopeful the Senate can save the day.” Republicans accused Democrats of accepting nothing short of capitulation without offering anything in return. “The Democrats keep moving the goal posts,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, one of the lead Republican negotiators. “Decisions within the Democratic conference are constantly changing.” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, warned on the CBS News program “Face the Nation” that the Democrats “better understand something.” “What goes around comes around,” he said, “and if they try to humiliate Republicans, things change in American politics.” A rally on the National Mall, led by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, was intended to show that Tea Party activists — supporters of the House Republicans who forced the shutdown over their opposition to the new health care law — were in no mood to give in. Some waved Confederate flags and called for President Obama to be impeached. The dispute may involve debt ceiling technicalities, but at the core of the fight is a more fundamental question: with polls showing that Republicans are carrying the brunt of the blame for the shutdown, can Democrats demand total surrender, or should they offer concessions to complete the deal? “You can’t just demand pure capitulation,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. “Negotiations don’t work that way.”
us/politics,Republicans once said that they would finance the government only if the president’s health care law was gutted. A bipartisan Senate framework drafted by Ms. Collins and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, started with a face-saving move for Republicans of a repeal of a tax on medical devices that helps pay for the Affordable Care Act. When Senate Democratic leaders objected, that was tempered to a two-year delay of the tax. Republicans had also insisted on tightening income verification rules for the health care law’s subsidized insurance exchanges. Now Democrats are rewriting that language as well. “What am I getting?” Ms. Collins said. “I’m serious. I’ve bent over backward.” Democrats have agreed to engage in formal budget negotiations — where, they acknowledge, Republicans may have the upper hand once the government is reopened and the threat of default is lifted. Both sides say they want a deal that reduces the deficit over the long term. Republicans have one advantage: if no deal is reached during those talks, the next round of automatic cuts, even deeper than the first, go into force on Jan. 1. “We know that come 10 years from now, Medicare is not sustainable financially,” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, said on the NBC News program “Meet the Press.” “We’ve got to do something.” “And I have to say to the Republican side, ‘For goodness’s sakes, we cannot find some savings, closing some loopholes, quote, raising revenue?’ Well, of course we can,” he said.
us/politics,The Collins plan would maintain sequestration-level spending through Jan. 15, when formal budget negotiators would be required to complete a House-Senate agreement on spending and taxation over the next decade. That date was already a concession. Ms. Collins, along with Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both Republicans, initially wanted to finance the government for six months at those levels. The initial proposal by Ms. Collins would also have extended the debt ceiling only to Nov. 15, but at the request of Senate Democratic leaders, she and Mr. McConnell pushed it back to Jan. 31. Mr. McConnell formally endorsed the Collins proposal on Sunday. “It would reopen the government, prevent a default, provide the opportunity for additional budget negotiations around Washington’s long-term debt, and maintain the commitment that Congress made to reduce Washington spending,” he said in a statement. “It’s time for Democrat leaders to take ‘yes’ for an answer.” But Democratic leaders have balked, and they flexed their muscle Sunday with a group of Democratic and independent senators negotiating with Ms. Collins. Ms. Collins said eight Democrats were now involved in negotiations, including Mr. Manchin, and Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats. “The Democratic leadership is clearly very strong and has a lot of sway over its members,” Ms. Collins said.
us/politics,Underscoring those concerns, six of the senators negotiating with Ms. Collins — Mr. Manchin, Mr. King, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana — released a joint statement acknowledging involvement in the talks but saying they could not support the proposal “in its current form.” “There are negotiations,” they said, “but there is no agreement.”
business/dealbook,Britain Says It’s Committed to Sale of Lloyds Stake - The New York Times LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it remained committed to selling a stake in the Lloyds Banking Group to retail investors, and to exiting its holdings in the lender by next year. Harriett Baldwin, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government, which has a 9.2 percent stake in the bank, would offer some of its holdings to retail investors this year. The government took a stake in the lender after it provided a bailout of 17 billion pounds, or $24 billion at current exchange rates, to Lloyds during the financial crisis. On Tuesday, Lloyds paid a dividend of £130 million to the government, bringing the total the government has recovered to more than £16.8 billion. The government delayed a sale to retail investors in January because of turmoil in the financial markets, the second delay since 2014. “I am determined to build on this success by making Lloyds shares available to the public this year,” Ms. Baldwin said in a news release, “so that we can build a share-owning democracy and continue to reduce our national debt.” The Treasury said it expected to have fully sold off its Lloyds holdings this year or next. The government owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds after the bailout, but it has reduced its holdings as the bank’s prospects have improved.
business/dealbook,Since October, when the government announced plans for a retail offering, the Lloyds share price has fallen 13 percent, and the stock is now trading at an average below the 73.6 pence a share the British government had paid. Shares of Lloyds rose about 1 percent to 67.30 pence in afternoon trading in London on Tuesday.
us,Judge Bars Black Lives Matter Organizers From Mall Protest - The New York Times A judge in Minnesota granted in part a request by the Mall of America for a restraining order against Black Lives Matter activists who have scheduled a demonstration at the shopping mecca on Wednesday, one of the busiest days of the year. The decision bars three of the organizers — Michael McDowell, Miski Noor and Kandace Montgomery — from participating in the protest. Black Lives Matter has vowed to go forward with the demonstration as planned. The mall’s complaint had included the group itself as a defendant, but Judge Karen A. Janisch of Hennepin County ruled that it was not an entity capable of being sued. “The Court does not have a sufficient basis to issue an injunction as to Black Lives Matters (sic) or to unidentified persons who may be acting as its agents or in active concert with the Black Lives Matters movement,” she wrote. The decision, Judge Janisch noted, “should not be interpreted as authorizing or permitting others to engage in political demonstration at the Mall of America without the express permission of the Mall of America.” Mall of America, in the city of Bloomington near Minneapolis, had also asked the court to force the Black Lives Matter members to post messages on social media informing their followers that the event was canceled. That request was denied.
us,The national Black Lives Matter movement has been especially active in Minneapolis, where Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old unarmed black man, was fatally shot by a police officer on Nov. 15. Activists have demanded the release of videotapes related to the shooting and the prosecution of the officers involved. Five people were shot outside a police precinct in Minneapolis during the ninth day of protests on Nov. 24. The police arrested four people in connection with the attack, and activists have called for federal terrorism charges against them. Last December, an estimated 3,000 protesters shut down part of the Mall of America as part of a demonstration against police brutality. On the last Saturday before Christmas, protesters shouted, “While you’re on your shopping spree, black people cannot breathe,” The Associated Press reported. Officers in riot gear cleared them away. In November, a judge dismissed charges against the organizers, ruling that the demonstration was peaceful and “not subversive.” They had faced misdemeanor charges related to trespassing, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. The judge kept in place trespassing charges against some individual participants. In a letter to organizers in December, the mall’s management team said anyone participating in a demonstration “will be subject to removal from the property and potential arrest.”
technology,Kahoot App Brings Urgency of a Quiz Show to the Classroom - The New York Times Kahoot, an online quiz system from Norway that is fast gaining market share in schools across the United States, plays out like a television game show spliced with a video game. Cast in the role of game host, teachers introduce a multiple-choice quiz — on, say, plant life or English grammar. Using the Kahoot platform, they project one quiz question at a time onto a whiteboard or screen at the front of their classrooms. Players typically have 30 seconds to click an answer on their laptops, tablets or smartphones. They earn points for correct choices, and extra points for clicking faster. During the answer period, Kahoot emits a catchy countdown tune, reminiscent of retro video games like Monkey Island. A gong sounds when time is up, and the classroom board immediately tallies the class’s correct and incorrect answers. Next, a leaderboard appears, ranking the top five students by points accrued. Kahoot’s gamelike features and easy-to-use format have helped turn it into a classroom phenomenon. Of the 55 million elementary and secondary school students in the United States, about 20 million used Kahoot last month, the company said. “It’s fun. Everyone is doing it. It pulls all the children in,” Tosh McGaughy, a digital learning specialist at the Birdville Independent School District in Haltom City, Tex., told me recently. “They get competitive and excited.” Still, it’s too early to tell whether Kahoot will ultimately improve learning for students or simply provide edutainment.
technology,“Are they engaged in the content after the game is over, two days later, or at some point in time when they are not having all the bells and whistles going off?” asked Heather Collins, a digital learning researcher and chairwoman of the behavioral and social sciences department at Trident Technical College in Charleston, S.C. Kahoot, a play on “in cahoots,” capitalizes on a number of education trends. One is “engagement,” or the belief that the more an activity interests students, the more motivated they will be to learn. Another is “gamification,” the practice of applying elements from games to nongame realms. “It is a simple game-show format,” Johan Brand, the chief executive of Kahoot, said in a phone interview. The spoonful-of-sugar approach to learning can be applied regardless of subject matter. “We as a company are not interested in what they are teaching,” he said. “We are interested in how they are playing.” And many students are playing to win, partly by competing on speed. “They think the cellphone is faster,” Ms. McGaughy, the digital learning specialist, said. “So the competitive kids use the phone.” The site also lends itself to social sharing. Students are already posting their Kahoot ranking on social networks — or group-texting it, even when they do not come in first. Here is a student posting on Twitter as @beansalaad: “I finished 5th in the @GetKahoot quiz ‘How does the Constitution protect freedom of expression’ out of 22 players, with 4,754 points!”
technology,But the constant competition and quantification could also be off-putting. “Some people love being ranked and having points and status,” says Neil Selwyn, a professor of education at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who studies how schools use technology. “But I bet it doesn’t appeal to every student in the same way.” Mr. Brand, a digital marketing and experience designer, founded Kahoot with two colleagues in 2012. It has since raised about $6.5 million from its own employees, from the Research Council of Norway and from Northzone, a venture capital firm that was one of the first investors in Spotify, the streaming music service. The founders focused first on the American school market, introducing the product in 2013. Mr. Brand previously developed games services for companies like Daimler and Unilever. He also worked on a marketing project to help family-run inns, scattered throughout the Norwegian fjords, become more collaborative — by talking up their fellow inn owners to guests rather than competing with one another on hotel amenities. Guests found the owners’ stories so compelling, Mr. Brand said, that they grew more interested in visiting other fjord hotels. Mr. Brand’s expertise in identifying stimuli that can trigger powerful emotions came in handy as the co-founders were working on Kahoot. He said that some of his thinking was also inspired by a book titled “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” “We are using music, timers and points, these emotional triggers,” Mr. Brand said. “We are not just designing for the logical sense,” but creating “for the emotional side — where you fall in love with what is going on.”
technology,The brand’s novel social-learning story notwithstanding, Kahoot seems like a bit of a throwback to a more old-fashioned pedagogical approach: behaviorism. This is the idea of educators shaping student behavior by handing out gold stars, stickers, points and the like. Readers who attended school in the pre-laptop era may have played classroom games like multiplication bingo, an offline exercise in which students win acclaim or prizes for being the quickest to remember their times tables. Today, students may use Ascend Math, a learning app that rewards students who complete a level by letting them play short video games. Of course, points, bells, video game leaderboards and all sorts of other brain stimuli can become habit-forming — like ice cream. That does not make them good for students. “If you get an ice cream sundae every day after dinner, you are going to expect that ice cream sundae every day after dinner,” Professor Collins, the learning researcher, said of Kahoot. Mr. Brand said Kahoot was not intended for teachers to use with their classes every day, but once or twice weekly. “Life cannot just be a Kahoot,” Mr. Brand joked. “Actually, that would be very boring.” More seriously, Mr. Brand said: “From the outside, Kahoot may look frivolous. But if you are a teacher, you can see students are emotionally engaged in the material.”
technology,He added that the start-up was more focused on looking at how the quiz system affected students’ interest in attending school and learning, rather than their academic performances. A small study by the start-up of college students in Norway concluded that there was no significant difference in test results between those who took a Kahoot quiz and those who took a traditional quiz on paper. But the Kahooters reported enjoying their experience more. “We are looking at emotional engagement,” Mr. Brand said. Kahoot is free for educators, who can upload their own questionnaires or choose among several million quizzes that other users have posted. The company has begun to generate revenue by charging publishers to include quizzes with their material on the site. It also offers a fee-based service for companies to use Kahoot for consumer marketing or to engage employees in corporate information. Many educators run Kahoot to get a quick snapshot of how their class is doing. “They can get immediate feedback on how many students answered correctly and which questions students are still struggling with,” said Susan Rieke-Smith, the superintendent of Springfield Public Schools in Springfield, Ore. “Then they adjust the lesson plans for the next day based on that data.” Some teachers also use Kahoot to introduce a lesson, as a way of piquing students’ interest in absorbing unfamiliar material.
technology,Nolan Sullivan, a social studies teacher at La Salle Academy, a Catholic high school for boys in Manhattan, prefers to use Kahoot without the video game music or the gong. He says he often asks his ninth graders to devise their own questions on subjects they learn in class, such as medieval or Islamic history. Then he incorporates them into the quiz. Asking his students to create their own questions, he says, gives them extra motivation to understand their lessons. It also has them coming back for more. “When we are doing test prep, my students will say, ‘Mr. Sullivan, are we Kahooting tomorrow?’” he told me. “Kahooting is an actual word now.”

world/asia,Uzbekistan Reveals That Ex-Leader’s Daughter Is in Custody - The New York Times MOSCOW — The office of Uzbekistan’s prosecutor general confirmed Friday that Gulnara I. Karimova, the once-powerful daughter of the man who led Uzbekistan for more than two decades, was in state custody. Ms. Karimova disappeared from public view in 2014, and was convicted the next year of extortion and embezzlement charges, but until Friday’s announcement the Uzbek authorities had not commented on her status. The prosecutors said that Ms. Karimova was currently in custody, and that she was facing additional criminal charges. They did not specify the location or conditions of her detention. Ms. Karimova, 45, was once one of the most influential public figures in Uzbekistan, second only to her father, Islam Karimov, the authoritarian leader of the Central Asian country from 1989, when it was still a Soviet republic, until his death last year. Often appearing at odds with her country’s ultraconservative culture, Ms. Karimova actively promoted herself as an international pop star and designer, performing under the stage name Googoosha. She also served as Uzbekistan’s ambassador to Spain and as its permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva. Ms. Karimova had been considered among the likeliest successors to her father. Her good fortune seemed to end, however, after she engaged in a public feud with her younger sister, Lola, and her mother, Tatyana, in 2014. In 2013, the United States opened an investigation into large-scale bribes she purportedly accepted from Russian and Swedish telecom companies.
world/asia,A United States diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks in 2010 described Ms. Karimova as “a robber baron” who “crushed” many businesspeople in Uzbekistan. In their statement, the Uzbek prosecutors said that Ms. Karimova was now facing charges of hiding almost $2 billion she received as part of an “organized crime group” for lobbying, the illegal sale of telecom licenses and land plots and other activities. The investigators also said they were seeking to freeze more than $1.5 billion in assets held by Ms. Karimova in 12 countries. The assets include a villa in Switzerland, houses, apartments and villas in Britain, residences and a castle in Paris and an airplane in Malta. “I personally think that she will be sentenced to a longer term under the second case,” said Daniil Kislov, the Moscow-based editor of Ferghana, a website that tracks developments in Central Asia. “They will never let her out of Uzbekistan,” Mr. Kislov said. “She knows too much.” During almost three decades in power, Mr. Karimov ruthlessly turned Uzbekistan into one of the world’s most isolated and repressive nations. Local news media outlets were under tight control, and few foreign media organizations were allowed inside the country. In 2005, Mr. Karimov oversaw the massacre of hundreds of protesters in the city of Andijon. Mr. Karimov was succeeded by his ally and former prime minister, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who announced a number of changes, including easing restrictions on the currency market and attempts to build bridges with Uzbekistan’s neighbors in the region. However, analysts have been skeptical about the new leader’s willingness to make substantive, lasting reforms.
books/review,Not Your Father's Roadmaster - The New York Times FROM A BUICK 8 By Stephen King. 356 pp. New York: Scribner. $28. IT must get exhausting, inventing monstrous evils year in and year out, especially the sort of ancient, supernatural forces that start by insinuating themselves into the fabric of everyday life and grow to threaten everything sane and decent before being vanquished, against all odds, by a valiant band of unlikely heroes. You can see why Stephen King, who has done this many times, might get tired of it, might look around him at a world that certainly enjoys no shortage of terrors as it is, and write a book like ''From a Buick 8.'' It's still a horror novel, but it's one that gnaws away at the very premises of the horror novel. It knows what you want and expect from it, but it deftly gives you something else instead, something equally worth having and all the more pleasing for being a surprise.
books/review,The novels King has published since 1999, when he was struck and nearly killed by a distracted motorist while walking along a Maine road, have been rattletrap affairs powered only by the redoubtable dynamo of his storytelling. ''From a Buick 8'' is a sleeker machine, even if at first it seems to revolve around the unexciting evil-car motif of King's 1983 novel ''Christine.'' The Buick in question, a 1954 Roadmaster in midnight blue, pulls up at a service station outside a small town in western Pennsylvania in 1979, driven by a mysterious man in black who promptly vanishes. Everyone who sees the car instantly knows that it's ''wrong.'' It's got an exhaust system made out of glass and a dashboard full of phony controls, for example -- and it just gives people the creeps. The service station turns this problematic vehicle over to Troop D of the Pennsylvania State Police, and they stash it near their barracks in an outbuilding they call Shed B, where it stays for the rest of the book, causing trouble.
books/review,That's the story, boiled down to its bones, and story is usually the main attraction in King's fiction. ''From a Buick 8,'' though, is a phenomenon almost as exotic as the Buick itself: a King novel to read for voice and atmosphere, not plot. It's told mostly in the first person, by various members of Troop D, who are relating the history of their 23-year stewardship of the Buick. Their audience is Ned Wilcox, the 18-year-old son of Curtis, a trooper who was hit and killed by a drunken driver while he was standing next to a truck he'd stopped by the side of a two-lane highway. Ned has been hanging around the barracks doing chores, and when he asks about the gleaming vintage car out in Shed B, Sandy Dearborn, sergeant commanding, decides to initiate him into the troop's secret. ''When you got right down to it,'' Sandy explains, ''it wasn't a 1954 at all. Or a Buick. Or even a car.'' It's soon obvious that the Buick is a conduit to another dimension. Sometimes it spits out a repulsive creature or two from that world, and then it will suck in a gerbil, a frog or, alas, a human being from ours (the first casualty is Curtis's partner). The transplants that emerge on this end rapidly die and decompose. For complicated reasons, the troop's commander (Sandy's predecessor, Tony Schoondist) wants the whole thing kept quiet.
books/review,It's hard to care much about the Buick, though; you can sense King's own indifference. Ned, patently a stand-in for the typical King reader, pesters Sandy for answers, but the older man resists. ''Tell me a story,'' he imagines the boy demanding, ''one that has a beginning and a middle and an end where everything is explained.'' They wrestle over how the story gets told. Ned doesn't appreciate the details or recognize the importance in how the Buick ''eventually became just another part of our day, like writing reports or testifying in court or cleaning puke off the floor mats of a cruiser or Steve Devoe's Polish jokes.'' ''I kept trying to give him a context,'' Sandy adds, ''and he kept repudiating it.'' King succeeds where Sandy (initially) fails: he shows you the mundane heroism of the troopers' lives and makes you care about that, not the spook show in Shed B. No horror emerging from the Buick can be worse than the nightmares of their job -- ''the smell of blood and busted guts and spilled gasoline and boiled rubber . . . like some hideous old acquaintance who would never move out of town; you smelled it and knew that somebody was dead or almost dead, that somebody else would be crying and screaming, that you were going to find a shoe -- hopefully not a child's, but all too often it was -- lying in the road.''
books/review,Then there's the legacy of their work and the unhealthy habits acquired to take off its edge, the retired troopers with oxygen tanks and drinking problems, the suicides -- all arising from the corrosive despair and stealthy self-hatred that stoic men are prone to and that King writes about so expertly. In one piercing scene (a scene any writer would be proud of), a trooper tries to persuade the female passenger in a truck he's pulled over to press charges against the man he's just seen punching her. He's almost sure she won't do it, tries speaking softly, wonders if barking orders wouldn't work better (''Doing what men said had pretty much become her life's work''), pities her, pleads with her, realizes he's lost her and thinks: ''She'd sit there until hell froze over'' or until he got angry enough ''to do something that would get me in trouble later. Like hit her. Because I wanted to hit her. If I hit her, at least she'd know I was there.'' And then, of course, there's Ned's father's pointless death. King isn't a subtle writer, and in case you miss the dozen or so times that someone proclaims that there are no answers or explanations -- either to the mysteries of the Buick or to the random tragedies of ordinary existence for which it stands -- he comes in at the end with an author's note to tell you the book's about ''the essentially indecipherable quality of life's events.'' And, yes, ''From a Buick 8'' presents a sentimental view of police work, hardly the whole truth, as some black drivers in New Jersey can surely testify. Yet it feels true enough in what it does choose to say, and in the reticent intimacy of this group of working-class men and women, with their shared everyday reality of coffee mugs, paperwork, grabbing a smoke out back, pulling over a truck with a flapping retread, peril, death and cleaning up afterward.
sports/football,Chargers and Raiders Stick Together in Los Angeles Plan - The New York Times The San Diego Chargers and the Oakland Raiders remain committed to building a stadium together in Carson, Calif., if owners of the other N.F.L. franchises approve the teams’ applications to move to the Los Angeles area. In a letter sent last week to the owners’ committee overseeing the league’s return to the Los Angeles area, the country’s second-largest market, the Chargers’ chairman, Dean Spanos, dismissed an overture by the St. Louis Rams’ owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, who said he was willing to let a second team invest in a rival stadium that he hoped to build in Inglewood, Calif. “Nothing in Stan’s letter gives me any reason to reconsider my partnership with Mark Davis and our chosen stadium site,” Mr. Spanos wrote, referring to the owner of the Raiders. “I firmly believe that the proposal we have jointly made is in the best interests of the entire league and is in complete compliance with the league’s relocation policies.” Mr. Davis sent a similar letter to the Los Angeles committee. For months, owners have been weighing the merits of the two projects. Mr. Kroenke said he would like to build a domed stadium that would be a part of a larger entertainment district in Inglewood, while Mr. Spanos and Mr. Davis would construct an outdoor stadium in Carson.
sports/football,In late November, Mr. Kroenke wrote to the owners on the Los Angeles committee to say that he would allow a second team to help pay for the costs of building his stadium in return for half the football-related revenue. But the second team would have no say in the design of the stadium and would not share in any profits from other elements of the project. The letter was viewed by some league executives as an effort to fracture the partnership between Mr. Spanos and Mr. Davis. The two owners, though, recruited Robert A. Iger, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, to help build their stadium, should it win approval. Relocation applications are expected to be filed next month. The owners could vote on them as early as Jan. 12, when they meet again in Houston. At the meeting, the owners will also consider efforts by the cities of Oakland, San Diego and St. Louis to keep their teams from moving. According to the league’s relocation guidelines, a team cannot leave its home market if there is a credible effort by its host city to keep the team there. Of the three cities, St. Louis has the most developed plan, which includes a $1 billion stadium on the banks of the Mississippi River. An application to relocate requires approval by the owners of at least 24 teams. While a few owners have expressed a preference for one of the two proposals, most owners remain uncommitted.

business,Next Stop for Preet Bharara, Fired Prosecutor? His Brother’s Media Firm - The New York Times Since Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, was abruptly fired in March by President Trump, speculation has swirled about what he would do next. Would he join a white-shoe law firm, as many former prosecutors do? Would he run for office? As it turns out, Mr. Bharara is becoming something of a media Renaissance man. On Monday, he will officially announce that he is joining his younger brother’s media company, Some Spider Studios. He is writing a book. And he has not stopped tweeting. Mr. Bharara will become an executive vice president at Some Spider, which Vinit Bharara started in 2014. He will also host a podcast called “Stay Tuned With Preet.” (The phrase “Stay Tuned” will sound familiar to anyone who attended his news conferences.) The podcast, which is scheduled to begin airing in the coming months, will explore justice and fairness issues and provide in-depth analysis on legal cases. Mr. Bharara also expects to write articles for Some Spider’s news and entertainment website, Cafe, and he and Vinit Bharara plan to introduce a conference, Cafe Con, next year. As the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York for more than seven years, Preet Bharara, 48, was perhaps the most powerful federal prosecutor in the country. He prosecuted politicians on both sides of the aisle and earned a reputation for aggressively going after insider trading on Wall Street. He has repeatedly said he has no plans to seek political office, but that has not stopped the murmurings.
business,So joining an upstart media company and hosting a podcast might not seem the next logical step in Mr. Bharara’s career. Vinit Bharara, 45, said he projected that Some Spider would have more than $12 million in revenue this year and double that next year. And the company has made a bunch of hires in the last several months, including a new creative director who previously worked at BuzzFeed. One of its websites, Scary Mommy, is a hit among the parenting set. Preet Bharara does have other postprosecutorial plans. In April, he joined the New York University School of Law as a distinguished scholar in residence. He is also working on a book about the search for justice, which the publisher Alfred A. Knopf plans to publish in early 2019. Mr. Bharara acknowledged in a joint interview with his brother at Some Spider’s headquarters in the Flatiron district of Manhattan that joining the company did not represent the typical career path for a former federal prosecutor. But he said he was drawn to Some Spider because it would allow him an unfettered platform to pursue what he has always done: raise issues of justice and hold people accountable. “It’s an extension of all the things I have been doing, although I no longer have the authority that I had before,” he said. If Mr. Bharara’s plans seem unconventional, it is worth noting that his interest in the media is not new. In the past, he has publicly expressed support for investigative journalism and has cited reporters’ work that led to prosecutions by his office.
business,Some Spider also gives him an opportunity to work not only with his brother but also with their childhood friend Marc Lore, a primary investor in the company. Mr. Lore and Vinit Bharara started an online diapers store, Diapers.com, in 2005 and later sold its parent company to Amazon for about $540 million. (Preet Bharara held a small investment in the company.) Around the time that Vinit Bharara founded Some Spider, Mr. Lore started Jet.com, an online bulk retailer that he sold last year to Walmart for $3.3 billion. Of course, both brothers said they hoped Preet’s involvement would give Some Spider more heft and recognition. “This is a business,” Vinit Bharara said. “Clearly, I see how this is going to benefit Cafe.” There may also be another reason Preet Bharara wants to work with his brother: more job security.
books/review,How a Philosophy Professor Found Love in a Hidden Library - The New York Times AMERICAN PHILOSOPHYA Love StoryBy John Kaag259 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26. In 2008, a young University of Massachusetts Lowell philosophy professor named John Kaag set out on a fateful road trip. He was driving to Chocorua, N.H., to help organize a conference on William James, who had owned a home in the nearby White Mountains. Stopping for coffee in town, he admitted to a 93-year-old local what he did for a living. This old man had grown up on the estate of another philosophy professor, William Ernest Hocking, a once powerful and wealthy pillar of Harvard in the early 20th century. On Hocking’s property still stood his private library, a custom-built free-standing pile. Kaag, invited to look in, instantly recognized the early publications of the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, on whom Kaag had written his doctoral dissertation — books inscribed by Peirce himself. He found William James’s reading in preparation for “The Varieties of Religious Experience,” with James’s marginalia and annotations. He found signed gift copies from Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman and Robert Frost, which had ended up in Hocking’s hands. Then there were the masterpieces of European philosophy since the 17th century: Descartes’s “Discourse on Method” in a first edition; the first English translation of Hobbes’s “De Cive”; and first editions of significant works by Kant. The books were moldering under inches of dust in an unheated, uncooled limbo.
books/review,All this would be a wonderful event in the life of any professor, especially one as gifted and skilled as Kaag in the history of 19th-century philosophy. (One of his previous works concerns Ella Lyman Cabot, “one of the few women of classical American philosophy.”) It would not seem to make for a popular book. But Kaag used the discovery of the library as an excuse to transform his own life. The son of an alcoholic father who had abandoned his family and recently died — and now stuck in a too-early marriage to his freshman-year college girlfriend, even though “I, at least, didn’t have a clue how to be in erotic love” — Kaag had sought a guiding light. He had followed an “ancestor cult” for years, digging through Emerson’s and William James’s and Thoreau’s papers at Harvard, visiting the tourist traps of Concord and Cambridge, to no profound effect. But West Wind, the familiar name for Hocking’s estate, swept all before it. It pushed Kaag finally into rebellion. “In the following months I started cheating on my wife with a roomful of books.” Kaag sneaks back and forth to New Hampshire. His wife catches him with out-of-state gas station charges on their credit card bill. As she offers to come along on future trips, he resists. He works up the nerve to sell his wedding ring for $278 at “a pawnshop outside of Derry,” and separates from his wife on the eve of his 30th birthday. (She remarried and moved to North Dakota.) Kaag is left alone with his hopeless plan to archive and catalog the books and find a university to rescue them. He is also left, he slowly realizes, in unrequited love with a married colleague, Carol, who will ultimately be competing with him for tenure. He invites her to visit him up at the library.
books/review,This is the dramatic plot of “American Philosophy: A Love Story.” The pleasure of this unusual work, however, and the bulk of its pages, belong to short biographical accounts and reflections on the philosophers, poets, novelists and even bygone political figures whose volumes Kaag finds on the Hocking library shelves. He gives us compelling glimpses of William James, Thoreau, Descartes, Dante, Plato, Coleridge, T.H. Huxley, Peirce, Whitehead, Josiah Royce, Schelling, Hegel, Lydia Maria Child, Jane Addams, May Sarton, Pearl Buck, Gabriel Marcel and others. These mini-lectures are often comically connected to evocations of where Kaag finds and reads each person’s book. He reads Cudworth and Peirce in the kitchen, and unfolds the mysteries of free will over breakfast: “I’d spent more than enough time thinking about determinism. I finished my toast.” Kaag’s accounts are accurate, engaging and scrupulous. They show profound learning. They’re also genuinely entertaining, recapturing lost details of thinkers’ personal lives without sensationalism. The further you go on in the book, and the more of Kaag’s skillful miniatures you take in, the deeper it becomes. You realize he is also making an unconventional argument for who was right, and who was wrong, in the classical tradition of American philosophy from about 1830 to 1930, in Transcendentalism and Pragmatism and Idealism and beyond. It is an argument strikingly suited to our time.
books/review,The first transfer of allegiance Kaag makes is from the ethos of “self-reliance” in Ralph Waldo Emerson to a subtler notion of “self-cultivation” from his disciple, Henry David Thoreau. “My life would become an experiment in Thoreauvian self-cultivation, a project that had always struck me as more manageable and realistic than trying to embody Emerson’s ‘self-reliance.’ ” Kaag then goes further with Thoreau, to a cultivation of the world beyond the self called “husbandry.” “Thoreau never became a husband, in the usual sense of the word, but he maintained that husbandry — the simple act of tending one’s own garden — was the proper alternative to a life of modern alienation.” Far beyond “cultivating one’s garden,” à la Voltaire, this husbandry demands a shared and mutual cultivation with others. Kaag relocates it to the metaphorical power of Charles Sanders Peirce and his wife joyfully “gardening . . . together on their estate in Milford, Pa.,” as “Peirce’s favorite example of loving care” — a cultivation, now, for couples. For Kaag, it is “Peirce’s belief in the generative force of love” that “carried the torch of American philosophy into the 20th century.” “Husbandry,” it becomes clear, will also mean being a literal husband — a good partner, worthy of another person’s love — as he and Carol start to work together archiving books, to save Hocking’s fallow library. (They improve and modernize the archive, too, moving excluded female thinkers from the attic to the heart of the collection.)
books/review,“For someone like me, brought up on the philosophical ideal of rugged individualism,” Kaag writes, this turn to an ethic of love and couples isn’t easy. It does bear surprising intellectual fruit. (True happiness, too — but I won’t ruin the ending.) By gently probing philosophers’ biographies for love affairs, Kaag gives a surprising perspective on their familiar writings. Once he unfolds William James’s chaste love at 54 for a 24-year-old Pauline Goldmark, you must hear a different resonance in dry lines Kaag quotes from James’s great essay “The Will to Believe” on the tie of will to results — when James asks: “Do you like me or not? . . . The previous faith on my part in your liking’s existence is in such cases what makes your liking come.” And after Kaag’s elegant portrait of the marriage of William Ernest Hocking and his wife Agnes, then Hocking’s bereavement of her, then his new love at age 87 with the 68-year-old Nobel Prize-winning novelist Pearl Buck, Kaag teaches us to hear the philosopher’s lines about “communion with others” with the ears of love: “How would it seem if my mind could but once be within thine; and we could meet and without barrier be with each other?”
books/review,In its celebration of romantic love (in an egalitarian, improved family) as the apex of American philosophical commitments, Kaag’s book is extremely contemporary. It does somewhat evade how the key philosophers it addresses — Emerson, James, Royce, Hocking — sought their solitude or love in further relations to the supernatural, God or some godhead, and moved from immanence to transcendence, not the other way around. Kaag doesn’t hide this, and anyway, how would or could he champion family love today in other than a this-worldly frame? Yet the weight of transcendent meaning and mysticism which gets transferred from divinity to companionate marriage here (as everywhere else in our world) seems a cruelly heavy burden upon intimate life. Perhaps it’s just a first step. “American Philosophy” succeeds, not as a textbook or survey, but a spirited lover’s quarrel with the individualism and solipsism in our national thought.
us,Gay Couples Wed After Same-Sex Marriage Decision - The New York Times Shortly after the Supreme Court decision to let stand appeals court rulings allowing same-sex unions was announced, Attorney General Mark Herring of Virginia moved quickly to allow gay marriages to take place in the state. The scene in Richmond, Va., on Monday. The couple was married shortly after 1 p.m., Kristin Smith reported for WRIC-TV. Kaila DeRienzo, reporting for WVEC-TV, tweeted about the first same-sex couple to wed in Virginia Beach. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia praised the decision. Utah forged ahead on issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Monday, despite disappointment from Gov. Gary R. Herbert over the court’s decision. Mr. Herbert announced in January that the state would not recognize same-sex marriage while it pressed its legal efforts to limit marriages to one man and one woman. Sharon Baldwin and Mary Bishop were among the first to marry at the Tulsa County Courthouse in Oklahoma on Monday afternoon. They were plaintiffs in a federal court case that challenged the state’s ban on same-sex marriage.
magazine,There’s Only Love and Fear: On Cher’s Twitter - The New York Times Welcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social media presences of celebrities.  No one would blame you if you dismissed Cher’s Twitter feed as the unhinged ramblings of an out-of-touch celebrity, someone desperately in need of intervention by a publicist or a sympathetic assistant. To the casual observer, Cher’s tweets are barely decipherable. She pays little to no attention to rules of grammar, like punctuation or sentence structure, and she capitalizes many words individually, causing her messages to read like bad novelty T-shirts or mock propaganda posters. She frequently — and comically — tacks on extra signoffs at the end of her tweets (“I was looking at tweets & saw that i really hurt someones feelings ! Im sorry. It was light blue background with white egg shape . Bye” ). She loves to load her tweets with emojis — her favorites include the birthday cake, sweat droplets, prayer hands and the American flag — even if they aren’t related to the subject matter of her message. It’s a type of unmoored candor that we typically associate with celebrities who are on the verge of a downward spiral. But that doesn’t appear to be the case for Cher.
magazine,Sometimes Cher herself seems mystified by her cryptic missives. Take, for example, a recent post in which she posted a gorgeous, lavender-washed photograph of her younger self, midsway on the dance floor, alongside the inexplicably confusing caption: “Girls just want to have Fun … Was a crazy day … wanted to post this in a.m … But Don’t think I Did,” followed by several emojis, including the ghost and the “tears of joy” smiley face. The day after Christmas, she wrote, “Adults are SO PACMAN,” and a few weeks before that, she posted a message that simply said: “We Should B Vigilant, Aware Of Our Surroundings‼️ Something‼️Say Something‼️ONE BIG CATCH,WE ALL HAVE OUR GLUDED 2 OUR PHONES‼️WENOTHING.” A decent number of her tweets seem as if they might have been cut-and-pasted into the wrong bubble on her iPad, as if they were meant for a private interaction, rather than for consumption by the 2.7 million people who follow her: “Ask Andy, what he wants me to do.” On another occasion, without any context or explanation, she fired off a tweet that said, “Stanley Tucci is a Brat.” But if you follow her feed long enough, a logical, or at least intelligible, character begins to emerge from the chaos. Cher seems healthy and happy, proud of her two adorable boy kittens and hard at work on a line of branded swag that includes coffee mugs and T-shirts. She affectionately refers to her followers as chickadees, using the baby-chicken emoji combined with the letters “adees” to get her point across. She’s an outspoken critic of Donald Trump and an activist. In mid-January, she donated cases of water to Flint, Mich., in the wake of the news that the town’s supply was contaminated with lead, and encouraged other celebrities to do the same.
magazine,Eventually, you realize that Cher uses Twitter in its purest and most organic form: a catchall for any and every thought that might drift into her brain. Her methodology is messy and strange in a way that feels borderline extinct at a time when celebrities and aspiring celebrities treat their social-media presence as endless personal infomercials, vehicles for inciting envy and lust as a means of increasing visibility, and in turn, popularity. Most celebrities’ social-media feeds feel painfully self-aware and thirsty — revealing their desperate desire to seem relevant, in on the joke, caught up on the latest Internet memes and trends. (A classic example: When Katy Perry invoked Pepe, a creepy cartoon frog favored by 4chan users, to describe her jet lag last year, some Internet users complained that the meme had become too mainstream.) In her own way, Cher is an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit and yell (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and be rewarded for it. Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths. Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye. Software edits out acne, brightens our complexions and generally buffs away most of the unintentional sloppiness from our photos, while auto-correct keeps us from betraying what information we don’t know — in turn, erasing much of the humanity from the versions of ourselves that we publish online. One oddity of Cher’s hyperhuman approach to Twitter is that, in its nonsensicality, it resembles the feed of an automated spambot, causing Cher — of all people — to reveal how stiff and mechanical most humans have evolved into portraying themselves online.
magazine,I love Cher’s Twitter because I have difficulty achieving perfection online. I often omit key words from tweets and captions without ever noticing it, use hyphens incorrectly, deploy improper spacing and forget to fix typos before publishing to my personal feeds. I wish I could say that my approach comes from an unbridled sense of irreverence and creativity, as Cher’s does, but it’s closer to a more prosaic carelessness. But perhaps I can learn a lesson from Cher — to not be afraid to let the world know that it is actually me tweeting, not a social-media intern or a younger, savvier relative. Perhaps I, like Cher, will reach my true potential when I stop trying to be “good” at Twitter and just let my natural self flow.

us,‘Black Lives Matter’ Protesters Gather; Mall Is Shut in Response - The New York Times BLOOMINGTON, Minn. —  They marched into the country’s largest mall, hoping to draw attention to a killing last month of an unarmed black man by the police in North Minneapolis. Instead, protesters were met on Wednesday by about 200 police officers, including at least 50 in riot gear, who ushered them out of the rotunda of the Mall of America as the police tried to prevent a repeat of a disruption there a year ago. A siren sounded and a recording announced the mall’s closing, telling shoppers to “seek shelter.” Dozens of Black Lives Matter protesters then rode the light rail to the nearby airport, where officials said they blocked access to one of two terminals, causing several delayed flights and significant traffic backups on nearby roads. Hundreds of others remained outside the mall’s blocked entrance, chanting in the snow. A spokesman for the Bloomington police said four protesters were arrested at the mall: three for trespassing, one for trespassing and disorderly conduct. The protests came amid national scrutiny of the treatment of African-Americans by the police. Activists here have protested the fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, 24, by an officer after a Nov. 15 scuffle in North Minneapolis. Justin Do closed his nail salon for an hour during the protest and was concerned about the lost business. As a Vietnamese immigrant, Mr. Do said he supported the cause of racial equality and worried about police brutality, but he disagreed with the approach of the activists. “What they’re doing is making it worse,” he said.
us,Disrupting the mall on one of its busiest days is what it takes to get attention and effect change, said one protester, Jason Sole, an adjunct professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul. “When you’re thinking about tearing down white supremacy, you got to go to the places that’ll be hurt or crippled by a loss of funds.” On Tuesday, mall officials went to court to bar the rally, but the judge said she did not have the power to block unidentified protesters from showing up. The judge did bar three organizers from attending. Danny Givens, a nondenominational pastor from St. Paul, said he saw a parallel between the nascent movement and the biblical Christmas narrative. “I believe Black Lives Matter returning to the Mall of America as similar to the pursuit of justice with the Virgin Mary and Joseph, looking for a place to give birth to their baby — Black Lives Matter hearing there’s no room here for us to give birth to justice and liberation. There’s never been any room.” The mall’s lawyer, Susan Gaertner, said the mall was not singling out the group. “You have to ask, ‘Would you want us to permit a demonstration by white supremacists?’ Of course not. The Mall of America is consistent: no demonstrations, no matter how righteous the cause.” Ms. Gaertner spoke of restaurant workers who rely on tips from peak holiday traffic and an eighth-grade choir that canceled its planned performance at the mall. “That may not seem like a big deal to a protester,” she said, “but it was a big deal to that eighth grader.”
science,Steps to Limit Global-Warming Gas - The New York Times Capturing and storing the carbon dioxide generated by power plants and factories could play an important role in limiting global warming caused by humans, says an international climate research group associated with the United Nations. In a new report the group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says doing so could cut the cost of stabilizing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere as much as 30 percent compared with other options, like switching to cleaner technologies. Altogether, sequestering carbon dioxide could eventually account for slightly more than half of what is needed to prevent dangerous concentrations in the atmosphere, says the report, which was released on Monday and is online at www.ipcc.ch. But the report cautions that while the method is cheaper than others, it would significantly raise the cost of electricity for many years. For that reason, several authors and United Nations officials said, it is unlikely that the technique will be adopted voluntarily by industries in wealthy countries. "First there has to be a policy in place to provide the incentive" to adopt such technologies, said Bert Metz, a Dutch environmental official who was the lead author of the report. Carbon dioxide is the main heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe emission linked by scientists to a prolonged global warming trend. The report says the most promising methods for capturing and storing the gas are those already in use in Canada, Norway and Algeria, where some industries inject it into wells.
science,But many power plants are not situated over rock layers that can serve as a long-term repository for the gas. In such instances, the carbon dioxide would have to be piped or transported, raising the cost. The report also said there were many unanswered questions about how much gas might be stored. "A lot of people, including myself, would like to think you can do everything with renewables and energy efficiency, with photovoltaic panels and wind turbines and more sensible urban planning and so on," said one author, Kenneth Caldeira, a staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University. "The reality of it is that the energy in fossil fuels is too attractive and cheap right now to give them up completely."
world/europe,Belgian Liberal Basks in Viral Fame for Scolding Greek Prime Minister - The New York Times While the Greek debt crisis remains unresolved, and the country’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, finds himself derided by even members of his own party, at least one European politician clearly seems to be enjoying himself. Guy Verhofstadt, a former prime minister of Belgium who now leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a free-market group in the European Parliament, achieved a measure of viral fame this week, as video of him scolding Mr. Tsipras during a discussion of the crisis on Wednesday was viewed over seven million times on Facebook and YouTube. As the political press in Brussels took notice, Mr. Verhofstadt seemed to suggest that his angry, sarcastic lecture on the floor of the European Parliament had played some role in Greece’s decision to submit a proposal very like the one voters roundly rejected at the start of the week. Although Mr. Tsipras was even-keeled in his response, and the exchange was not quite as testy as those seen in, say, the British House of Commons most weeks, the intensity of the Belgian’s disgust for his Greek colleague revealed a partisan aspect to the debate over fiscal policy that is often overlooked. While it might be no surprise that a supporter of free-market ideologies like Mr. Verhofstadt — who endorsed a centrist party before the last election in Greece — had such a clash with Mr. Tsipras, who leads a “coalition of the radical left,” the Greek leader has found scant support from any of Europe’s larger center-left parties.
world/europe,As the Slovene philosopher Slavoj Zizek argued in The New Statesman this week, while Mr. Tsipras and his Syriza Party are often described in ideological terms as far left, the political orientation of the parties representing Greece’s creditors matters, too, but is less frequently mentioned. Mr. Zizek suggested that this could be seen most clearly in the tension between Greek negotiators and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who speaks in the language of an impartial expert but also represents one of Greece’s major creditors: Mr. Dijsselbloem has become such a hate figure in Greece that his shocked face was featured on the front page of a Greek newspaper as if reacting to the results of the referendum rejecting the deal he reportedly described as “a take it or leave it offer.” In purely personal terms, it might be unsurprising that the Dutch finance minister showed so little sympathy for Greece at the 11th hour, given that his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, publicly undermined his authority after their first meeting five months ago. (Video of that awkward encounter inspired meme after meme on YouTube.) But Pepijn Brandon, a Dutch historian at the University of Pittsburgh, suggested in February on the website Jacobin that social democrats who have embraced centrist fiscal policies, like Mr. Dijsselbloem, were deeply threatened by Mr. Tsipras and his party. “The promise of the Syriza government represents everything that postwar social democracy no longer is, and cannot return to,” Mr. Brandon wrote. “Underlying Dijsselbloem’s career is the perspective that at best, contemporary progressive politics can only be a variant of conservative politics with slightly more scruples.”
world/europe,For that reason, the historian suggested, Mr. Dijsselbloem had an interest in curbing the ambitions of the new Greek government. “It is a precondition for restoring the stability of the EU that he, his party, and economic elites so desire,” Mr. Brandon argued. “But it is as necessary for the continuation of the dreamless, managerial, suit-and-tie progressivism from which he has never strayed.”
science,A Tentacled, Flexible Breakthrough - The New York Times LIVORNO, Italy —  For years, roboticists have yearned to develop a flexible machine that can explore tight spaces, repair dangerous equipment and potentially even conform to the human body. Now one of the first members of this new breed of robots is almost here. It has sinewy arms, a powerful grip and the ability to work underwater without coming up for air. Yes, it is an octopus. Because octopuses can swim, crawl and manipulate objects, they make “the ideal underwater robot,” said Francesco Giorgio-Serchi, a scientist at the Research Center on Sea Technologies and Marine Robotics here, who is working on the project. In a small seaside laboratory, he and others have been tinkering away on a prototype of a multiarmed robot they call PoseiDrone for the sea god Poseidon. Pieces of half-built arms are scattered about, and an inflatable kiddie pool sits between tables. It was in that modest body of water that their robotic octopus got its sea legs, as it were. It did so well in the pool that the researchers borrowed a small boat and deployed it in the Ligurian Sea, still attached to their controls via cables. It successfully swam in the waves and adeptly crawled along the rocky bottom. Robotic technology is generally based on hard materials — a logical approach, because they can be controlled with precise movements and low computing power. Soft robotics is something else altogether, promising “the mechanical versatility you find in natural organisms,” said Carmel Majidi, a mechanical engineer at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute who is working to develop sensitive artificial skin and strong artificial muscles.
science,Imagine a roving vacuum cleaner that could literally squeeze itself into nooks where dust bunnies hide. Or more grandly, Dr. Majidi said, exploration vehicles, construction drones, “wearable robots and maybe even implantable robots.” Early efforts in the field date to the 1940s, when scientists developed pneumatic “artificial muscles” to be used in traditional robots. Progress has inched along since then, producing small-scale projects like scooting soft-bodied caterpillars and pneumatic quadrupeds. But the advent of 3D printing has greatly accelerated the chase. Dr. Majidi said the technology had been “a bit of a game-changer,” enabling just about any research team — or garage tinkerer — to make new molds to create stretchy prototypes, a process that just a few years ago was slow and costly. A group at Harvard used molds from a 3D printer to create a prototype of a soft, octopuslike four-legged robot that could be controlled via tubes of liquid or air. And here in Italy, Dr. Giorgio-Serchi and his colleagues recently acquired a 3D printer that allows them to design, experiment and revise quickly. They aim to replicate the key features of an octopus: eight arms to provide an almost infinite range of motion; the ability to squeeze through any opening larger than its chitinous beak; and an unusual nervous system in which the arms are semiautonomous and the central brain is thought to do little more than issue general commands (“Arms, let’s go catch that crab!”).
science,To make quicker headway, some of the PoseiDrone’s components, such as the electronics, remain hard for now. The exterior will be silicone — a material whose density, like that of an octopus, is similar to water’s. The drone’s potential missions include inspecting and repairing underwater turbines, wave-energy generators, oil rigs, ship hulls and perhaps fishing nets. In contrast to a hard-bodied underwater bot, which would need to hover at a safe distance from such equipment, the PoseiDrone should be able to attach itself directly without damaging the equipment or itself, Dr. Giorgio-Serchi said. Sending robots down to perform dangerous tasks could also help keep human divers safer. The drone can already crawl, swim and even carry small tools. But it is not yet ready to repair a turbine. And although the researchers are applying for patents, it is still a crude specimen, a robotic Frankenstein’s monster bridging the eras of hard and squishy — currently only 80 percent soft materials. “It’s still very much a work in progress,” Dr. Majidi said. And Mark R. Cutkosky, a professor at the Stanford School of Engineering, said: “How do we build stretchy conductors? That’s still a very open question.” “It sounds pretty prosaic,” he added, “yet one of the biggest challenges is just wiring. This was true 20 years ago, and it’s still true.” The PoseiDrone’s movements still rely on external control of conventional motors and actuators.
science,Nevertheless, the octopus robot is more sophisticated than a standard robot covered in rubber, Dr. Giorgio-Serchi said. Its abundance of soft, elastic materials enables it to do things most other robots cannot — much as stiff-jointed humans cannot do what an octopus can, despite our soft skin and muscles. “Without the soft part,” Dr. Giorgio-Serchi said, “it would just be a pile of motors and cables.” Also like real cephalopods, the PoseiDrone, whose body is about the length of an adult human hand, could be just about any scale — from fractions of an inch to dozens of feet across. A larger version is in the works. And perhaps not reassuring  to those who fear a robot uprising, the bigger it is, “the easier it is to make it stronger — and fast,” Dr. Giorgio-Serchi said. Virtually any conceivable form is now just a click away, so why do researchers focus on animal models? Dr. Cutkosky, who has built a climbing robot with gecko-inspired grippers, says we inevitably look to the natural world for inspiration. And caution. Comparing the octopus robot to its real-life counterpart, he said, “It’s probably a good thing they’re confined to water.”
science,Miles of Algae and a Multitude of Hazards - The New York Times The stench of decaying algae began rising from coastal waterways in southeastern Florida early this month, shutting down businesses and beaches during a critical tourism season. Officials arrived, surveyed the toxic muck and declared states of emergency in four counties. Residents shook their heads, then their fists, organizing rallies and haranguing local officials. In truth, there was little they could do: The disaster that engulfed the St. Lucie River and its estuary had been building for weeks. In May, a 33-square-mile algal bloom crept over Lake Okeechobee, the vast headwaters of the Everglades. After an unseasonably wet winter, the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to discharge water from the lake to lower water levels, flushing the ooze along channels to the east and west until it coagulated along the shores of the famed Treasure Coast. The mess in Florida is only the latest in a string of algal blooms that some experts believe are increasing in frequency and in severity. An immense plume of blue-green algae last September covered a 636-mile stretch of the Ohio River. A month earlier, the city of Toledo, Ohio, warned more than 400,000 residents to avoid drinking tap water after toxic algae spread over an intake in Lake Erie. (Indeed, the Lake Erie bloom is now an annual event.) Almost exactly a year before the Florida bloom, another stretching 7,500 square miles washed ashore in Qingdao, China, a popular beach destination. Government officials called in hundreds of boats and bulldozers to remove it. The green blob appeared again earlier this month.
science,The largest and most dangerous algal bloom ever recorded, which ranged from Central California to British Columbia, produced high levels of a toxin that last year closed crab and clam fisheries along the West Coast. “The season didn’t open for four and a half months, which meant slip rents went unpaid, house payments went unpaid, guys were having trouble getting groceries to feed their families,” said Tim Sloane, the executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations. Algae is a catchall term referring to a wide variety of aquatic organisms that generally rely on photosynthesis for energy and reproduction. Blue-green algae are cyanobacteria, for instance, while red tide is composed of tiny dinoflagellates. Seaweed is a sophisticated alga, as is kelp. Blooms are a natural occurrence. According to Dr. William Cochlan, a senior research scientist at San Francisco State University, Native Americans for centuries knew to avoid bioluminescent water. Scientists would later discover that the glow was caused by dinoflagellates that also produce a hazardous neurotoxin. Many algal species produce similar toxins. When vast blooms occur, these poisons may spread through the environment and up the food chain to fish and animals that feed on them. Cyanobacteria produce microcystins, for example, which can affect the liver and can be deadly to humans — one reason Toledo banned the drinking water. Although they occur naturally, algal blooms are being intensified by human activity in ways that scientists are still trying to quantify. Chief among the culprits: runoff from farms, feedlots and municipal sewer systems.
science,“The bloom itself is the visual manifestation of nutrient overenrichment in lakes,” said Tim Davis, an ecologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. “In freshwater systems, both nitrogen and phosphorus are the main nutrients.” In Florida and the Great Lakes, nitrogen and phosphorus come mainly from fertilizers used in large farming operations, along with septic tanks, manure and storm water. Scientists have been aware of the nutrient problem for decades: It’s partly why phosphorus was removed from laundry detergents. The vast algal bloom in the Pacific last year was also fed in part by El Niño, the mass of warm water that forms periodically off the West Coast. But longer-term climate change may also be playing a role, some experts say. Warming atmospheric temperatures and wetter weather in some parts of the country increase the nutrient-laden runoff into streams, lakes and the ocean. And as ice melts in the Arctic, sea temperatures are rising and more sunlight is filtering into the ocean. “Some of the features of climate change, such as warmer ocean temperatures and increased light availability through the loss of sea ice in the Arctic, are making conditions more favorable for phytoplankton growth — both toxic and nontoxic algae — in more regions and farther north,” Kathi Lefebvre, a biologist at NOAA’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, wrote in an email. “It is likely that toxic blooms will continue to increase and expand as these features of climate change continue,” she added.
science,Dr. Davis said he also believed that climate change was working against efforts to prevent algal blooms. “I certainly believe as a scientist that climate change will influence the size and intensity of these blooms,” he said. “If nothing changes — the increase of rainfall, the increase nutrient loads, warmer water — all of this could lead to larger blooms that last longer and are more toxic.” Florida’s crisis is only the most recent example, Dr. Cochlan of San Francisco State University said — yet no new funds have been appropriated at the federal or state levels to study the growth and toxicity in these blooms, despite their increasing impact throughout the country. In a letter to President Obama on July 12, Florida legislators asked for federal funding to avert further disaster. Back in 2014, Florida voters approved Amendment 1, setting aside an estimated $650 million in the program’s first year for the state to buy agricultural land south of Lake Okeechobee as a new pathway for discharge into the Everglades. The hope was that the ecosystem would provide a natural filter for algae and other contaminants, as it once did. But in the end, the state decided not to buy the land, instead sparring with Environmental Protection Agency over its efforts to enforce the federal Clean Water Act. “A lot of this has to do with legislation, all the way from the watershed down into the lake,” Dr. Davis said. “It needs to be a mutual effort on all sides. The more we understand about the blooms, the more we can do to reduce their impact.”
upshot,‘Think They Got Killed?’ 1964, L.B.J. and Three Civil Rights Icons - The New York Times Fifty years ago this week, three young civil rights activists — Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman — vanished in Neshoba County, Miss. That same week, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed the Senate and was on its way to President Lyndon Johnson for his signature. Mississippi had been seething with death threats against young men and women who had come to register African-American voters in what they called “Freedom Summer.” Goodman and Schwerner were white New Yorkers, Chaney a black Mississippian. Thanks to Johnson’s secret taping system, we can go back to that moment and hear the president and those around him reacting to the terrible news. “What do you think happened?” L.B.J. asks his assistant legal counsel, Lee White. “Think they got killed?” White replies: “This morning they had absolutely no trace. As far as they’re concerned, they just disappeared from the face of the earth.” Johnson recalls that in preparation for Freedom Summer, he had asked J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, “to fill up Mississippi with F.B.I. men and infiltrate” the Ku Klux Klan and other militant segregationist groups — “that they haul them in by the dozens.” “The only weapon I have for locating them is the F.B.I.,” he says. “I can’t find them myself.”
upshot,He scoffs at the suggestion by his growing political rival, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, that the president visit with the missing young men’s parents. “I’m afraid that if I start housemothering each kid that’s gone down there and that doesn’t show up, that we’ll have this White House full of people every day, asking for sympathy,” he tells Kennedy’s deputy, Nicholas Katzenbach. “And congressmen too, because they want to come over and have their picture made and get on TV.” Asked what he thinks befell the young men, Katzenbach says they probably “got picked up by some of these Klan people.” Johnson asks, “And murdered?” “Or else they’re just being hidden in one of those barns,” Katzenbach says. “And having the hell scared out of them.” When L.B.J. calls Senator James Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat and a well-known segregationist, Eastland makes it clear he is anything but sympathetic to the young men’s plight. “I don’t believe there’s three missing,” he sputters. “I believe it’s a publicity stunt.” Then Hoover calls the president to report that the F.B.I. has found the Ford station wagon that the three had been riding in. “The car was burned,” he says, “and we do not know yet whether any bodies are inside of the car because of the intense heat that still is in the area of the car. “Apparently what’s happened — these men have been killed. … This is merely an assumption — that probably they were burned in the car. On the other hand, they may have been taken out and killed on the outside.”
upshot,“Or maybe kidnapped and locked up,” Johnson says. Ruefully, Hoover says, “I would doubt whether those people down there would give them even that much of a break.” Soon the president realizes he must see the young men’s relatives, but wants it done quietly. “Tell them to just come down to your office, and come in that side door,” he instructs Lee White. “Tell them what-all we’ve done, and let me come over and say a word. And I just ought to tell them we’ve found the car.” White says, “That’s going to be rough.” When Goodman’s parents and Schwerner’s father entered the Oval Office, Goodman’s mother, Carolyn, heard L.B.J. talking to Hoover about finding the car. She later recalled, “I wanted to leap toward his desk and shout: ‘Tell me quickly. Are they all right?' ” Johnson took her hand and described the flaming wreck, saying, “Ma’am, we’ll do everything we can.” But on Aug. 4, 1964, the remains of the three brave men were discovered under an earthen dam near Philadelphia, Miss. Chaney had been shot three times and bludgeoned, the other two shot through the heart. Twenty-one Ku Klux Klansmen and local law enforcement officials were accused by the F.B.I. in the case, but the Mississippi authorities would not prosecute for murder. Instead, the federal government was reduced to prosecuting 18 for denying the three victims their civil rights; seven were found guilty, and each served less than six years.
upshot,Edgar Ray Killen, a Klansman accused of supervising the murders, stayed free until 2005, when, at the age of 80, he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison.
world/asia,As Cancer Rates Rise in China, Trust Remains Low - The New York Times BEIJING — Living in China these days, we’re bombarded with scary accounts of rising cancer rates that are partly linked to some of the world’s worst pollution. The slogan this year for National Cancer Prevention and Care Week, which began Tuesday, spells it out: “Protect the Environment, Keep Cancer Away.” That even the Chinese state is highlighting a link between the poor environment and cancer reflects an atmosphere of deep concern, verging on panic, over public health, as more and more people ask: Is China killing itself in the pursuit of spectacularly fast, very dirty, economic growth? Of course, there are other, important reasons for rising rates, like an aging population and changing diet and lifestyles, as the Shanghai cancer specialists Guo Xiaomao and Long Jiang recently wrote in The Xinmin Evening News. And China’s cancer rate is still below that of the United States. About 3.5 million people are diagnosed with cancer yearly, the Zhejiang Science and Technology News Net reported Tuesday, citing a 2012 report by the National Cancer Registry. (Other news accounts put the figure at 3.12 million. Statistics in China often vary.) In the United States, with a population less than a quarter of China’s 1.35 billion, more than 1.6 million people are expected to receive a diagnosis of cancer in 2013, according to the American Cancer Society.
world/asia,But cancer rates in the United States are falling, whereas in China they are rising, doctors and officials say. And China’s death rate from cancer is far higher — about 2.5 million people yearly, compared with the 580,350 expected to die in the United States this year. Complicating things further, some doctors are wondering: Is China facing a double health whammy as rising disease rates challenge a troubled medical system? At the top of the list of reasons China may be facing a cancer crisis is the crucial issue of mistrust between patient and doctor. A new article in the Journal of Oncology Practice, published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, illustrates this problem. The lack of trust, reflected in regular accounts in the Chinese news media of patients and their families venting anger or even physically attacking physicians, is rooted in a perception that doctors are out for personal gain and may be incompetent or corrupt. But according to the article — written by two oncologists, Dr. David H. Garfield of the United States and Dr. Harold Brenner of Israel, and a Chinese oncology nurse, Lucy Lu (who in 2011 were in a group that set up the first of several planned outpatient cancer centers in China, the article said) — doctors are afraid of being blamed by hospital administrators for “bad outcomes,” or deaths, and may act in ways that may protect themselves but may not be in the patient’s best interests.
world/asia,In “Practicing Western Oncology in Shanghai, China: One Group’s Experience,” Ms. Lu wrote: “We are attempting to serve a huge population with limited resources, and the system to protect Chinese physicians remains a big issue. If there are bad results, the physicians are guilty unless they can prove themselves to be right.” Curiously, for a one-party state obsessed with control, in medical treatment “There is no culture of ‘the captain of the ship,”’ they wrote. “Thus, we cannot control what other treatments patients are simultaneously receiving.” Ms. Lu says in the article: “Our Western physicians take difficult cases as challenges, whereas Chinese physicians first assess risk to themselves and hesitate in helping patients.” All too often, the human touch is lacking. “Hospitals are reluctant to have patients die on their premises. Lack of hospices for dying patients” is a problem, the authors wrote. The article is spreading fast among Chinese oncologists, some of whom are dedicated practitioners. They say its criticisms are broadly accurate. Their recognition of the problem is attended by mixed feelings of regret, “for the patients, for the physicians, for the government,” as one doctor said. (The doctors asked not to be identified because they work in the military medical system, which forbids interviews with the news media.) The article’s conclusion is being especially hotly discussed — and acknowledged — by Chinese doctors. Ms. Lu’s summary says: “The speed of advancement of the whole country is so fast that we may have missed something that is important, and we need to think about it. We need to learn more from the West than just importing these fabulous machines.”
world/asia,The Western doctors called their time in Shanghai “a challenging experience,” explaining that “Respect for and knowledge of Chinese culture and an attempt, as difficult at that may be, not to be judgmental are required.” There’s that. Then there’s this: As news accounts, often backed by official reports, multiply of cancer villages, of rivers and wells running milky — or orange, or red, or black — with pollution, of rising cancer rates among young people as well as old, the Chinese doctors’ reactions are the most telling: They care deeply about their patients and they love their country, they say. Yet they know there are serious questions as to whether the system allows best practice. And they don’t see easy solutions.
world/middleeast,Statue Being Pulled From a Gritty Patch of Cairo Could Be of Ramses - The New York Times CAIRO — The gritty, working-class neighborhood of Matariya in northeast Cairo brims with noise and poverty, a place where motorized rickshaws vie with donkey carts on narrow, trash-strewn streets. But this week, archaeologists began pulling from a patch of barren ground a glistening 26-foot statue they say might be a world-class find. If they are especially lucky, the colossus will be determined to be a likeness of Pharaoh Ramses II, one of the most famous rulers of ancient Egypt. That mystery will not be solved until next week, when they hope to finish the excavation and can look for any inscriptions on the quartzite statue. Yet, for now, they are excited by the discovery itself, saying the statue is at least 3,000 years old, just the type of artifact they hoped to recover before further building in the teeming neighborhood makes such treasures impossible to find. “This was a great surprise,” said Dietrich Raue, a director of a team of German and Egyptian archaeologists who have been excavating a vast temple complex at the site since 2012. “We had to clear the area before any future construction work and because the monuments are below the level of the groundwater. The quality of the stone is fantastic, and it has an amazing art historical value.”
world/middleeast,The first sign of the colossus came on Tuesday when excavation workers uncovered the lower part of the statue’s chin. On Thursday, archaeologists and residents watched as a hydraulic excavator lifted the statue’s broken crown, glistening with water and mud, from the ground. Later, smiling children posed for photographs as they leaned against the fragment. The team also found part of a life-size limestone statue of Seti II, another pharaoh and a grandson of Ramses II. Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry hailed that as an important find as well, although it was not the first in Matariya, which was built on land that was once Heliopolis, an ancient city near the Nile. More than 150 people are working on the current dig — most of them Egyptian archaeologists and workers, along with a small number of German academics and European specialists. The archaeologists are rushing to uncover as much as they can of the temple complex before local construction projects, some illegal, cover the land. Houses and building sites border the excavation zone, and sometimes during the dig, workers have had to clear trash and animal carcasses, according to Salima Ikram, an Egyptian member of the team. Once new buildings go up, further excavation will become impossible. “It’s a race against time,” she said. Establishing the identity of the colossus is complicated because it has been broken into pieces and only fragments of the face have been found. Dr. Raue said it might have been destroyed by early Christians, or by the Muslim rulers of Cairo in the 11th century as they used limestone stonework from ancient temples to build the city’s fortifications.
world/middleeast,But statues like the colossus were cast aside because they were made from quartzite. Ramses II was a formidable figure, not only in Egypt but across much of the ancient world. During his reign, from 1279 to 1213 B.C., he expanded his empire east to present-day Syria and south into Sudan. He was also known for monumental building projects, including sprawling sun temples filled with statues of himself, one of which was discovered under a Cairo marketplace in 2006. The discovery of the buried colossus may also have strong literary echoes. A shattered statue of Ramses II was the subject of Ozymandias, a celebrated poem by the 19th-century English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. (Ozymandias was the name of Ramses II in ancient Greek.) The poem speaks of the discovery of a broken statue in the desert bearing the inscription, “My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” — an image sometimes used to symbolize human mortality and the impermanence of empire. Shelley began writing the poem in 1817, soon after the British Museum announced that it had acquired a fragment of another statue of Ramses II that had been taken from an ancient temple at Thebes, in modern-day Luxor, by an Italian adventurer. On Monday, archaeologists will look for an inscription on the back pillar of the latest find, to see if it is indeed Ramses II.
world/middleeast,It could provide some badly needed good news for Egypt’s embattled tourism industry, which has been in a crippling decline since the 2011 uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. Visitors to Egypt dropped to 5.4 million in 2016 from 14.7 million in 2010, although there has been a small upswing in recent months. If the colossus is confirmed to be Ramses II, experts say they will piece it together and move it to the entrance of the Grand Egyptian Museum, the world’s largest archaeological museum currently under construction near the pyramids of Giza and set to open next year.
movies,The Oscars and Race: A Stir Over Rules to Change the Academy - The New York Times When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled 20 all-white acting nominees this month, the furor was immediate. The #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, created last year, returned in force, and there was talk of an Oscar boycott. Then, last week, the academy declared that it was doubling its diversity push and ending guaranteed lifelong voting rights. This time, it was academy members’ turn to react in disbelief and outrage. The most common cri de coeur: The changes were ageist (a possibility) and insulting to blacks (if there’s a black academy member out there who agrees, please do get in touch). Another: “I’m liberal, so I can’t be racist,” a tautological cry that largely misses the point. For what it’s worth, Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith did not utter the dreaded r-word when they announced they were not attending the awards; Ms. Smith wished the academy “grace and love.” There is, among older academy members, genuine bewilderment in the wake of this tidal shift. Sidney Furie, an 82-year-old member, noted that it was his brethren who made Sidney Poitier the first black man to win best actor, in 1963, and named “In the Heat of the Night” (1967) best picture. “The very people who voted for those Oscars are now being accused of being the roadblocks to the diversity the academy now seems committed to,” Mr. Furie wrote to the Bagger in an email. Valid, but part of the charge against the academy is how out of touch it is with contemporary black culture.
movies,What many academy members — who, as a Los Angeles Times investigation found, skew heavily older, male and white — do not seem to fully grasp is the deep exasperation around the fact that white dudes continue to serve as Hollywood’s gatekeepers. At last count, about 2 percent of academy members were black, and an even lower percentage were Latinos. The (mostly male) members who publicly assailed the academy’s changes ended up underscoring the crux of the problem by making the issue, yet again, all about them. “White guys, we’ve run the show the last 10,000 years, and in this country, 250 years,” Michael Moore told the Bagger a few days ago. “You get used to talking loud and calling the shots in the room, so that others can’t be heard.” What we’re hearing now, Mr. Moore said, is “that dying dinosaur noise.” Perhaps the reason #OscarsSoWhite found such traction this year — after years of critics and audiences lamenting the paucity of good roles for black, Asian and Latino actors — was that the whole world, at last, was really watching, in no small part because of the might of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the spotlighting of police killings of African-Americans. Black lives matter, and so do the ways in which lives are represented on the big and small screens: They inform how we view each other, and ourselves. A few years ago, researchers found correlations between television exposure and self-esteem among black and white girls and boys. Television was linked to lower self-esteem among black and white girls and black boys; white boys, however, reportedly felt better.
movies,It has been noted that the number of black acting nominees in recent decades has mirrored the percentage of blacks in the general population. The same cannot be said for Latinos, who make up a greater proportion of the population, as Rubén Blades recently wrote, or for Asians. But the representational proportionality of black nominees applies only to the acting categories. Let’s look at all of the awards the academy doles out, across all categories, and see how they break down by ethnicity. Let’s look at all the films Hollywood churns out and do the same: Few of the roughly 300 features eligible for best picture last year told stories from the points of view of women or minorities. Besides, we’ve been fed narratives from an overwhelmingly white male perspective since Hollywood began. Isn’t it high time for some alternate narratives, at the very least? Isn’t the purpose of art to jostle, broaden and challenge our worldview? Unanswered is whether the academy’s rule changes and push to diversify can or will affect what films Hollywood makes and rewards. “The academy is going to lead and not wait for the industry to catch up,” Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the organization’s president, said. Yet disgruntled academy members say they are at the end of the sausage-making machine — (ain’t no flies on us!) — and merely adjudicating films already made. In the outcry over the changes, dissenters have largely left alone, at least publicly, the board of governors’ pledge to double the number of female and minority members by 2020.
movies,Most contentious is the academy’s new rule to weed out less active members, an effort that has precedents. In 1970, when Gregory Peck was academy president, several hundred members deemed inactive lost their balloting rights, too. This time, the academy said that to retain the right to vote, a member had to have been active in the last 10 years, or had to have been nominated for an Oscar, or, after becoming a member, had to have worked in motion pictures at least once in three separate 10-year periods. It is fair to surmise this measure will most negatively affect older academy members, especially women. Ageism is rife in Hollywood for both genders. Actresses in particular get fewer movie roles as they grow older, often making the jump to television, if they can, which, in the academy’s eyes, does not count as being active in motion pictures. Many people also only get into the academy when they’re nearing or in middle age, meaning that, barring an Oscar nomination, they need to prove they’re active until their 70s. Mr. Moore, for one, has mixed feelings about this. “We don’t want to lose the experience and the wisdom of the elders,” he said, “The societies that do that end up lesser societies.”
movies,An alternate diversification fix might be to really throw open the academy’s doors. The television academy has more than 20,000 members, compared with the motion picture academy’s estimated 6,200 or so. But in an institution that values its elite status, such a dramatic expansion is unlikely to happen soon, if at all. That plays into what makes being in the academy so important to its members. It’s an honor, a privilege, a validation, and, until now, a secure foothold in a community that becomes ever more important as one’s career fades. Ms. Boone Isaacs has said that those deemed inactive will still be academy members, able to attend screenings and the like, just not allowed to vote. But being able to vote is the raison d’être of academy membership. Mr. Furie likened losing that perk to castration (using a more colorful term). That’s a lot to lose indeed.
us,Two Hurricanes in Two Weeks Bring Two Very Different Reactions - The New York Times WEST KENDALL, Fla. — In the psychology of evacuations, what Hurricane Katrina was to Rita in 2005, so Harvey has been to Irma today. Weeks after Katrina devastated New Orleans in August 2005, Hurricane Rita advanced toward the Texas Gulf Coast that September, alarming officials and residents who had just watched Katrina’s destruction and causing a mass evacuation in the Houston region that led to one of the deadliest traffic jams in Texas history. As Irma headed toward South Florida on Friday, a similar exodus was unfolding in parts of the Miami region, inspired at least in part by Harvey’s devastation nearly two weeks ago, but far smoother than the chaos that occurred on Texas highways in 2005. On Friday, Daniel Marte, 23, said he had watched the scenes of Harvey’s destruction on the news, and that pushed him to evacuate with his roommates from the Homestead area of Miami-Dade County to a shelter set up in a high school in West Kendall. “A lot of people died,” Mr. Marte said of Harvey. “I was worried there’s going to be flooding where I live.” Despite that link between Harvey and Irma, two very different evacuation scenarios have been on display over the last two weeks in two parts of the country – the Houston region as it braced for Hurricane Harvey and the Miami region as Irma prepares to strike.
us,Officials in Houston, led by Mayor Sylvester Turner, declined to issue a mass evacuation order as Harvey approached, but officials in Miami-Dade County have called for the evacuation of more than half a million people. Miami’s two main office and condo districts were ordered to evacuate, part of the biggest evacuation Miami-Dade County officials have ever attempted. Low-lying and coastal areas of other Southern Florida counties also were placed under mandatory evacuation orders. Alan Bernstein, a spokesman for Mr. Turner in Houston, said the mayor’s views on the issue of whether to evacuate Houston “have not changed” in the aftermath of Harvey and in light of the evacuations in South Florida. “Irma is totally different,” Mr. Bernstein said in the statement. “It is forecast for a direct hit on populous areas, bringing highly destructive winds and perhaps heavy coastal destruction. That was not the case here, and Mayor Turner would not second-guess an evacuation order for Florida.” One difference is the geography and size. Harris County, which includes Houston, is the third most-populous county in America, with 4.5 million people. Miami-Dade County has 2.7 million people, and is the country’s seventh biggest. Houston is roughly 50 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, while Miami and its string of islands and keys are at the doorstep of the Atlantic Ocean. Because of that geography, officials in Florida are more battle-tested and prepared for hurricanes than those in Texas. The last time a Category 4 hurricane made landfall in Texas was 1961; the benchmark hurricane experience for many Floridians remains the Category-5 Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
us,The situation was also different in Texas and Florida because of the two hurricanes themselves. Houston officials said Hurricane Harvey was not on course to strike the Houston region with destructive winds and storm surge, but was predicted to drop massive amounts of rain. When it comes to potential flooding from heavy rainfall, so-called sheltering-in-place remains the preferred emergency preparedness model, because it is far more dangerous to venture into floodwaters than to remain at home and call for help. The direct hit from Hurricane Harvey was expected to be, and indeed turned out to be, the Corpus Christi area, roughly 200 miles southwest of Houston. Irma’s threat to the Miami-Dade region was more direct. Irma was forecast for a direct or near-direct hit on the cities and counties in the region, with destructive winds and a powerful tidal surge. The sheltering-in-place model used in Houston would put millions of people in jeopardy if used in the Miami-Dade area. “The danger is being blown away, the danger is being cut in half by flying debris that’s going 175 miles per hour,” said Natalie Simpson, an emergency response expert who is a professor of operations management at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, N.Y. “Flooding is very, very dangerous, but you can scramble for higher ground. It’s not so immediately lethal.”
us,In Houston, one issue that played a background role in the decision to not order an evacuation was the memory of Hurricane Rita in 2005. The highways out of Houston were clogged for hours in that evacuation. Thousands of motorists ran out of gas or slept in their cars, and more than 20 nursing home residents died after they evacuated the Houston area and their bus caught fire on Interstate 45 in a Dallas suburb. That chaotic evacuation in 2005 has led to the perception in the Houston region that any future mass evacuations would be equally problematic. “A mass evacuation order for a county of 4.5 million people would have had to have been planned far ahead and might still have resulted in many deaths, as did the less organized Hurricane Rita evacuation in 2005,” said Mr. Bernstein, the spokesman for the Houston mayor. The messaging of local and state leaders has been another factor in the evacuations, with Florida officials proving more effective than those in Texas. As Harvey advanced on Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said that while local officials are the ones who have the authority to order an evacuation, he seemed to suggest an evacuation of the Houston region was appropriate. “I can be suggestive of what I would do and that is, if I were living in the Houston region, as I once did, I would decide to head to areas north of there,” said Mr. Abbott, a Republican.
us,Houston and Harris County officials reacted swiftly to Mr. Abbott’s comments on social media and at news conferences, urging people to stay home, including Mr. Turner, a Democrat. In Florida, there were no mixed signals. Gov. Rick Scott and local officials throughout the state have been campaigning hard for people to evacuate. “You can find 10 excuses not to go,” said Ken Russell, a Miami city commissioner. “There is no reason not to go. You need to get to a safe location.” Evacuations are complex, amorphous events, and as was clear in South Florida on Friday, mandatory evacuations are often viewed as mere options to some residents. Luis E. Cabrera, the acting chief of the Miami Police Department, said he was concerned that by the middle of Friday afternoon many people had not left the evacuation zones. “A lot of people have left,” he said. “But there are also a lot of people hunkered down to weather the storm.” In Kendall, no evacuation order was in effect, and an upscale senior living home called The Palace Suites was packed with residents and staff. Nathalia Montenegro, 20, will continue to work as a server throughout the weekend there, and her mother will stay with her. She said her mother initially planned to stay at her Miami apartment, but decided to leave the apartment and stay with her farther inland at Palace Suites. “My mom was going to stay, but the flooding in Houston scared her,” Ms. Montenegro said.
movies,‘The Birth of a Nation’ Struggles at the Box Office - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — Any lingering hope that “The Birth of a Nation” could push past a controversy surrounding its star, Nate Parker, to become a financial success and an awards contender appeared to end over the weekend, when it arrived to an estimated $7.1 million in ticket sales — flop territory, especially since the film was backed by an aggressive marketing campaign. “The Birth of a Nation,” which Mr. Parker also directed, wrote and produced, received some stellar reviews but lost momentum as Mr. Parker’s handling of questions on the publicity circuit about his past behavior — he was accused and acquitted of rape in 1999 — triggered a negative reaction toward him and his movie. Over the past week, Mr. Parker generated one damaging headline after another as he appeared on “60 Minutes,” “Good Morning America” and “The Steve Harvey Show” to promote “The Birth of a Nation.” On Friday, The Hollywood Reporter summed it up in blunt terms: “Nate Parker’s Failed Media Tour: Anger, No Remorse and Oprah’s Advice Ignored.” Fox Searchlight, having paid the highest price in its history, $17.5 million, to acquire “The Birth of a Nation,” which dramatizes the 1831 Nat Turner slave revolt, said it was too early to assess the film’s financial picture. “We thought it could be a little higher, but word of mouth is going to be positive, which will allow us to string out to a good result,” said Frank Rodriguez, Searchlight’s head of distribution.
movies,“I’m not going to say we are disappointed,” he added. “The Birth of a Nation,” co-starring Aja Naomi King and Armie Hammer, received an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, Mr. Rodriguez noted. African-Americans made up roughly 60 percent of the opening-weekend audience, he said. To what degree did the toxicity around Mr. Parker dent ticket sales? Mr. Rodriguez said that he was not sure. “It’s a question that we’ve been grappling with,” he said. Hurricane Matthew, which hit Southeastern states over the weekend, appeared to have a limited influence on ticket sales. “The storm didn’t damage it that much,” Mr. Rodriguez said. Given its start, Mr. Parker’s film — even with strong word of mouth — will be lucky to collect a total of $30 million at the domestic box office, analysts said. Under traditional accounting rules, theater owners would keep about half that total. In addition to the acquisition price, Fox Searchlight spent at least $10 million on marketing. “The Birth of a Nation” is not expected to generate much interest overseas. It tells an American story, and its stars are not well known outside of North America. (In contrast, Fox Searchlight’s “12 Years a Slave,” which collected $131 million overseas in 2013, starred the British actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Cumberbatch; featured Brad Pitt; and won best picture at the Oscars.)
movies,In some ways, the poor performance of “The Birth of a Nation,” seen as a corrective to the #OscarsSoWhite maelstrom that consumed Hollywood over the past two years, both opens a corridor for and adds pressure to coming films about African-American experiences. “Fences,” an adaptation of the August Wilson play starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, arrives on Dec. 25. “Moonlight,” a coming-of-age drama centered on a young black man in Miami, has been set for an Oct. 21 release. (Joining “The Birth of a Nation” in failing to find a wide audience: “Queen of Katwe,” a euphorically reviewed and aggressively marketed Disney drama starring Lupita Nyong’o that has taken in only $5.4 million since Sept. 23.) For the weekend, the No. 1 movie at North American theaters was “The Girl on the Train,” which collected about $24.7 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Distributed by Universal and produced by DreamWorks Pictures, a division of Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners, “The Girl on the Train” cost about $45 million to make. Based on the best seller by Paula Hawkins, “The Girl on the Train,” starring Emily Blunt as an alcoholic who becomes wrapped up in a murder, received weak reviews and a B-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls, which could hurt it in the weeks ahead. “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children” (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $15 million, for a two-week domestic total of $51.1 million. Third place went to “Deepwater Horizon” (Lionsgate), with about $11.8 million in ticket sales, for a two-week domestic total of $38.5 million.

t-magazine/travel,An Old Alsatian Museum’s Modern Makeover - The New York Times Every December, the streets of Colmar, one of the prettiest towns in Alsace, are scented by cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg — the aroma of the vin chaud (spiced wine) ladled out to the cheerful crowds who visit its five Christmas markets. Within pine bough-draped chalets, everything from wooden toys and hand-blown glass ornaments to gingerbread houses and farmhouse jams are on offer. And this season, the little French town will also celebrate the newly renovated and expanded Musée Unterlinden when it opens on Saturday. Located in a cloistered 13th-century Dominican convent, the museum is one of the most visited small museums in France and is best known for its Isenheim Altarpiece, which was sculpted and painted by the German artists Niclaus of Haugenau and Matthias Grünewald respectively between 1512 and 1516. As most of its visitors know, the museum houses medieval and early Renaissance paintings and sculptures from the upper Rhine valley, including a large number of drawings, engravings and woodcuts by artists like Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach and Hans Holbein. Less well known is its exceptional collection of modern and contemporary art — with major works by Pablo Picasso, Jean Dubuffet and Robert Delaunay, among others — which it could never display in its entirety for lack of space. And so the remodel served to expand — and modernize.
t-magazine/travel,In 2012, Colmar decided to convert the adjacent former municipal baths, built in 1906, into galleries and offices for the museum, and to construct additional galleries. The commission was awarded to the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, whose latest projects have included the Tate Modern in London and the Pérez Art Museum in Miami. To create a visual connection between the vastly different architectural styles of the 13th-century convent and the Belle Epoque municipal baths, Herzog & de Meuron exposed a previously covered branch of a local river that flows between the two buildings. Lined with the same pink sandstone that has been a defining element of Alsace’s architecture since the construction of the Romanesque abbey of Marmoutier in the 1100s — and Strasbourg’s spectacular gothic cathedral in the 1400s — the banks, now planted with linden trees, invite pedestrians to stop and rest, and give the museum’s buildings a soft unity. An underground gallery connects the convent to the municipal baths building; and the architects clad the new above-ground galleries, which display the museum’s collection of modern masters, in dark rose-colored brick with copper-sheathed roofs. Medieval design elements — arched windows, spiral staircases, white lime-painted walls — complete the continuity throughout. In the chapel, where the celebrated Isenheim altarpiece is displayed, oak parquet now covers the original slate floor; the space is at once lighter and more modern as a result. “Our idea was to make medieval art vivid,” says the head curator Pantxika de Paepe, “and emotionally proximate and provocative.”

fashion,Where Masters and Mistresses of the Universe Can Have It All - The New York Times Not long ago, a shiny, glass-and-metal shopping mall appeared in Lower Manhattan, the kind of thing Manhattan natives (your stopgap Critical Shopper included) longed for in their foolish youths when suburban friends would floss and brag. It is called Brookfield Place, and behind its streak-free panes wait Diane von Furstenberg and J. Crew, Burberry and Bottega Veneta, a Lululemon and a designer gym to wear it in. These are difficult days for the brick-and-mortar retail business, which is fighting against the forces of ease, convenience and Amazon.com, so the arrival of a megamall seems like a strange eruption. But Brookfield, a stone’s throw from the 9/11 Memorial, is closer still to the gleaming office towers that house American Express, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, some of which are accessible from its well-appointed elevator banks. What the good old mall meant to gum-popping high schoolers, this one aims to mean to blue-chip M.B.A.s with budgets to burn. Want to meet at the food court for curly fries at the nerve center of American capitalism? Touching down here is Saks Fifth Avenue, a New York landmark now untethered from its iconic address and off to explore a new New York. It arrived like an 86,000-square-foot emissary from one of the city’s stateliest dowagers. Of course, “downtown” is as much a state of mind as an address. Even stocked with designer labels picked for maximum cool (edgy entrants like Vetements, whose fully unstructured Carhartt work-apron dress will run you $1,210), Saks, with its manicured gleam and full floor of private salons, feels less downtown than Uptown South.
fashion,That’s not to say it is without the zing of surprise. “Where would you wear these?” wondered Hannah, the girlfriend I enlisted to vet the Saks women’s assortment with me. She had in her hands a pair of Miu Miu slides, upholstered in a faux fuzz the color of Cookie Monster and topped with imitation pearls ($950). They were never meant for the touch of the subway platform. But they would be perfect for a spin around Saks, which resembles a clean, well-lighted spacecraft, with rack after rack of clothes in the round. The shoe salon radiates concentrically outward from an enormous bubbled chandelier, and the designer fashion section orbits around a central bank of escalators and a kicky display that changes monthly. (It is currently given over to the exuberant designs of Rosie Assoulin, a riot of deck chairs on a packing-peanut “beach.” Summer share!) The point of this Saks is bounty: the way the racks groan with clothes, one leading seamlessly, and slightly disorientingly, to the next. The masters of the universe who work upstairs (and whose families are penthoused nearby) are used to having it all, and Saks seems determined to offer it all to them. It is organized by designer, and the gang’s all here: the rowdy Americans (Marc Jacobs, Alexander Wang, Proenza Schouler), the elegant Europeans (Chloé, Akris), the flouncy, convention-flouting avant-garde (Comme des Garçons, Sacai, Simone Rocha). There are spaces for more moderately priced “contemporary” clothes, denim, handbags and beauty products, but because of the mostly open layout, everything runs together, even in defiance of logic.
fashion,A Baja East tie-dyed T-shirt featuring the “Minions” characters (“very Venice boardwalk,” Hannah said) hangs a few feet from dressy office garb by Akris’s Punto line. (The same issue prevails on a smaller scale at the Saks men’s store across the mall, where racks of outgoing pieces by Thom Browne, Lanvin and Off-White segue into Saks’s more conservative private label, for maximum sartorial whiplash.) A focused trip through Saks — the kind you might make on a lunch-break search mission — can yield treasures. Hannah found clunky-heeled shoes by Dries Van Noten that stopped her short, bright separates from A.L.C. and Alice + Olivia, and an asymmetrical tie-front dress in a lipstick red by Proenza Schouler ($1,850) that she loved. “This is the sort of thing that makes me wish I was invited to luncheons,” she said, giving it a spin in front of a dressing room mirror as a hopeful clerk looked on. But in the absence of a tighter edit, overabundance can lead to exhaustion. Trendy pieces — the patch-studded jean jacket, the men’s-wear-style shirt — appear with slight variations (and at different prices) across brands. Variety can be a virtue, but this recurrence makes much of the offering feel like a mountain of merchandise in search of a stern curator, special items adrift in mere swag. “Some of it feels like stuff for the Kardashians to put into their closets and never look at again,” Hannah said.
fashion,A full-throttle Saks expedition could legitimately require a vacation afterward. Here, too, of course, the store is ready to help. An exclusive selection of sweatshirts ($95) and hoodies ($115) by the New York label Knowlita teases a certain tribe’s favorite escapes: “St. Barth or Nowhere”; “The Cape or Nowhere”; and, perhaps hopefully, “Saks or Nowhere.”
sports/ncaafootball,Tyler Varga of Yale Blasts Off to an Unstoppable Start - The New York Times NEW HAVEN — A photo ran in the sports section of Monday’s edition of the Yale student newspaper that sent the associate athletic director, Steve Conn, tearing through his office, asking anybody he could find: “Do you remember this play? Do you?” None could immediately place it. Few would blame them. It happened quickly, and maybe to those unfamiliar with football — or physics — it would not be so remarkable. But Conn knew: Not every day does a 5-foot-11, 225-pound running back outrace everybody for 60 yards, twist his torso 180 degrees around midstride and deliver a forceful right elbow to a defender, flinging him off his feet, while never losing balance to score his fifth touchdown run of the game. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” said the author and Yale football historian Rich Marazzi. There have been more than a few similar comments about Tyler Varga’s play for the 4-1 Bulldogs, who host 1-4 Penn on Saturday. He has appeared, at times, to be unstoppable — a running back built like a nuclear warhead, with a bodybuilder’s physique (thanks to his parents) and a gymnast’s sense of balance (thanks to his childhood). Varga has rushed for 12 touchdowns, which is more than all but four players in the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football Championship Subdivision combined. His 141.8 rushing yards per game are the most in the Ivy League by 52. In only 19 career games, he is seventh in Yale history with 2,082 yards.
sports/ncaafootball,That has Varga, an Ontario native, being compared to some of Yale’s most hallowed runners — Calvin Hill, Dick Jauron and Rich Diana — halfway through his senior season. “I wish I had him,” said Carmen Cozza, who coached Yale from 1965 until 1996. “I wouldn’t classify him, because it’s too hard to compare between the ’60s and now. But I wish I had him.” Walking through campus this week toward his neo-gothic dormitory on Wall Street, Varga detailed what he believed set him apart from other backs in a league that — like most of football — has lately revolved around the passing game. It stems from a meticulous diet and workout habits that have his teammates looking sideways at him as if he has lost his mind. “I don’t know if there’s anybody else in the Ivy League that’s as extreme,” Varga said. “It’s not something that I do to please others or make myself proud. I do it to make myself better.” To wit, there is Varga lifting weights in the recreational gym after the team lifted in the varsity gym. His wake-up-every-two-hours-to-eat meal plan. The Tupperware containers of plain rice and egg whites he brings to classes. “He often jokes about his diet,” Varga’s father, John, wrote in an email, “saying that he stopped eating for taste a long time ago.” The discipline and self-regard stem from his parents, who were national-level competitive bodybuilders. In Kitchener, Ontario, about an hour west of Toronto, Varga was raised to understand how to supplement his athletic endeavors, be they gymnastics, judo, ski racing, baseball or, eventually, football.
sports/ncaafootball,But Varga still had difficulty getting noticed by American colleges, while Canadian universities flooded his home with offers. Baylor and Duke showed interest, but a torn peroneal tendon — which connects the calf muscle to the foot — during his final high school game scared away most programs, especially when compartment syndrome restricted blood flow, and doctors grew concerned that the foot would become gangrenous. One undeterred coach was Tony Reno, who was in charge of special teams at Harvard at the time. When Reno was hired as the Yale head coach in January 2012, he said, a whiteboard in his office contained the names of all the prospects the previous staff had been looking at. Reno erased every name but one. Varga had just finished his freshman year at the University of Western Ontario, fully recovered from the foot injury, and had been named the league’s rookie of the year. He was looking to transfer to the Ivy League, where he could study pre-med, so he sent Reno an email of congratulations. Reno called right away. “We knew what talent he had,” Reno said. “We’re very fortunate that it worked out.” His first fall, Varga led the nation with 194.2 all-purpose yards per game while playing running back and option quarterback, as well as returning kicks for an injury-riddled Yale team that finished 2-8. He looked so impressive that an anonymous phone call to the N.C.A.A. before the Dartmouth game questioned Varga’s instant eligibility as a transfer from Canada. After nearly two weeks of deliberation — Varga sat out the game, a 34-14 loss — the N.C.A.A. cleared him to play the rest of the season.
sports/ncaafootball,But there was little precedent for his instant success on a different field size, with different rules, in a different country. Yale was initially unsure whether to list him as a sophomore or a freshman. But Varga clearly did not have much difficulty making the transition. “The length of the field doesn’t really matter anyway,” Varga said. “You’re just trying to run to the end zone.” For Reno, Varga has been the perfect specimen to illustrate the benefits of Reno’s new focus on nutrition and body maintenance, although he chuckles about the Tupperware. And the photo? That’s just Tyler, Reno said. “If you give him a crease and he doesn’t have to hit anybody, he’ll go through it,” Reno said. “But sometimes he takes the road less traveled.”
world/europe,Schooled in Scandal: What Makes Ukraine a Hotbed of Intrigue - The New York Times POLTAVA, Ukraine — After four years of investigation by the German police, the F.B.I. and other crime-fighting agencies around the world, heavily armed security officers stormed an apartment in the central Ukrainian town of Poltava. After a brief exchange of gunfire, they captured their prey: the man suspected of leading a cybercrime gang accused of stealing more than $100 million. The arrest of Gennadi Kapkanov, 33, a Russian-born Ukrainian hacker, and the takedown of Avalanche, a vast network of computers he and his confederates were accused of hijacking through malware and turning into a global criminal enterprise, won a rare round of applause for Ukraine from its frequently dispirited Western backers. By the following day, however, Mr. Kapkanov had disappeared. A judge in a district court in Poltava turned down a prosecution request that he be held in preventive custody for 40 days, and ordered him set free. Mr. Kapkanov has not been seen since. Whether Mr. Kapkanov’s flight was the result of corruption, incompetence or a mix of the two has not been clearly established. The prosecutor general in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, threatened to fire the local prosecutor but backed off when it became clear that the case had been handled by one of his own deputies. The Poltava debacle helps explain why Ukraine, a land of so much promise thanks to its educated population, fertile farmland and vibrant civil society, has a tendency instead to generate so many headline-grabbing scandals.
world/europe,Over the past year, Ukraine has been battered by revelations: off-the-books payments to President Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; the creation in Ukraine of malware used in hacking attacks by Russia during the 2016 American presidential election; and speculation that its Soviet-era missile technology may have been smuggled to North Korea. The sagas are unrelated in their substance and timing. Mr. Manafort’s activities in Ukraine predate Ukraine’s 2014 revolution, while the others follow it. But they all flow in part from the same dysfunctions of a weak state gnawed by corruption and thrown off balance by constant Russian pressure, and the open vistas of opportunity for skulduggery that these have offered. “Why is there so much noise around Ukraine? Because Ukraine is the epicenter of the confrontation between the Western democratic world and authoritarian, totalitarian states,” Oleksandr Turchynov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defense council, said in an interview. He denounced reports of Ukraine providing missiles to North Korea as Russian disinformation aimed at undermining Western support. But while Russia has worked steadily since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union to weaken Ukraine and keep it within Moscow’s orbit of influence — first through economic pressure and political meddling and then military aggression — Ukraine has also enfeebled itself. “The thread that ties strange things together in Ukraine is nearly always corruption,” said Serhiy A. Leshchenko, an opposition member of the Ukrainian Parliament and vociferous critic of President Petro O. Poroshenko.
world/europe,Mr. Poroshenko, he conceded, is better than his predecessor, the kleptocratic, pro-Russian leader — and former Manafort client — Viktor F. Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February 2014 after months of street protests in Kiev. “But that is only because he is weaker, and society is much stronger,” Mr. Leshchenko said. Mr. Poroshenko, unlike his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir V. Putin, also has to contend with a lively free press that delights in probing and exposing government stumbles and the maneuvers of self-dealing insiders. And unlike the three Baltic States, which enjoyed brief periods of independence between the First and Second World Wars, Ukraine has only an acute awareness of centuries of subjugation by outside powers, among them Poland, Austria and Russia, that left its people inherently wary of authority. “What is Ukraine’s national idea? It is resistance to authority,” said Taras Chornovil, a former adviser to Mr. Yanukovych. Ukraine’s painful history as a put-upon appendage has left it ill-equipped to curb unruly habits at odds with the rule-based, scandal-shy order of the European Union, which it aspires to join. “Its attempts to stay democratic while building a nation are often messy, its oligarchs all powerful and, given the virtual absence of state control over media and oligarchic competition, post-Soviet corruption is out in the open,” said Serhii Plokhii, a Harvard professor and the author of a history of Ukraine.
world/europe,Ukraine’s domestic intelligence service, or S.B.U., its powers of surveillance greatly enhanced by monitoring equipment provided by the United States after Mr. Yanukovych decamped to Russia, has added its own highly selective and distorted form of transparency by leaking information about alleged wrongdoing, often for political or financial gain. Controlled by Mr. Poroshenko, the S.B.U. has become a tool in domestic political and business battles, with anti-corruption activists accusing it of working to undermine, not help, their cause. While still politically influenced, Ukrainian law enforcement is no longer the swamp of incompetence and corruption it once was. It has been able to monitor Mr. Manafort’s former business associates and turn up evidence of Russian hacking in the 2016 United States election, in part owing to American technical support. The Central Intelligence Agency tore out a Russian-provided cellphone surveillance system, and put in American-supplied computers, said Viktoria Gorbuz, a former head of a liaison office at the S.B.U. that worked with foreign governments. Ms. Gorbuz’s department translated telephone intercepts from the new system and forwarded them to the Americans. “This team would translate and immediately, 24 hours a day, be in full cooperation with our American colleagues,” she said. It is unclear whether any phone intercepts relevant to the election meddling investigation have gone to the American authorities. But a Ukrainian law enforcement official has given journalists partial phone records of former associates of Mr. Manafort.
world/europe,Dismantling Russian spy gear, however, proved far easier than purging Russian power, which has shadowed Ukraine constantly since it declared independence in 1991 but became far more aggressive in recent years. Since March 2014 Ukraine has lost Crimea to Russian annexation and large chunks of its industrial heartland in the east to rebels backed by fighters and weapons from Russia. It has also been used as a testing ground by Moscow for disinformation and hacking techniques later deployed during presidential election campaigns in the United States and France. Ukrainian officials invariably cite Russian meddling to explain why anti-corruption and other steps demanded by the West have often faltered. While Russia is a convenient excuse, it is also a very real menace. In Poltava, the center of town is dominated by a czarist-era monument to Russia’s victory over Sweden in a 1709 battle that sealed Russia’s rise as the region’s pre-eminent power and ended Ukrainians’ early aspirations for their own state. Now draped in Ukrainian flags, the monument nonetheless stands as a powerful reminder of Russia’s looming presence in a country that has struggled to create a functioning independent state on the fragile foundations left by more than 70 years of communism and centuries of subjugation by Russian czars. Igor Gavrilenko, a lecturer in Ukrainian history at the Poltava National Technical University, said the release of Mr. Kapkanov, the man accused of being a cybercrime kingpin, was typical of the dysfunction that has plagued Ukraine.
world/europe,“The whole situation is absurd, but nothing in my country really surprises me anymore,” he said, sitting in a park near the Poltava battle monument. “Ukraine is a country where anything is possible if you have money.” It was to Ukraine that Mr. Manafort looked for new business horizons after doing work for despots in Africa and Asia. Setting up shop in Kiev, he became entangled in a murky constellation of Russian and Ukrainian business tycoons and politicians, notably Mr. Yanukovych, the president ousted in 2014. Mr. Chornovil, who worked as Mr. Yanukovych’s campaign manager in 2004, remembers Mr. Manafort as “arrogant and full of self-confidence,” a showman who liked to organize big, splashy events that required lavish spending. A secret ledger recording payments to Mr. Manafort and others, he said, was part of a crude effort to keep track of all the money sloshing through Mr. Yanukovych’s administration. “Everyone was stealing, and the party wanted a record of who got what,” Mr. Chornovil. “They never imagined that they might lose power one day and the accounts would come to light.” Mr. Manafort, he said, often clashed with members of the president’s entourage but “had a colossal influence on Yanukovych for some reason.” He added: “He was not here out of any ideology but to make money. He was here exclusively for the money.” The end of Mr. Yanukovych’s rule in 2014 upended Mr. Manafort’s business in Kiev and brought in Mr. Poroshenko on a wave of reformist fervor.
world/europe,Left in place, however, was what has for years been Ukraine’s strength as a pluralistic society and also its fundamental flaw: a fragile state that is too fragmented by competing economic and regional interests to impose either Russian-style authoritarianism or European-style rule of law. “There was never a strong state on this land. Medieval feudal mosaics, fragile kingdoms and early-modern Cossack republics had nothing in common with European absolutism or Russian authoritarianism,” said Valerii Pekar, a lecturer at the Kiev-Mohyla Business School, in a recent article. “This is a country of balance, not of leadership. Nobody can rule Ukraine like a king.” The West, fed up with the dysfunction, has been pushing Mr. Poroshenko with only partial success to tip the balance away from the corruption-tainted oligarchs and Russian proxies who often held sway under Mr. Yanukovych. He did establish an independent anti-corruption agency and introduce a mandatory declaration of assets for officials and members of Parliament. But he has so far stalled on setting up a tribunal outside the existing court system to try corruption cases. Larissa Kulishova, the judge in Poltava who let the hacker go, denied that she had erred. In a brief interview, the judge said she had made her ruling “in full accordance with Ukrainian and European law.” She disputed an appeals court judgment issued after the hacker had fled that overturned her decision and said she had been wrong: “I don’t think I made a mistake.”
world/europe,Larissa Golnyk, a judge in the same courthouse, said she could not speculate on what prompted her fellow judge to free Mr. Kapkanov but expressed dismay at the decision. Ms. Golnyk has bitter experience of the pressures put on judges. Equipped with a secret camera by anti-corruption investigators, she filmed a representative of Poltava’s mayor offering her a $5,000 bribe to close a case. Posted online, the video produced a public uproar but no action against the mayor or his emissary. “Every time something clearly wrong happens I ask, ‘How can this be happening?’” Ms. Golnyk said. “I am always told, ‘Come on, you must be used to such things by now.’”
sports/baseball,Reliever Ryan Madson Helps the Royals in a Roundabout Way - The New York Times KANSAS CITY, Mo. — One of the severely tested theorems of this postseason is that when bad things happen to Ryan Madson, good things happen to the Kansas City Royals. When Madson gave up two home runs, putting the Royals four runs behind the Houston Astros and just six outs from elimination, it set the stage for a dramatic rally and an eventual American League division series victory. When Madson surrendered a tying home run to the Blue Jays’ Jose Bautista on Friday night, it served as a prelude to Lorenzo Cain’s dash around the bases and closer Wade Davis’s high-voltage escape in the league championship series clincher against Toronto. “Maybe it did happen for a reason,” Madson, a right-handed reliever, said with a smile. Neat, linear explanations have rarely followed Madson in recent years, when his big free-agent payday blew up and his right elbow blew out, leaving him settled into retirement at this time last year, doting on his five children and driving around with a portable mound, giving pitching lessons to teenagers near his home in Temecula, Calif. One lesson with a promising young high school pitcher set Madson, 35, on a path toward Kansas City. After having thrown a total of one minor league inning in the previous three years, he has emerged as a vital cog in the vaunted Royals bullpen.
sports/baseball,As he began to work with the prospect, Johnny Morrell, Madson taught him about some of the changes he made to his delivery during a lengthy rehab, which included a failed stint with the Los Angeles Angels in 2013. Madson, who had gained 30 pounds — mostly in his legs and back — had overhauled his mechanics trying to ease the strain on his pitching elbow. As he played catch with Morrell and occasionally threw off the mound, Madson began to think he could still pitch. When his son turned on a ballgame last summer, and Madson watched the cat-and-mouse game between pitchers and hitters, he began to miss it. “I probably wouldn’t have had the spark to get back into it,” Madson said of the workouts. “I probably would have waited and procrastinated and been content with being at home raising the kids. Nobody was reaching out to me. I’d say there was a 90-95 percent chance that, no, I wouldn’t be here.” So Madson called a Royals adviser, Jim Fregosi Jr., who had signed Madson out of high school in 1998 for the Philadelphia Phillies and had always told him to call if he needed anything. He asked if he could come to training camp. When Manager Ned Yost was asked what he expected from Madson, he said: “Nothing. Nothing.” Yost said he looked at the camp roster and spotted Madson and Joe Blanton, who was out of baseball last year almost all of last season, and wondered, “What are these guys doing here?”
sports/baseball,A few years ago, nobody would have wondered that. After 2011, when Madson had 32 saves in 34 chances for the 102-win Phillies, he hit the free-agent market. His agent at the time, Scott Boras, was negotiating a contract to remain with the Phillies. “I remember seeing my name and a four-year, $44 million contract on the bottom of the TV,” Madson said. “It said we’d agreed to terms on it. That’s where things went awry.” Madson said Boras told him the Phillies reneged on a verbal agreement. Ruben Amaro Jr., then the team’s general manager, told Madson they had never agreed on a fourth year. The day after the agreement fell apart, the Phillies signed Jonathan Papelbon to a four-year, $50 million contract. Madson settled for a one-year, $8.5 million deal with Cincinnati. He regrets not being more involved, saying he would have accepted three years. “That was the toughest,” said Madson, who earned $1 million this season with incentives. “I’ve made some money prior to that and I’ve made some money post that, but to have that contract for a guy from Moreno Valley, Calif., to make $30 million — movie stars make that. That’s ridiculous. So I lost that. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me, as far as baseball goes, maybe in life. That started the whole journey.” Barely a week into spring training with the Reds, Madson’s elbow gave out.
sports/baseball,Dr. James Andrews performed Tommy John surgery, and Madson signed with the Angels the next season. But his fastball never got past 93 miles per hour without any pain the next day. He pitched one inning for an Angels minor league affiliate and was released in August. “You’re like, ‘Why doesn’t it just work?’ ” Madson said. “It was the first time I had the sense that this game could be over for me.” Johnny Cuello, a teammate with the Angels, badgered Madson about a clinic in Phoenix that did work with biomechanics. Madson was hooked up to sensors that sent electrodes through his muscles, forcing him to relearn how to pitch. After three months, he performed for about 20 scouts in January 2014, but nobody offered an invitation to major league camp. So Madson went home. As he retreated to the dugout Friday night, after allowing Bautista’s home run, he felt the weight of his journey. When Madson had served as a successful setup man for the Phillies during their 2008 World Series title run, he had pitched without anything on his mind but the next pitch. “I was in the fight,” he said. “I was in the fire.” Now, though, it is different. “I’m wrapping everything I’ve been through into each of those games,” said Madson, who had a 4-2 record and a career-low 2.13 earned run average in the regular season.
sports/baseball,“I had a whole season to prove it, but now I feel like everything’s been doubled up into these high-profile games,” he said. “It hasn’t boded well for me. That’s where I need to learn my lesson.” So Madson, whose family will be at Tuesday’s opener along with Morrell, will try to breathe deeply, and maintain the proper mechanics so that his old habits do not leak back, like the fastball to Bautista, meant to be delivered low and away, that arrived letter high. It would be nice, he says, to have a role in these stirring playoff victories — other than setting the stage for them.
us,Funding Gap Hinders Law for Ensuring Food Safety - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  After thousands of people were sickened by tainted eggs, peanut butter and spinach, Congress passed a sweeping food safety law in 2010 that gave the Food and Drug Administration new powers to prevent additional outbreaks. But lawmakers have not provided enough money for the mission. The Congressional Budget Office said the F.D.A. would need a total of $580 million from 2011 to 2015 to carry out the changes required by the Food Safety Modernization Act. So far, Congress has appropriated less than half of that amount, even as the agency is moving to issue crucial rules under the law this year. “I don’t think it’s too much to say that the success” of the overhaul “is on the line,” Michael R. Taylor, the deputy F.D.A. commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, said in an interview. “We have good plans for moving forward. The problem is we don’t have the money.” An estimated 48 million Americans have food-borne illnesses each year, and agency officials say the funding shortfall could undermine Congress’s intent to make the most significant improvements to the food safety system in more than 70 years. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who helped write the law, said the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the F.D.A., shared some of the blame for the shortfall because they had tried to impose user fees on the food industry to help fund the law. The F.D.A. relies on user fees for a number of other programs.
us,In its previous five budget requests, the F.D.A. proposed user fees that would cover the bulk of the cost of carrying out the food safety law. Last year, for example, it asked for $263 million for the law, with about $229 million coming from fees on food companies. But lawmakers soundly rejected those proposals after lobbying by the food industry. Ms. DeLauro helped write a letter last year asking the Obama administration to request the necessary funding through a federal appropriation. “User fees are a nonstarter,” she said in an interview. “They are just not going to get through Congress.” After receiving an appropriation of $27.5 million for the law in the current fiscal year, the F.D.A. asked Congress to allocate $109.5 million for the coming year. But it remains to be seen if the Republican-led Congress, given the mood for cutting spending, will approve the higher amount. Even if the agency receives it, the figure would be just half of what the budget office says is necessary. “If we keep shortchanging the F.D.A., it will continue to cost us billions of dollars a year to deal with food-borne illness,” said Ms. DeLauro, a member of the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the agency’s funding. The food safety law puts the burden on food companies to make sure that their products are safe, instead of relying largely on inspectors from the understaffed F.D.A. It requires better record-keeping, contingency plans for handling outbreaks and measures to prevent the spread of contaminants. It also gives the agency the power to issue recalls, something it could not do previously.
us,Consumer groups have accused the Obama administration of being slow to move the rules through the regulatory process. They sued in 2012 to force the F.D.A. to accelerate its timetable on issuing final rules. A settlement was reached last year, and the agency will publish some of the final regulations this year. Mr. Taylor, the F.D.A. official, said that the agency had been able to issue new rules, including those for produce and processed foods, but that funding shortfalls would make it difficult to modernize its inspection processes and retrain about 2,000 inspectors and other staff members for the new requirements. He also said that the agency would have problems providing guidance and technical assistance to the states, which conduct inspections under contract with the F.D.A. In addition, he said, it will be difficult for the agency to properly oversee food imports. “If they don’t have the capacity to enforce it, the law is not going to be worth the paper it’s written on,” said Tony Corbo, a lobbyist for Food & Water Watch, a consumer group. At a hearing on the F.D.A.’s budget last month, Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that he was concerned about the size of the agency’s overall budget request and that the request for more than $100 million for the food safety law “will be tough to swallow.”
us,According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 128,000 people are hospitalized each year with food-related illnesses, and 3,000 die. The cost of treatment and lost income is $15 billion a year or more, according to data from the Agriculture Department. The food safety law is intended to change the F.D.A.’s inspection system, which critics say provides inadequate oversight of the billions of pounds of food produced and eaten each year. The food safety system is spread out over more than 15 agencies, but the F.D.A. is responsible for the bulk of what Americans eat. Under the law, the agency is supposed to increase its inspections of foreign food facilities that export to the United States. But a report by the Government Accountability Office found that the agency had not kept up with the pace of inspections mandated by Congress. Lawmakers required the F.D.A. to inspect 600 foreign food plants in the first year after the measure was passed. In each of the next five years, the agency was supposed to inspect at least twice the number of facilities reviewed the previous year. It should have inspected at least 4,800 facilities in 2014, according to the accountability office, but it inspected only 1,323. The office also noted that the F.D.A. continued to have problems filling staff positions that were supposed to help with the oversight of foreign food plants.
us,Despite the funding shortfalls, some food safety advocates say they are optimistic that Congress will ultimately give the agency the money it needs to protect consumers and modernize a food safety system that has been in place for nearly a century. “Is the funding request enough? No,” said Colin O’Neil, the director of government affairs for the Center for Food Safety, one of the groups that sued the F.D.A. “But it gets us on the way. It’s going to be a long fight. But I think we will get there.”
us,Across Generations, Traces of a Poor Maid’s Murder - The New York Times WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. One hundred fifteen years ago this month, on open land now occupied by warehouses and office buildings, a bantam of a man mounted the gallows built in his dishonor. He raised his hat and bowed before the 6,000 people gathered to see the floor beneath him drop. He carried a small Bible. A trial six months earlier had laid out how this ne’er-do-well of 22, Peter DeGraff, had charmed a poor, simple woman named Ellen Smith. How she followed him around town like a puppy after their child was lost at birth. How he avoided her, accused her of being with other men, muttered that he’d like to kill her. How he sent her a note fraught with misspellings one day, sweetly requesting she meet him by a spring close to where people now play tennis, down the hill from the Zinzendorf Hotel, long gone. How he shot her through the heart, his gun so close that its powder singed the outfit she had chosen for what she thought would be a romantic reconciliation. How she was not yet 20. DeGraff fled for a while, but eventually returned to town for reasons unknown and was captured. All the while he maintained his innocence, even though his sweet note had been found tucked in the bosom of poor Ellen Smith.
us,The solemn words of a few dignitaries on the scaffold did little to stem the giddy mood coursing through the large crowd, though some paused long enough to join in singing the hymn “Am I a Soldier of the Cross?” DeGraff sang along, a rope around his neck. Then with his last words the condemned man finally confessed to murdering the uneducated maid, saying, “The only words she said after I shot were, ‘Lord have mercy on me.’ ” DeGraff implored his listeners to stay away from whiskey, bad women and dice. He shook hands with everyone on the scaffold, including his two brothers. And just before his pale face disappeared behind a black hood, he handed his hat and his Bible to his brother Lee. Moments later, he was dancing on air. Then he was hanging limp, a human exclamation point to the last public hanging in Forsyth County. Although most murders fade quickly from collective memory, every now and then one lingers awhile in the public consciousness. So it was with the murder of Ellen Smith, which stayed with Winston-Salem long after both killer and victim were committed to quickly forgotten graves. Perhaps this was because the case helped to end public hangings; the grotesquerie seemed not worth the delivery of the message, Let this be a lesson to you. Or maybe because DeGraff, a hard-drinking, hard-gambling scoundrel, was so reviled that his surname entered the local lexicon, as in: He DeGraffed away.
us,Jennifer Bean Bower, a Winston-Salem historian who has written about the case, cites the power of oral tradition, a power transcending the passage of 115 years. “There were a lot of people who remembered,” she says. “People who were children who saw the hanging and told their descendants.” Finally, there is the murder ballad called “Poor Ellen Smith.” Often and perhaps wrongly attributed to Peter DeGraff, the song rang out from front porches and concert halls, its haunting words recorded over the years by everyone from the Kingston Trio to Neko Case. Poor Ellen Smith, how was she found? Shot through the heart lying dead on the ground. For the DeGraff family and their descendants, though, the story of their blood shedding blood was nothing to sing about. “This was never discussed,” recalls Edith DeGraff Thornett. The other evening Ms. Thornett, 70, sat at her daughter’s kitchen table in a rural stretch outside of Greensboro, resting before her night shift as a hospital secretary. She grew up in the house of her beloved grandfather, Lee DeGraff, a tombstone engraver who never once mentioned to her the day he stood on the gallows and accepted a hat and a Bible from his condemned sibling. When she was about 14, Ms. Thornett overheard a stranger ask a family member if he was any kin to Peter DeGraff, a name she had never heard before. She decided to investigate. Soon, she found a photograph hidden behind a framed portrait of her great-grandmother: it was of a man wearing a hat, her great-uncle Peter. Then she found a Bible that, if memory serves, bore Peter DeGraff’s name.
us,But the Bible suddenly vanished; she never saw it again. Looking back, she suspects her grandmother became concerned with her growing curiosity and disposed of the Good Book. A few hours after Ms. Thornett recalled those days, a cousin of hers, Randy Furches, 52, sat down before the open microphone at a Winston-Salem place called The Garage. A regional sales director by profession, he decided a few years ago that pop music was his passion, and he has been writing and singing ever since. He first heard of Peter DeGraff in 1979 from his mother, Mildred Miller Furches, another great-niece of Peter DeGraff’s. She pointed out a newspaper article marking the 85th anniversary of Winston-Salem’s most famous murder case and said, You probably should know your ties to this. Ms. Furches recalled last week that her father would occasionally talk about the case, which had loomed so large in his own childhood: how his Uncle Peter had said he was sorry from the gallows; how he had tried to steer people from wine, women and gambling. “We weren’t ashamed of it,” she said. “But it was something you didn’t go out and broadcast.” For many years the connection meant nothing to Mr. Furches. But after hearing “Poor Ellen Smith” for the first time a year or so ago, he felt moved to write some verses clearly stating that Peter DeGraff was the killer, but also suggesting he was more in love with his victim than the record suggests.
us,The lyrics new and old echoed through The Garage, where young performers waited for their turn on stage and a massive silver fan stirred the smoky air. Now I’m in jail, a prisoner am I, But I know God is with me, hears every cry. The morning after Mr. Furches’s performance, his mother received a phone call from one of her DeGraff cousins, Earsley Nifong Fulton, who had just read a story in The Winston-Salem Journal about his version of “Poor Ellen Smith.” By the way, she said in passing, she had this old Bible, and Peter DeGraff’s name is in the back of it. Within an hour Mr. Furches was at Ms. Fulton’s door in the village of Clemmons. A slight woman of 88, she talked about how some DeGraff families explained the connection to their children, and how others never mentioned it. “They say Aunt Nettie never did tell her children,” she said. In her fine hands she held the small Bible that Peter DeGraff most likely carried with him to the gallows. It had come into her possession many years ago, she said, and by a confusing, circuitous way. But here it was, worn and missing the first part of Genesis. The back flap bears the signature of Peter DeGraff, and the date 1893, the year he was imprisoned and convicted. Also appearing are the handwritten words, “This is for God that sav my sol.”
us,Ms. Fulton had stored the Bible for years with Civil War memorabilia and other family things upstairs. But now, she said, she will keep it downstairs, in the living room.
travel,In Berlin, History Squares Off Against Hip - The New York Times Berlin is a divided city. Not between East and West, of course, but between serious and fun. There’s a generational and attitudinal wall bisecting the city that at times can seem almost as insurmountable as the one that once separated the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. And I didn’t want to have fun. I went to Berlin for a few days last summer to immerse myself in the most infamous milestones of 20th-century history. But I was visiting my 21-year-old daughter, Emma, who was working there that summer because it is, as she put it, “the coolest place on earth.” We explored together, and Emma quite gamely came along to many Holocaust memorials, World War II exhibits, former Stasi prisons, Checkpoint Charlie, Soviet monuments, synagogues, learning centers, cemeteries and remnants of the Berlin Wall, all part of what Emma calls the Stations of the Iron Cross. And even I found it impossible to ignore the vibrancy and bohemian chic in fair-trade coffee shops, vegan restaurants, art galleries, squats, comic book stores, vintage shops, street fairs, at concerts, on bike paths and inside all those throbbing, black-lit nightclubs that were emptying at the same time I was going out for morning coffee. That’s the Berlin that Emma wouldn’t allow me to describe as “hipster,” a word that she says is as dismissive to her generation as “yuppie” or “preppy” were to mine. But it’s a beard, bike and baby-stroller world that feels like Brooklyn and even the weirder precincts on the TV comedy “Portlandia.”
travel,I was visiting Berlin, but she was living in Berlandia. I wanted to visit the two places at once, but that can be disorienting: It’s a bit like walking in a long funeral cortege and crashing into Coachella. I dipped in warily, staying at a relatively new but stately hotel, Das Stue, which is right next to the Tiergarten in a leafy, sleepy neighborhood of embassies. It’s in western Berlin, though that distinction has become almost as obsolete as the Left Bank versus Right Bank view of Paris. There is no escaping history, though: Das Stue is in a curved 1930s Fascist-style stone building that was designed in concert with Albert Speer’s grandiose plans for the capital. The Nazi regime ordered foreign embassies to move into a diplomatic enclave near the Zoo — it became the Danish embassy in 1940. The entrance is elegant and worldly, and the rooms are sleekly luxurious but with a mod kick, including bathroom taps so cunning and abstruse — chrome cubes with red and blue dots — that showering felt like a cognitive test on Lumosity. Which was fitting, because at times, the whole city felt like an entrance exam I hadn’t studied for. The U-Bahn subway and buses are famously efficient, but just finding the station was a challenge, possibly because I don’t speak any German and brought only two guide books, “PastFinder Berlin 1933-1945” and “PastFinder Berlin 1945-1989.”
travel,Also, Emma and I had a mutually assured dysfunction pact: She wouldn’t let me whip out a map in public (not because she was embarrassed to be taken for a tourist but because I can’t read them), and I wouldn’t let her pile up expensive data-roaming charges looking for directions on my iPhone. In short, it took us four hours and a bus, a train, three subways, one in the wrong direction, and a taxi to make it to the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial, an infamous Stasi prison that was featured in “The Lives of Others.” Because we were so late, we had to piggyback onto the last tour, a group of international students. Our young guide began our tour of padded cells, tiger cages and interrogation rooms in the notorious Special Camp No. 3, where the Soviets, he explained at some length, starved, tortured and murdered many hundreds of prisoners from 1945 until the East German police, known as the Stasi, took over in 1951. One pretty blond Russian in the group kept muttering to her friend and finally blew up. “I’ve had it up to here with ‘the Russians did this, the Russians did that,' " she hissed at him. “We weren’t the Nazis.” The rest of the tour was on tenterhooks. We took a cab back, almost as shaken by the flare-up of international tension as our immersion into the G.D.R.’s regimented, routinized system of repression. I warned Emma that we were by no means done.
travel,The Jewish Museum, in a zigzag building conceived as a deconstructed Star of David, is fascinating, but it’s less a learning center than it is an abstract expression of remorse: Michael Kimmelman, the New York Times architecture critic, called it “the epitome of kitsch.” We spent hours, but learned more about the Holocaust at the Topography of Terror, a glass-and-concrete museum and documentation center built over what were once offices for the Gestapo. Admission is free. Visitors can examine a remnant of the Berlin Wall, as well as the ruins of prison cells. Most of the exhibition examines in harrowing detail the toll of Nazism. Several school groups were there, sitting cross-legged and silent as teachers painstakingly explained what happened in places like Treblinka. It’s a very disturbing and affecting experience, of course. By the end, Emma wondered if she had missed her calling. “Do you think it’s too late to become a Nazi hunter?” she asked. There was more, of course. Much more. The old Stasi headquarters in central Berlin, now the Stasi-Museum Berlin, was creepily fascinating, even down to the stark, midcentury office décor of offices, smoking lounges and interrogation rooms — not West Elm, but certainly East Elm. That served as a prelude to the vast Soviet War Memorial in Berlin’s Treptower Park, one of three memorials to the 80,000 Red Army soldiers who died in the conquest of Berlin; this one also serves as a cemetery for 5,000 Soviet soldiers. It was raining when we finally trudged our way to the centerpiece: a gigantic statue in Socialist Realism style of a Soviet soldier holding a rescued baby and stomping on a swastika beneath his boot.
travel,Hours later, as we limped to the subway stop, soaked, hungry and tired, Emma spoke up. “I’ve got to hand it to you, Mom,” she said, with real admiration in her voice. “You’ve managed to make this city no fun at all.” Emma took charge of dinner and chose a popular Korean restaurant called Kimchi Princess, a cavernous room warmed by graffiti art, blaring music and lighting that turned everything a racy bordello red. It was 7:30, which Emma said was early. But it looked busy to me, communal tables filled with young, mostly English-speaking diners in flannel shirts, tattoos and Warby Parker eyewear, many of them seated across from older couples — mothers in Talbots and dads in J. Press. The chic Korean waitresses who brought us bibimbap and japchae spoke perfect English, and could not have been nicer. It felt like parents’ weekend at Oberlin. And that was true virtually everyplace we went. We did not feel snubbed by bus drivers, burghers or even tall, thin saleswomen in artsy boutiques. Berliners, despite their brash reputation, were eagerly nice, without the frayed patience and contempt that tourists can encounter in Paris or Venice or London. (With one glaring exception, which came later.) We were there in July, before events in Gaza incited anti-Semitic acts in Europe, including in Germany, and before the terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store in Paris. But we saw enough of the nation’s mood management to understand why hate speech is more conspicuous and closely watched in Berlin than, say, Rome.
travel,The Holocaust is still imprinted on the German identity; tolerance continues to be taught in classrooms as intently as Latin once was. In Berlin, in particular, a city split into two for more than four decades, repression is a carefully curated memory: Everywhere we went, there were groups of young Germans on a listening tour of their own failed history. And that may have been part of the reason we were treated so kindly: Berlin, a city that was never quite like any other, is intent on being normal. The more tourists and expats flock to Berlin, the more it becomes just another lively European city, and not merely a reconstituted crucible of tragedy. On the second day, I felt ready to try a more contemporary hotel, and the 25hours Hotel  in western Berlin’s Bikini-Haus complex (in a modernist mall with a High Line-like rooftop park) fit the bill: there are hammocks in the reception floor that overlook the Zoo and a cafe that offers Five Elephants coffee, a local brew from a coffee house run by an American barista who uses an artisanal Dietrich roaster made in Idaho. The hotel’s rooms are designed to look like SoHo lofts, with concretelike floors, futon-style beds, a bike attached to the wall and a glass shower stall in the middle of the room. Robes aren’t made of terrycloth; they are poncholike hoodies in muted shades of gray and beige.
travel,Gunmetal-colored hallways are garnished with curly graffiti art that is somewhere between menacing and cute; an antique mini Cooper is parked in the ground-floor lobby with 1960s music blaring from its radio. On the roof is a delightful bar and terrace restaurant. The whole place looks cool, but also whimsical, or as Emma put it, as if Vibe.com’s headquarters had been decorated by Anthropologie. Emma loved 25hours, but I preferred our third hotel, the cool but more subdued Gorki hotel in Mitte, in eastern Berlin, a converted apartment building where graceful, spacious rooms are called apartments and are equipped with a Nespresso machine and full galley kitchen — perfect for visitors who want to feel like locals. Emma took me to her favorite cafes, vintage shops where clothes are sold by the kilo, record stores, bookstores, wine bars and Sing Blackbird, a high-end boutique/vegan cafe that sells ’70s suede maxi skirts and detox smoothies. (Luckily, we just missed a conceptual food show, the Küchenautomat, a giant condomlike air bubble, or “mobile social sculpture,” that served as an outdoor kitchen in the garden of the Berlinische Galerie, a museum of modern and contemporary art.) I favored Linienstrasse, a quiet, elegant street near the hotel that looked a little like Paris, only instead of historic buildings with plaques indicating eminent former tenants like Lamartine, there was a perfectly preserved eyesore, a dilapidated, crumbling squat covered in colorful graffiti and painted slogans like “Soldiers are Murderers” and “Foreigners in, Nazis out.”
travel,It stands defiantly across the street from a walled garden, a small, leafy churchyard filled with graves of 18th- and 19th-century Prussian officers, some eminent civilians and, inevitably, a mass grave for victims of World War II and the Berlin bombing. Meals in certain sections of the East were disorienting: so like the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and yet so not. We had bagels and shakshuka at Mogg & Melzer, a high-concept deli in a gallery and restaurant complex in what was once a Jewish girls’ school, built in 1930 in the Weimar-era New Objectivity style. (It closed during the war, and many students, teachers and the architect, Alexander Beer, died in the camps.) We had a delicious and glamorous dinner at Lokal, a fashionable farm-to-table restaurant run by a binational couple, Maren Thimm and Gary Hoopengardner. It could have been an intimidating experience: We got there an hour before the 9 p.m. reservation (I was hungry), as groups of casually elegant Germans and other Europeans were lining up. They all looked famous, even though I didn’t know them. Mr. Hoopengardner had a pirate scarf on his head and a slight German intonation, but turned out to be from Cleveland, and he couldn’t have been nicer to two strangers curious about our old, polished wood table, which he said was salvaged from a country schoolhouse by Ms. Thimm’s father. As we left, he gave us the contact number for his brother, who teaches tango in New York.
travel,The only place we encountered a chilly, German minimalist welcome — Dieter in the old “Saturday Night Live” “Sprockets” skit — was at an art gallery in Sammlung Berlin, a building that serves as a concrete timeline of the city’s fate: It was built in 1942 at Hitler’s command as a bunker; served as a Red Army prison in 1945; was used as a fruit cellar for Cuban imports in the Stasi era; and after the wall fell, became a notoriously wild techno-pop music space and S & M sex club. Now, just as fittingly, it is privately owned by Christian and Karen Boros, who have an apartment on the top floor and have turned the underground area into a showcase for their contemporary art collection. The Boros Collection is open to visitors, by appointment and 12 euros, but with evident ambivalence. The first installation is a room filled by giant black curved screens positioned around speakers that amplify the buzzing of fluorescent lights. I asked our guide, a pale, severe young woman in black (I mentally called her Dieterette) why the artist’s name was not on display. She stared at me for several beats then replied, pityingly, “It’s an aesthetic choice.” (“Just by asking,” Emma whispered in my ear, “you’ve already failed.”) Online, I discovered that the artist’s name is Alicja Kwade. We stayed another half hour, then skulked away. After so many good experiences, that one flick of continental snobbery felt especially wounding. It was the only time I felt a pang of regret over reunification and muttered to Emma: “Mr. Gorbachev, build back that wall.”
arts/design,New Damien Hirst Paintings to Be Exhibited in Stately British Home - The New York Times The British artist Damien Hirst will exhibit new works from his series of spot paintings at a stately home in Britain. The exhibition, titled “Colour Space,” will open in March at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, in the southeast of England; the mansion was built in the 1720s for Britain’s first prime minister, Robert Walpole. Roughly 50 of Mr. Hirst’s new works will go on display in the state rooms of a building that once housed a world-class collection of European old master paintings. “I originally wanted the Spots to look like they were painted by a human trying to paint like a machine,” Mr. Hirst said in a statement. “‘Colour Space’ is going back to the human element, so instead you have the fallibility of the human hand in the drips and inconsistencies.” Well-known sculptures by Mr. Hirst will be installed in Houghton’s gardens, including “Charity,” a bronze piece that was previously exhibited outside the Gherkin building in central London. The spots series, a vast collection of more than 1,000 paintings of colorful dots ranging in size, is among Mr. Hirst’s most recognized work, with the oldest pieces dating to 1986. In 2012, Gagosian Gallery exhibited 331 of the paintings across 11 gallery spaces worldwide, including in New York.
arts/design,The New York Times co-chief art critic Roberta Smith wrote of the exhibition, “The New York allotment, at least, is a sideshow but one with redeeming qualities, a spectacle with benefits, which is a lot more than can be said of Mr. Hirst’s previous attention-getting shenanigans, like the all-Hirst auctions or the bejeweled skull.” In the statement, Mr. Hirst said, “There are still no two exact colors that repeat in each painting, which is really important to me. I think of them as cells under a microscope. It felt right to show them somewhere historic rather than in a conventional gallery space and Houghton’s perfect.”
arts/design,Melva Bucksbaum, Art Collector and Curator, Dies at 82 - The New York Times Melva Bucksbaum, who transformed her childhood passion for collecting dolls and glass animals into a career as one of America’s leading art collectors, curators and patrons, died on Sunday at her home in Aspen, Colo. She was 82. The cause was bladder cancer, her husband, Raymond J. Learsy, said. As a 9-year-old in Washington in the early 1940s, Ms. Bucksbaum regularly took the downtown-bound bus from her immigrant parents’ grocery store to escape “into another world” at the National Gallery of Art. She aspired to be an artist, but when her “hand would never do what the head wanted it to do,” she recalled, she started collecting instead. She was president of the Des Moines Art Center board in Iowa, where her first husband, Martin Bucksbaum, pioneered shopping centers and real estate investment trusts. He died in 1995. In New York, she became vice chairwoman of the Whitney Museum of American Art and married Mr. Learsy, a collector of contemporary art, commodities trader, developer and fellow Whitney board member. In 2000, she and her family started the Bucksbaum Award, which every two years grants an artist $100,000 (an amount that has been described as the largest cash award to an individual visual artist) and an invitation to exhibit at the Whitney. Last year, the eighth winner, chosen from 103 participants in the Whitney Biennial, was Zoe Leonard, the photographer and sculptor.
arts/design,Ms. Bucksbaum and Mr. Learsy have been described by ARTnews magazine as being among the world’s leading collectors, owning works by Matisse, David Salle, Richard Serra, Robert Mapplethorpe, Frank Gehry, Terry Winters and Nan Goldin. She also served on several other boards, including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Jewish Museum in New York, the Aspen Institute, the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the International Committee of the Tate Gallery in London, the Drawing Center in New York, the American Friends of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. Last year, she organized “The Distaff Side,” a collection of paintings, sculpture, photographs and video by women — works from the couple’s collection — at their private exhibition space in Sharon, Conn. Melva Jane Venezky was born in Washington on April 5, 1933, the daughter of William Venezky and the former Millie Ruth Bronstein, Jewish immigrants from Russia. She attended the University of Maryland. After Mr. Bucksbaum, chairman of General Growth Properties, died, she moved to Aspen and then to New York, where she met and married Robert I. Goldman, who died in 1998. Besides her husband, Mr. Learsy, survivors include her sons, Gene and Glenn Bucksbaum; her daughter, Mary Bucksbaum Scanlan; her stepchildren, Bill and Peter Lese and Olexa Mandelbaum; seven grandchildren; and six stepgrandchildren.
travel,On the Cigar Trail in Cuba - The New York Times Walking along the gritty, darkening streets of Havana, I felt a sense of foreboding wash over me. A few paces ahead was a stranger. Jorge, he called himself, a young street hustler I had just met at a taxi stand outside the Hotel Capri. Jorge was dressed decidedly urban: an oversize San Diego Padres jersey, baggy denim shorts and Adidas shell-toe sneakers. Jorge was also charming, and through broken English he had enticed me from the touristy environs of downtown into what was eerily morphing into a barren, crumbling neighborhood of sagging rowhouses. The object of seduction: a box of Habanos, or hand-rolled cigars. It was my first night in Havana, a trip prompted by thawing relations between the United States and Cuba. A few months before, in late December, President Obama had ordered the restoration of full diplomatic relations, setting in motion plans to open an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half-century. As nightfall quickened, my sense of vulnerability was heightened by the clop-clop of my sandals on the cobblestone streets. It seemed too late to start chastising myself for being a naïve American tourist dumb enough to be coaxed into the night for a few stogies. Ahead of me, Jorge, looking more sinister by the second, waved me on. Moving deeper into the Havana ’hood, I was, it seemed, at God’s mercy now — in a country noted, incidentally, for its dearth of churches and religion (despite the island’s warm reception of Pope Francis recently).
travel,Soon we reached a dilapidated brick building in the central neighborhood of Vedado. “Here, my friend!” Jorge said. “Good price here on Montecristo, and Cohiba, too!” Jorge rang a doorbell. A window two flights up opened, and keys dropped to the ground. He led me up a dim stairwell to an open apartment door, where we were greeted by a shirtless guy and an elderly woman who spirited me into a back room. And there it was on a wooden table, its lid majestically open: a box of Cuban Montecristo No. 2s. For the uninitiated, let me shed light on this treasure trove. Celebrated for its complex blend of creamy and spicy aromas, the Montecristo No. 2 is arguably the Cadillac of Cuban cigars; highly prized among aficionados and a rare find for the likes of me or any other occasional cigar-smoking American. I stepped over to admire the 25 torpedo-shaped beauties, light brown in hue and just over six inches long, each adorned with a chocolate-brown band emblazoned with a white sword insignia. Montecristo No. 2, the name inspired by the Alexandre Dumas novel, had long been among my favorites, rare enough that I couldn’t remember the last time I smoked one. “Gracias,” I told the woman, who shot me a weary smile as she wrapped my bounty in newspaper. I knew the price, 80 CUC (convertible Cuban pesos, priced to the American dollar), would spark envy in buddies back home accustomed to paying upward of $350 on the black market for a box of these gems. “You happy, my friend?” Jorge asked. I shook his hand, then hugged him as if he were family.
travel,Fifty-three years have passed since President John F. Kennedy enacted the Cuban trade embargo, ushering in a Dark Ages for American cigar enthusiasts. What’s less known, though, is that before imposing these historic sanctions on all Cuban products, the president called his press secretary at the time, Pierre Salinger, and asked him to secure “a lot of cigars,” Mr. Salinger recounted in 1992 in Cigar Aficionado magazine. As it happened, it wasn’t until the following morning, when Mr. Salinger informed the president that he had, in fact, scored 1,200 petite H. Upmanns (named after Herman Upmann, a German banker who opened a branch in Havana in the mid-1800s to send cigars home to Europe), that Kennedy signed the decree. For the average American cigar lover, Cuban smokes have remained mostly the rare indulgence; a celebratory spoil procured through mysterious back channels and offered when babies or businesses are born. Yet suddenly, the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba last July brought with it the prospect of a cigar renaissance; opening a path for ordinary Americans to visit and bring back, for now at least, $100 worth of Cuban cigars from tobacco’s Holy Grail.
travel,The eased sanctions put me in the mood to explore Cuba’s cigar culture, including the Alejandro Robaina Tobacco Plantation, arguably the most famous tobacco farm in the world. The home of the late farmer Alejandro Robaina, known as the face of the Cuban cigar, Robaina is tucked away in the town of San Luis in the Pinar del Río province, the most western section of Cuba. Founded in 1845, the farm is known for its robust yields of high-quality wrapper leaves; so impressive, in fact, that in the early 1980s Fidel Castro — a cigar-smoking Cohiba man himself — branded these cigars with the Robaina family name, the only Habanos to boast such a distinction. While Cuba can’t lay claim as the birthplace of cigars (historians give those bragging rights to farms in Guatemala), the island reigns as the world’s best producer of quality leaves, as celebrated as Napa and Bordeaux are by wine lovers. Traveling to Cuba is not generally the smoothest affair. I enjoyed the advantage of the Cuban embassy granting me permission to document this adventure as an official journalist. Most American cigar aficionados wanting to visit might find getting there quite difficult, since the law still does not allow Americans to travel to Cuba for tourism, but rather only for a dozen approved categories, which include religious and educational activities, professional research and humanitarian projects.
travel,For lodging in Havana I chose the Hotel Capri, a block from the Hotel Nacional, a favorite haunt of the notorious mobster Meyer Lansky, and near other famous cigar shops and rolling factories, as well as nightclubs flowing with Havana Club rum and Afro-Cuban music. The Capri, operated by the NH Hotel Group of Spain, also has Internet access, although the service was so spotty that I moved for my final night to a quieter, family-owned bed-and-breakfast, which turned out, in fact, to be decidedly lacking Internet access and other luxuries. Cigar smokers, actually smokers in general, enjoy rare freedom in Cuba, a carte blanche to light up in virtually any restaurant or bar, generally unheard of these days in North America and Europe. On my first evening, after a delicious seafood risotto on the balcony at the Café Laurent, a penthouse paladar (or privately owned restaurant) overlooking the Malecón, my waiter glanced at my newly acquired Montecristo No. 2 resting on the table. I planned to smoke it during a stroll afterward. Yet moments later, my cigar was cut — thanks to my hospitable waiter — and with its tip aglow, I gazed out at the Havana skyline. The view included the city’s tallest building, the state-owned Focsa, a towering commercial-residential structure, which at its base included a gigantic swimming pool with no water on this sweltering night.
travel,I savored the creamy aroma of my cigar, or puros, marveling at the perfection of the moment: the city lights and the rumba music wafting up from the streets. Even the non-cigar smoker must concede that a kind of Habanos romance swirls across this island. Cubans cherish cigars, literally. The works of the late Cuban poet Heberto Padilla have been compared to a great cigar: balanced, full flavored and serene. In the late 1960s, before Fidel Castro’s regime imprisoned and tortured the poet for criticizing Castro’s government, and before such intellectuals as Susan Sontag and Jean-Paul Sartre successfully campaigned for his release, Mr. Padilla had written, rather presciently: “General, I can’t destroy your fleets or your tanks/and I don’t know how long this war will last/but every night one of your orders dies without being followed/and, undefeated, one of my songs survives.” Such lyricism inspired the Padilla 1968 Golden Bear cigar, an earthy-flavored tribute to the poet. It’s called the 1968 Series because that’s the year Mr. Padilla published the anthology “Fuera del Juego” (“Out of the Game”), which ultimately got him locked up for “having plotted against the powers of the state.” Cigar novices might mistake this hard-to-find cigar band’s red and gold illustration for a crown, but aficionados know it’s actually the nib of the poet’s fountain pen.
travel,Cigar nostalgia abounds in Cuba, and I encountered few more eager to share it than Michael Phillips, a Briton who moved to Havana some 25 years ago to teach English. He is a devoted member of the city’s Cigar Aficionado Club, whose members — foreign diplomats and businessmen — meet monthly for dinner, cigars and conversation. Sitting in the spacious living room of his apartment in the upscale Miramar neighborhood, where most of the city’s top government officials reside, Mr. Phillips poured Cognac and held out a tray of unbanded cigars, from short coronas to lengthier Churchills, tan Habanos to darker Maduros. He grinned at my selection, pyramid-shaped and walnut in color. “Don’t ask me where it came from,” he said mischievously, “because I cannot tell you.” After some prodding, Mr. Phillips explained his suspiciously bandless cigar menu: “The rollers in the factory have a quota, but many of the women find a way to sneak a few extras out. So they roll for eight hours in the factory, and then come home and roll for another two hours.” He lit up, drew from his cigar, and watched the plume rise. “There was one girl who worked at the Romeo y Julieta factory; she was pregnant for three years!” He chuckled at such clever smuggling. “But yes, these are as good as the ones from the factory.”
travel,Cigar enthusiasts are a discriminating bunch, yet most agree that Cuba is blessed with a unique combination of sun, soil and moisture — coupled with a rich history of hand-rolling — that makes for the world’s most flavorful cigars, Mr. Phillips said. If there was a dark period, it occurred during the Communist revolution as some of Cuba’s most talented growers fled and set up operations in countries such as the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras and Nicaragua. While an infusion of Soviet cash helped to prop up Cuba’s cigar industry, competition over the next several decades from its new foreign rivals — along with some bad crop years and a dismal foray into tobacco hybridization — diminished its product. The complaints, ranging from poor flavor to shoddy construction, dragged Cuban cigars down in Cigar Aficionado magazine’s vaunted annual rankings. From 1998 to 2005, Cuban cigars never scored above an average 88 on a 100-point scale, compared with its typical 90-plus average in years beforehand. Such history is always surfacing here, a collision of old glory and modern reality that infuses even its architecture. On Tenerife Street in central Havana, for instance, is a former factory that was once a major production house and storage facility for cigars. Decades ago, the owners fled and passed the building down to remaining family members. A few years ago, though, city officials took note that there was, once again, a family living in the factory, and have since taken over the rest of it and renovated it with apartments. Former factory workers, who once lived in poor conditions, now reside free of charge in modern living quarters.
travel,In Cuba, those smoking the finest cigars tend to be visitors like me, expats like Mr. Phillips, senior government officials and international business people. Most Cubans living on a state salary of less than $20 a month can’t afford hand-rolled cigars of export quality. Cubans do smoke local cigars, but they are not good quality and cost about a nickel in American currency and can be fodder for swindling undiscerning tourists. The country’s economic hardship became clearer on a sunny morning during a drive to the Robaina plantation. I was traveling with a translator and two of her friends, erstwhile guides. For the two-hour trip, my guides had wisely traded in the hulking 1950s Chevrolet taxi we’d used in the city for a late-model Pontiac rental. As dense, boisterous Havana receded and the urban landscape turned into rolling green countryside, I saw another side of Cuba: rural and scattered with clapboard shanties and mules, donkeys and chickens, especially as we headed deeper into the region of Pinar del Río. There, one is reminded of the island’s poverty, even if it’s offset by a tight-knit culture where the sound of laughter and chatter envelops fruit stands displaying bananas and papaya. At one roadside stop, I treated myself to a 10-cent cigar and a cookie stuffed with guava jam.
travel,Tucked away on a narrow dirt road, the farm is easy for tourists to miss but for a modest hand-painted sign “Finca El Pinar Robaina” posted off the main one-lane drag. A mile or so along the road, the landscape turns into a bright green panorama of tobacco plants rustling in the breeze and stretching out infinitely in well-manicured rows. During growing season, from October through February, the plants can grow as high as 50 inches. Yanelis Delgado, a longtime neighbor and family friend in her early 40s, greeted me and began spinning yarns about Alejandro Robaina, the plantation’s founder, who died at 91 in 2010. For the next couple of hours, we walked around the 170-year-old property and Ms. Delgado shared stories, including how Mr. Robaina, who smoked his first cigar at age 10, took the reins of the operation after his father died in 1950. On a terrace adorned with flags representing the countries of visitors to the farm over the years is a life-size carving of Mr. Robaina sitting in a rocker gazing across the field. The memorabilia on display includes photos of world leaders and celebrity guests at the farm, and a handwritten note of encouragement (translated: “Hirochi, you are my future. Don’t disappoint me”) from Alejandro to his grandson, Hirochi Robaina, who now owns the farm.
travel,As one of Cuba’s few independent growers — most farms belong to cooperatives — the Robaina plantation became known for his growing techniques, which became synonymous with such premium brands as Cohiba and Hoyo de Monterrey. His tight relations with senior government officials — including both Cuban presidents Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl — led to the government creating one of the island’s 27 brands in his honor. To be sure, the brand is not as renowned as, say, Partagás and Romeo y Julieta, and cigar smokers have in recent years criticized the company for inconsistent quality as it struggled to meet rising demand that came from Castro’s homage to the farm. Cigarmaking is intricate, and success is governed mostly by timing, temperature and the artistry of human hands. It takes nearly two years for a cigar to move from nursery to rolling factory, Ms. Delgado explained. In the nursery, seeds are planted for germination and then a month later replanted as seedlings. In the roughly 45 days after the replanting, growers irrigate and treat the plants for pests. Once the leaves are brought into the drying or curing barn, they are strung with thread and hung from high ceilings. “It’s like a cathedral for tobacco,” Ms. Delgado said of the wooden barn, sun-bleached white with red shutters.
travel,The drying process lasts 50 days, during which the leaves change from green to yellow to brown. The thread is cut and the leaves are bundled, placed in piles and covered with a net for some 40 days at 100 degrees or more to spur fermentation, which determines the concentration of nicotine in leaves, flavor, aroma and texture. In the curing barn I watched a farm veteran lay out leaves and, within minutes, construct a flawless cigar, which he handed to me. The farm sells 90 percent of its product to the Cuban state-run cigar company, S.A. Habanos. Serious cigar smokers wax poetic with the language of wine aficionados, referring to a cigar’s flavor as “spicy” or “creamy” with hints of “honey,” “cocoa” and “cinnamon.” Cuba’s tobacco farmers take fierce pride in producing the most flavorful cigars in the world. Their nemesis is the expanding market not only for Cuban knockoffs but also for iconic Cuban brands whose leaves and labor are actually from other parts of the world, partly as a result of fleeing growers restarting their businesses elsewhere. For instance, the premium brand Cohiba, created exclusively in the mid-1960s for Castro and other senior government officials, has been embroiled in litigation for years as Habanos S.A. has contested the right of an American firm, the General Cigar Company, which manufactures Cohibas in the Dominican Republic, to sell under the Cohiba brand. As one senior manager at TabaCuba, the state agency that runs Cuba’s tobacco production and research, told me: “A Cuban cigar must be made with Cuban sun, Cuban soil, with Cuban hands. If not, there are no properties that make it what it claims to be.”
travel,It’s estimated that some five to eight million Cuban cigars reach Americans each year by way of countries like Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Mexico. Most experts agree that eased trade sanctions are far from opening a retail gateway between the United States and Cuba. It will take years, they say, for sellers to clear the byzantine network of international politics, trademark restrictions and F.D.A. regulations. When Cuban cigars finally do arrive abundantly — and legally — on American soil, most experts figure it will be through the Casa del Habano, Cuba’s state-owned chain of cigar boutiques, which already has some 130 stores worldwide. Cuban cigar culture, of course, can’t be exported. On my final day in Havana I came across the Hotel Conde de Villanueva, billed as the world’s only hostel dedicated to cigars. In the atrium, peacocks strutted as a “torcedor” rolled cigars for guests. Each of the nine guest rooms is named after a tobacco farm. A gorgeously restored 18th-century mansion adorned with stained-glass windows, the hotel also has an excellent cigar shop, plus an intimate smokers lounge. Gracing one wall are photographs of celebrities smoking cigars (among them, Demi Moore, Denzel Washington, Groucho Marx, Ernest Hemingway, Winston Churchill and Sigmund Freud). The hotel is surrounded by shops selling everything from chocolate to perfume. The atmosphere didn’t feel exactly authentic, so I walked a couple blocks away, deeper into Old Havana, and found a quiet seat beneath a canopied outdoor bar. It was a perfect spot to relax, to enjoy the distant sound of rumba and the view of vintage cars moving along the streets. I ordered a mojito. And then I lit my last cigar in Cuba.

science,Cats Are Birds’ No. 1 Enemy, Study Says - The New York Times While public attention has focused on wind turbines as a menace to birds, a new study shows that a far greater threat may be posed by a more familiar antagonist: the pet house cat. A new study in The Journal of Ornithology on the mortality of baby gray catbirds in the Washington suburbs found that cats were the No. 1 killer in the area, by a large margin. Nearly 80 percent of the birds were killed by predators, and cats were responsible for 47 percent of those deaths, according to the researchers, from the Smithsonian Institution and Towson University in Maryland. Death rates were particularly high in neighborhoods with large cat populations. Predation was so serious in some areas that the catbirds could not replace their numbers for the next generation, according to the researchers, who affixed tiny radio transmitters to the birds to follow them. It is the first scientific study to calculate what fraction of bird deaths during the vulnerable fledgling stage can be attributed to cats. “Cats are way up there in terms of threats to birds — they are a formidable force in driving out native species,” said Peter Marra of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, one of the authors of the study.
science,The American Bird Conservancy estimates that up to 500 million birds are killed each year by cats — about half by pets and half by feral felines. “I hope we can now stop minimizing and trivializing the impacts that outdoor cats have on the environment and start addressing the serious problem of cat predation,” said Darin Schroeder, the group’s vice president for conservation advocacy. By contrast, 440,000 birds are killed by wind turbines each year, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, although that number is expected to exceed one million by 2030 as the number of wind farms grows to meet increased demand. The American Bird Conservancy generally supports the development of wind energy, but it argues that wind farms should be “bird smart” — for example, positioned so that they do not interfere with major migration paths or disturb breeding grounds, with their power lines buried to prevent collisions. “I’m excited about wind; we just have to be careful where and how we put the turbines,” said Dr. Marra, who studies threats to birds, including from climate change and habitat loss. He said the leading cause of bird deaths over all, as opposed to the catbird fledglings in the study, remained collisions with buildings, windows and towers, followed by predators. Yet wind turbines often provoke greater outrage than cats do, said Gavin Shire, vice president of the Bird Conservancy. “The idea of a man-made machine chopping a bird in half creates a visceral reaction,” he said, “while the idea of a predator with its prey in its mouth — well we’ve seen that on the Nature Channel. People’s reaction is that it is normal for cats to kill birds.”
science,Household cats were introduced in North America by European colonists; they are regarded as an invasive species and have few natural enemies to check their numbers. “They are like gypsy moths and kudzu — they cause major ecological disruption,” Dr. Marra said.

health,Study Shows Spread of Cigarettes in China - The New York Times Chinese men now smoke one-third of all the world’s cigarettes, and a third of all young men in China are doomed to eventually die from the habit, scientists in China and Britain have concluded. Their study, published last week in The Lancet, estimated that two-thirds of all males in China smoked, more were still taking up the habit and more were starting as teenagers, which adds risk. With population growth stagnant, the number of men 60 or older is expected to double by 2030, and the number dying of smoking-related ailments each year will triple, hitting three million a year by 2050. More smokers are stopping by choice, the study found, but still only 9 percent did so. By contrast, smoking rates among women in China have dropped sharply; about 10 percent of older women smoke, but only about 1 percent of middle-aged women do. However, another recent study detected rapid increases among teenage girls in some regions. Before China achieved prosperity, the Lancet study said, smokers typically started at age 25, more smoked pipes and many could not afford multiple cigarettes every day. The study estimated future smoking-related deaths from many causes, including lung cancer, obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, heart failure and other cancers. Lung disease rates are already high in China, even among nonsmokers, owing to urban air pollution and to indoor wood fires used by the rural poor.
health,The study was led by scientists from China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the University of Oxford. Antismoking efforts in China face a difficult political situation: The central government has a monopoly through the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation, and more than 7 percent of government revenue comes from it. According to an editorial accompanying the study, myths about smoking persist in China: that Asians are less susceptible to its dangers, that it is an ancient Chinese tradition and that quitting is easy.

business/economy,Consumers Surprise Economists by Zipping Wallets in July - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Retail sales were unexpectedly flat in July as Americans cut back on discretionary spending, pointing to a moderation in consumption that could temper expectations for stronger economic growth. Other data on Friday showed that producer prices recorded their biggest drop in nearly a year in July as a result of declining costs for services and energy goods. Cooling consumer spending and tame inflation suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates anytime soon despite a robust labor market. “Fed members are afraid to come out from under their rocks until growth is sustainably solid and inflation in, near or at their target, and today’s reports don’t provide them with any comfort that will happen soon,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. Retail sales were unchanged in July, coming off a revised 0.8 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department said. Retail sales in June were previously reported to have increased 0.6 percent. Sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Motor vehicle sales increased 1.1 percent last month. Rising demand for autos is pulling spending away from discretionary items. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services — so-called core retail sales — were also unchanged last month after rising 0.5 percent in June. This figure corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
business/economy,Economists had forecast overall retail sales rising 0.4 percent and core sales climbing 0.3 percent last month. Some cautioned against reading too much into the July data, citing a labor market that is at or near full employment. “You have had two months of very strong job growth. It just seems very odd that spending would be weak. I will wait for the revisions before declaring July retail spending means anything more than random volatility,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York. There was another jump in online sales last month as they continued to grab market share from traditional retailers. Macy’s said on Thursday it would close an additional 100 stores as it tries to turn around its business after six quarters of falling sales. Like other department stores, Macy’s has been squeezed by stiff competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com. Separately, the Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for final demand dropped 0.4 percent last month, the first decline since March and the largest since September 2015. It increased 0.5 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, the P.P.I. slipped 0.2 percent. That was the biggest drop since December 2015 and followed a 0.3 percent increase in the 12 months through June. A strong dollar and cheaper oil continue to keep price pressures muted, leaving inflation running persistently below the Fed’s 2 percent target. Fed officials have repeatedly expressed concern about low inflation.
business/economy,A third report showed consumer sentiment was stable in early August, though households had a softer outlook on income. Most of the weakness was among younger households who cited higher expenses than anticipated, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment survey.
movies,‘Daddy’s Home 2’ and ‘Orient Express’ Turn Out Older Crowds - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — Score two for old-fashioned star power. A pair of new wide-release movies, “Daddy’s Home 2” and “Murder on the Orient Express,” both of which rely on starry ensembles, arrived to stronger-than-expected ticket sales in North American theaters over the weekend. Although neither could topple “Thor: Ragnarok,” which remained No. 1 for a second week, the sturdy results for “Daddy’s Home 2” and “Murder on the Orient Express” gave Hollywood hope that its formulas may not be as broken as many had started to believe. “Thor: Ragnarok” (Walt Disney Studios) collected an estimated $56.6 million, for a two-week domestic total of $211.6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Disney said the Marvel-branded superhero movie has now taken in $650.1 million worldwide. Second place went to “Daddy’s Home 2,” which took in about $30 million, or roughly 20 percent more than analysts had expected before release. On the downside, the PG-13 comedy was expensive, costing about $70 million to produce. “Daddy’s Home 2,” starring Mark Wahlberg, Mel Gibson, Will Ferrell and John Lithgow, received poor reviews but clicked with audiences, who gave it an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. More than 50 percent of the audience was over age 35. Even so, it will take much more than one box office win to stabilize Paramount, which has suffered a string of misfires, including “Suburbicon,” “Mother!,” “Monster Trucks” and “Baywatch.” Last week, the studio, which ranks last among Hollywood’s major studios in domestic market share, parted ways with its marketing and distribution chief.
movies,A glossy remake of “Murder on the Orient Express” (20th Century Fox) was third, with ticket sales of about $28.2 million, or 30 percent more than analysts had expected. “Murder on the Orient Express,” starring and directed by Kenneth Branagh, who was joined on screen by Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, Daisy Ridley and others, received mixed reviews and a B grade in CinemaScore exit polls. Fox said that 35 percent of the audience was over 35. Mr. Branagh’s movie collected an additional $45.8 million overseas. The film cost at least $55 million to produce. Also of note: Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” (A24), which has received rave reviews, making it a strong candidate for Oscar attention, collected $1.2 million in just 37 theaters, for a two-week total of $1.8 million — outperforming early results for awards-season hits like “Spotlight” in 2015 and “Birdman” in 2014. “Lady Bird” will arrive in more theaters next weekend. Playing on four screens, “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” (Fox Searchlight), another Oscar candidate, took in a stout $320,000.
business/media,Opposition and a Shave: Former Obama Aides Counter Trump - The New York Times AUSTIN, Tex. — The cultural-political revolution of the Nixon era was neither televised nor sponsored. If you listen to the coolest protest anthem ever, “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,” by Gil Scott-Heron, you’ll hear that it was not “brought to you by Xerox,” did not “go better with Coke,” did not have stars like Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen or the entertainment value of “Green Acres.” The Trump era’s #Resistance is flipping all of that on its head. It’s being televised, podcasted, hashtagged, Snapped, Facebooked, Twittered and Periscoped. It doesn’t yet go better with Coke. But it does go better with a good night’s sleep in Parachute sheets, a slick new web page designed with Squarespace and an affordable shave with Harry’s razors — bearded Bernie bros notwithstanding. Just go check out an episode of “Pod Save America,” one of the big breakout hits of the nascent resistance movement. Running twice weekly, it has all of the above-named brands and sponsors, stars several members of former President Barack Obama’s inner circle and seeks to entertain as much as it tries to inspire anti-Trump action. It regularly sits near the top of the iTunes list of most popular podcasts, riding the same indefatigable Trump clicks-and-ratings tiger that has propelled Stephen Colbert ahead of Jimmy Fallon, sent Rachel Maddow to viewership records and, from the opposite perspective, made Breitbart a household name.
business/media,It’s making so much money from advertising that one of its founders, the former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett, joked that he didn’t understand all the whining about how hard it is to make money in media. “It’s easy,” he said during an interview with the Recode co-founder Kara Swisher at the South by Southwest festival here last week. “Just start talking and money rolls in.” There’s something happening here, and to get clear on exactly what it was, I met up with the members of the “Pod Save America” crew while we were all in Austin. I caught them at the Driskill Bar, in the hotel where the Texas Rangers plotted the ambush of Bonnie and Clyde, where Lyndon Baines Johnson rang in his Senate and presidential victories, and where George W. Bush put together his cabinet. They were in the middle of gaming out how to build ever bigger audiences for the four shows they now offer under the banner of their brand-new company, Crooked Media, named after a favorite term of President Trump. There to help them was Tanya I. Somanader, who helped direct Obama White House efforts to get its message in front of different audiences online. (They are hoping to recruit her full time.) It’s only fitting that Mr. Lovett and his co-founders — Mr. Obama’s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, and the former national security spokesman Tommy Vietor — should be part of the anti-Trump resistance.
business/media,They were co-authors of Mr. Obama’s 2011 speech at the White House Correspondents Association dinner that lampooned Mr. Trump so harshly that it helped form his decision to make a real presidential bid, I’ll-show-’em style. (The speech depicted him as a moon-landing truther and ended with eerie prescience: “He certainly would bring some change to the White House.”) “It was probably the first time all three of us worked on something together,” Mr. Favreau told me. “A speech that will live in infamy,” Mr. Vietor lamented. All three were in California — Mr. Lovett writing for television and Mr. Vietor and Mr. Favreau running a consulting business — when the campaign started. Itching to play some small role, they joined with another Obama colleague, Dan Pfeiffer, and started a podcast called “Keepin’ It 1600” for the sports, entertainment and news site The Ringer. They initially saw it as little more than a sideline, even as it steadily built an audience. Then came Nov. 8. Their podcast audience spiked to 400,000 the next day. But, more important, they wanted to make some sort of bigger return to the fray. “I had a really fun career in TV right after I left politics,” said Mr. Lovett, who abandoned the White House in late 2011 for Hollywood, where he developed the comedy “1600 Penn” and wrote for HBO’s “The Newsroom.” “But I’d be lying if I didn’t say that over the year of the election I didn’t feel that I wanted more purpose.”
business/media,But here’s where we take our turn into the great beyond of 2017. If this were 10 years ago, they would have most likely returned to the Democratic Party structure. Maybe they’d have started a “super PAC” or joined MoveOn. Perhaps they’d blog for Daily Kos. Direct political combat would have come in the form of television and Web ads. But now politics are being waged as infotainment — and all too often, mis-infotainment. Mr. Trump won the presidency by turning his campaign into a prodigious content studio. It pumped out programming that obliterated all opposing messages in its path, across all media. For news organizations, it was a traffic, ratings — and therefore ad-revenue — bonanza. His White House is running much the same way — operating less in the real world of actual intelligence reports, solid data and expert analyses, and more in the media sphere’s mix of hard facts, rumor and wild conspiracy theory. Just look at last week, when an unsubstantiated report that President Obama enlisted British intelligence to eavesdrop on the incoming Trump administration, shared on Fox News, caused an international incident. What a riveting show! (Now what was that thing about the immigration order’s being blocked in court again?) So as the Crooked Media guys set out to counter Mr. Trump, they realized that they were already on the right track with their podcast. They were going to have to meet him on the terrain that he was quickly overdeveloping. You don’t start a super PAC, you start a show; you counterprogram.
business/media,“The fusion of media and politics now — and media as a platform for politicians and for movements — is something that we’ve never seen before, because that’s where people are,” Mr. Favreau told me. Mr. Trump’s tendency to “come up with nicknames for his opponents, float conspiracy theories,” works for him, Mr. Favreau said, “because he wins when more people are cynical about politics and politicians.” “Our job,’’ he added, “is to give people a reason to believe and participate in politics, which means our version of entertainment can’t be as frivolous or nasty or dishonest.” So they set out to mix jokes with insider descriptions of executive branch norms and interviews, often with people who can recommend political action — a protest, a phone-call campaign, an organizing drive — which is the sort of thing mainstream news media can’t do because, as Mr. Favreau said, “it would be picking a side.” With episodes being downloaded up to 1.4 million times, according to data they shared from their hosting platform, ART19, they tapped into “a wave of interest about this president, a lot of it based on fear,” Mr. Favreau said. It turned out they were joining a hit program already in progress — what with booming ratings for Ms. Maddow on MSNBC and, for that matter, Mr. Colbert’s “Late Show” on CBS. As those shows have surged, Crooked Media found advertisers — once scared away as a class from overt politics — that were now ready to dive in and throw money at them. (Nothing pushes advertisers to ditch their caution like a hit show.)
business/media,Crooked Media wouldn’t divulge dollar figures. But it said it had generated enough revenue to build out its programming slate without investors. When I asked the founders if they thought it was a “media company,” Mr. Favreau said, “I don’t know if it’s a political movement or a media company.” Mr. Vietor added, “We’re going to maximize for the political impact, not the financial impact.” These days, they can be one and the same. So this is what’s happening here: The political war is a media content war — one where profit and mission, entertainment value, and consequential policy debates combine to make for the most-watched, clicked and sponsored political programming in modern history. You’d think Gil Scott-Heron would be shocked. But his biographer Marcus Baram told me he might actually be heartened. His poem was actually about not being a passive-resistance media consumer. This current show is decidedly interactive. Somebody get me a Coke.
arts/dance,Jawole Willa Jo Zollar’s ‘Black Jam’ at Danspace Project - The New York Times The progressive contemporary dance scene in New York can be an intensely hermetic world. This is sometimes for good, creating a certain freedom to push into the unknown. But often (and as is the case in many other art world pockets) it is for ill. Sealed off from outside influences, an echo chamber effect takes hold. So it has been heartening in recent months to see Danspace Project becoming something of a melting pot, with guest curators in the Platform series mashing together different traditions and generations and audiences in thoughtful and surprising ways. A framework like Parallels, a program designed by the choreographer and guest curator Ishmael Houston-Jones to interrogate the notion of black dance, could lend itself to another form of hermeticism. But Thursday night, when Jawole Willa Jo Zollar presented her “Black Jam” at the invitation of Mr. Houston-Jones, a deliciously open spirit suffused St. Mark’s Church. In introducing the evening Ms. Zollar spoke of the ways in which improvisation has undergirded the black dance vernacular and of her early personal history with it. (Her mother, a jazz singer and pianist, took her to jam sessions as a child in Kansas City, Mo.) She wanted, she said, to create, with “Black Jam,” a house party, in which the artists’ “process was not hidden,” and the audience feels involved.
arts/dance,And so, the house party began with a house band of sorts: the dancers Hunter Carter, Samantha Speis and Marya Wethers , their finely tuned bodies moving throughout the space in a hinging, buckling fluid scrum. (This followed a brief video prelude featuring Mr. Houston-Jones and Fred Holland performing in much the same way at Danspace in 1983). It’s no easy thing to protect yourself and your partners in unpredictable contact improvisations like this, while also building something that people will want to watch. These three were bewitching, especially Ms. Wethers, an eloquent dancer whose fierce intelligence is cut by a quiet humor. Ms. Zollar at this point was playing M.C. Soon enough she was center stage, laughing as she invited her fellow “old-timers” to join her for an improvisation both quirky and moving. There is always something magical in seeing luminaries engaged in high silliness, and this lineup was impressive: Ms. Zollar, Mr. Houston-Jones, Blondell Cummings, Cynthia Oliver and Bebe Miller, in a leg brace, no less. “I’m the pity vote,” she said. (Fat chance. The audience appeared enraptured.) Their gamboling flowed into a task-based improvisation for the house band: Ms. Zollar, wielding a stopwatch, gave the three dancers increasingly short segments of time to cut a diagonal across the stage. True to her contemporary dance roots, she ended the exercise only when they encountered failure.
arts/dance,“Black Jam” was a voluptuously, sensually satisfying experience; it was enough, in some ways, just to sink into what it offered. But Ms. Zollar made her intellectual points too, about the varied cultures and traditions that have long fed her as an artist. The final somewhat formal segment of the evening (before an open dance jam) provided a too-brief taste of house dance by Monstah Black, Brian Polite and Kendra Ross. Here you could see a larger social and political history, compressed into a gloriously diverse form. And you could see it in conversation with contemporary dance, with black dance, with New York: the world rushed in through the open windows.
world/africa,Kenyatta Is Declared the Victor in Kenya, but Opponent Plans to Appeal - The New York Times NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya’s election commission on Saturday declared Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya’s first president and one of the prime suspects in a case involving crimes against humanity, to be the winner of the country’s presidential race amid growing allegations of vote fraud and a refusal by the other leading contender to concede. Mr. Kenyatta, who has been accused by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague of bankrolling death squads during Kenya’s last election crisis, cleared the 50 percent threshold and avoided a runoff by the thinnest of margins, about 8,000 votes out of 12 million, or .07 percent. Mr. Kenyatta’s trial is set for July, which means that Kenya, one of the United States’ closest allies in Africa, could soon have a president commuting back and forth from The Hague, simultaneously trying to run a country and keep himself out of jail. Mr. Kenyatta has said that he is innocent and that he will cooperate with the court, but in his acceptance speech on Saturday he signaled that he wanted the world to back off. “We recognize and accept our international obligations,” he said. “However, we also expect that the international community will respect the sovereignty and the democratic will of the people of Kenya.”
world/africa,But it was not completely clear what the will of the people really was. The second-place finisher, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s prime minister, has refused to admit defeat and plans to appeal to Kenya’s Supreme Court to overturn the results, which some independent observers said were sloppy and suspicious. Mr. Odinga said there had been “rampant illegality” and “massive tampering” with the vote-tallying process, the same problem that bedeviled Kenya’s last election in 2007. Mr. Odinga narrowly lost that race and after he protested, Kenya exploded in political violence. “We thought this would never happen again,” he said, referring to the fraud allegations. But he urged his supporters to stay calm. “We don’t want riots, property damage or any other kind of disturbance,” Mr. Odinga said. “Any violence now could destroy this nation forever.” Some of Mr. Odinga’s strongholds, like the sprawling Kibera slum, were tense on Saturday. Police officers prowled the streets as groups of young men glared at television sets, many still visibly dumbfounded by the election results, but there were no reports of major violence. Mr. Kenyatta’s victory, after a heated race, poses unique challenges for the Obama administration, which increasingly relies on Kenya as a partner in a volatile region, yet, at the same time, has pledged to support the International Criminal Court, though the United States is not a member.
world/africa,In the weeks before the election, the American top official for Africa issued a thinly veiled warning that “choices have consequences” and some Western diplomats here indicated that they would keep their distance from Mr. Kenyatta, currently a deputy prime minister, should he win. The next few months and perhaps even years will be an awkward time for United States-Kenya relations, analysts said, an unexpected turn of events, considering that Kenya was the birthplace of President Obama’s father and a place Mr. Obama has written fondly about. The International Criminal Court — and the perception that Western countries were lining up against Mr. Kenyatta — seems to have been a galvanizing factor in this election, driving a wave of Mr. Kenyatta’s supporters to the polls. In some constituencies, especially in the areas of his Kikuyu ethnic group, he won 98 percent of the vote. “Kenyans may be tribalists but we are also nationalists,” said Edward Kirathe, a real estate developer and a passionate Kenyatta supporter. “If someone from the outside tells you not to select someone, then that is the person you go and select.” Mr. Kenyatta’s running mate, William Ruto, one of Kenya’s most charismatic politicians, has also been charged by the International Criminal Court with crimes against humanity. Mr. Ruto, who is expected to be the deputy president, is accused of sponsoring gangs of young men who hunted down supporters of his political opponents in 2007 and early 2008. This election was especially polarizing, and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, was split between equal measures of jubilation and grief.
world/africa,On River Road, in downtown Nairobi, pickup trucks chugged through the streets, loaded with Kenyatta supporters draped in red — Mr. Kenyatta’s campaign color. They blew horns, danced joyous jigs and shouted “amani!” or peace, while police trucks crawled slowly behind them. In Uhuru Park (uhuru means freedom in Swahili, which is how Mr. Kenyatta got his name, because he was born shortly before Kenya’s independence in 1963), ecstatic supporters waved freshly chopped branches, turning a parade ground into a sea of piney-smelling green. But the mood could not have been more different in Kibera, where thousands of Odinga loyalists live in sheet-metal shacks. Many young men were huddled on the street corners, simmering with disappointment and anger. “This was rigged,” said Fred Okech, a math teacher. In one part of the slum, residents said shouting matches erupted between supporters of Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga. “There’s tension,” said Jacob Otieno, a college student. “I think there might be clashes because this was not fair.” Police officers set up checkpoints all around the slum, stopping cars, peering into trunks and looking for weapons, while a helicopter circled overhead. This election was always expected to be close. Polls had showed Mr. Odinga, 68, and Mr. Kenyatta, 51, neck and neck. Both won many fans outside their ethnic groups (Mr. Odinga is a Luo) but much of their support came from ethnic strongholds where in some places nearly every single voter voted as part of a bloc for the favored candidate.
world/africa,Mr. Kenyatta’s vast family fortune, estimated to be around $500 million, definitely helped, with so many parts of Nairobi and smaller towns literally painted red with campaign posters. The Kenyatta wealth began with Mr. Kenyatta’s father, Jomo, who as president appropriated hundreds of thousands of prime land, planting deep grievances among other ethnic groups. But Mr. Odinga is no pauper either. His father, Jaramogi, was Kenya’s first vice president, and the Odingas have vast holdings, too. On election day, this past Monday, millions of voters flooded into polling places, some waiting 10 hours in line, with no food or drink. Most observers said the voting itself went fine. But problems began to crop up soon afterward and the new vote transmission system, in which results were supposed to be relayed via encrypted text messages, crashed. The election commission then spent the next four days tabulating results manually, which spawned conspiracy theories and paralyzed this country, because many Kenyans stayed at home, away from school and work, anxiously awaiting the outcome. After the election commission declared Mr. Kenyatta the winner, the American government issued a statement congratulating “the people of Kenya for voting peacefully” but, pointedly enough, making no mention of the president-elect. Mr. Kenyatta, a graduate of Amherst College and a smooth, confident speaker, said that Kenya had surpassed all expectations. “We dutifully turned out, we voted in peace, we upheld order,” he said. “That, ladies and gentleman,” he emphasized, “is the real victory.”

business,Burning Coal at Home Is Making a Comeback - The New York Times SUGARLOAF, Pa. — Kyle Buck heaved open the door of a makeshift bin abutting his suburban ranch house. Staring at a two-ton pile of coal that was delivered by truck a few weeks ago, Mr. Buck worried aloud that it would not be enough to last the winter. “I think I’m going through it faster than I thought I would,” he said. Aptly, perhaps, for an era of hard times, coal is making a comeback as a home heating fuel. Problematic in some ways and difficult to handle, coal is nonetheless a cheap, plentiful, mined-in-America source of heat. And with the cost of heating oil and natural gas increasingly prone to spikes, some homeowners in the Northeast, pockets of the Midwest and even Alaska are deciding coal is worth the trouble. Burning coal at home was once commonplace, of course, but the practice had been declining for decades. Coal consumption for residential use hit a low of 258,000 tons in 2006 — then started to rise. It jumped 9 percent in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration, and 10 percent more in the first eight months of 2008. Online coal forums are buzzing with activity, as residential coal enthusiasts trade tips and advice for buying and tending to coal heaters. And manufacturers and dealers of coal-burning stoves say they have been deluged with orders — many placed when the price of heating oil jumped last summer — that they are struggling to fill.
business,“Back in the 1980s, we sold hundreds a year,” said Rich Kauffman, the sales manager at E.F.M. Automatic Heat in Emmaus, Pa., one of the oldest makers of coal-fired furnaces and boilers in the United States, in a nod to the uptick in coal sales that followed the oil crises of the 1970s. “But that dwindled to nothing in the early 1990s — down to as many as 10 a year,” he said. “It picked up about a year ago, when we moved about 60 units, and then this year we’ve already sold 200.” Dean Lehman, the plant manager for Hitzer Inc., a family-owned business in Berne, Ind., that makes smaller, indoor coal stoves, said his stoves were on back order until March. And Jeffery Gliem, the director of operations at the Reading Stove Company and its parent, Reading Anthracite, in Pottsville, Pa., which supplies coal and stoves to 15 states in the Northeast and Midwest, said the uptick in interest was the largest he had seen in 30 years. “In your typical year you might have five, six, seven thousand stoves being sold,” Mr. Gliem said. “This year it was probably double that.” The coal trend is consistent with steep increases in other forms of supplementary heating that people can use to save money — most of them less messy than coal. Home Depot reports that it has sold more than 80,000 tons of pellet fuel, a sort of compressed sawdust, for the season to date. That is an increase of 137 percent compared with the same period last year, said Jean Niemi, a company spokeswoman.
business,Coal may never make economic sense in areas far from where it is mined. But in places within reasonable delivery range, the price tends to be stable, compared with heating oil or natural gas. Prices for natural gas more than tripled in recent years before plunging in the last few months amid the downturn. Coals vary in quality, but on average, a ton of coal contains about as much potential heat as 146 gallons of heating oil or 20,000 cubic feet of natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration. A ton of anthracite, a particularly high grade of coal, can cost as little as $120 near mines in Pennsylvania. The equivalent amount of heating oil would cost roughly $380, based on the most recent prices in the state — and over $470 using prices from December 2007.  An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost about $480 at current prices. Mr. Buck said he could buy coal for $165 a ton. On a blustery afternoon recently, he was still studying the manual for his $2,300 Alaska Channing stoker, which gave off an intense heat in the den. An automated hopper in the back slowly dispensed fine anthracite coal chips into the stove’s belly, and every couple of days, Mr. Buck emptied the ash. He said he hoped the stove would cut his oil consumption in half.
business,“Now, somewhere, you’ve got to take into account the convenience of turning up your thermostat, versus having two tons of coal to shovel and the hopper and ashes to deal with,” Mr. Buck said. But if the $330 worth of coal in his makeshift bin “heats the house for the winter,” he added, “you can’t beat it.” Wesley Ridlington, a homeowner in Fairbanks, Alaska, bought an outdoor coal furnace for $13,000 in March and uses it as his main source for heat and hot water. On a recent evening, as the temperature hovered around 23 below zero, Mr. Ridlington worked to free up the rotating burning plate inside the furnace, which he figured was jammed by a pebble. He did not seem to mind the glitch, or, for that matter, loading the furnace twice a week and emptying the ash pan every night. “It takes a little bit of time,” he said, “but for the savings, it’s worth it.” Mr. Ridlington said he was typically burning 1,500 gallons of oil each winter to heat his 3,300-square-foot home. At last year’s prices, that would have cost about $7,000, he said. This winter, he expects to burn nine tons of coal at a cost of about $1,400. “The initial cost was expensive,” he said. “But in three to five years, it’ll be paid for, even with prices going down. And if fuel goes back up again, it’ll be even more savings.”
business,Rob Richards, who owns a business in Fairbanks that sells spas, pool tables, and now outdoor coal furnaces, said that when oil prices were higher, he could promise fuel cost savings of more than 75 percent and a payback of 18 months for an outdoor coal furnace. With oil prices down again, orders for furnaces have dropped off, and the savings are closer to 50 percent with a  few years’ time to recoup the cost, he said. “Still, you’re looking at a quick payback,” Mr. Richards added. Coal was a dominant source of heat for American homes for much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Americans were still burning more than 50 million tons for heating in 1950, according to the federal statistics. But coal, primarily used today in power plants and steelmaking, has not been used for heating on a large scale for decades. Cleaner and more easily distributed forms of heating fuel — including natural gas, electricity and oil — displaced coal, and residential use dropped precipitously, to 2.8 million tons by 1975, and then to less than 500,000 tons by 2000. Even with the recovery of the last couple of years, residential use of coal in the United States, at less than 300,000 tons today and representing a fraction of 1 percent of all coal use, is “not even a blip on the screen,” said Carol Raulston, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association.
business,Still, even amid the steep decline, small upticks similar to the current one have appeared from time to time, and residential use of coal never entirely went away. In Homer, Alaska, fall storms wash crude coal onto the beach from underwater deposits. In the mountains of eastern Kentucky or the hills of central Pennsylvania, residents can simply dig it out of the ground. “As long as people have been mining coal up there,” said John Hiett of Kentucky’s Office of Mine Safety and Licensing, “people have burned coal in their houses.” Government data suggest that about 131,000 households use coal as their primary source of heat, with perhaps 80,000 more using it as a secondary source. Those numbers are small enough that issues relating to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have remained largely off the radar. Burning coal does throw fine particles into the air that can pose problems for some people, similar to the problems involved in burning wood — though wood stoves and fireplace inserts are increasingly subject to regulation to cut down on pollutants. “Coal stoves don’t have that,” said James E. Houck, the president of Omni Environmental Services, a firm in Portland, Ore., that tests air quality. “And there’s no regulatory pressure for them to have it.” In some localities where residential coal burning is becoming a factor, that might be changing. In Fairbanks, air quality experts suspect the increase in coal burning — along with increased wood burning — is contributing to concentrations of fine particles well above federal limits.
business,“We see it as a real health hazard to Fairbanks,” said Jim Conner, the Fairbanks North Star Borough’s air quality specialist. Concerns like these have not deterred companies marketing coal. Back East, the Blaschak Coal Corporation, a midsize supplier of anthracite in Mahanoy City, Pa., still emblazons company trucks and baseball caps with images of Santa Claus lugging a sack of coal. “Everybody’s looking at wherever they can to save money,” said Daniel Blaschak,  a co-owner of the company. “ ’Cause guess what? We no longer have disposable income. We are up to our necks in debt. And there’s very few things we can’t live without, but heat is one of them.”

theater,David Harewood and Orlando Bloom on Shakespearean Warm-Ups - The New York Times Less than an hour before he was due to roar onto the stage on a motorcycle in “Romeo and Juliet,” Orlando Bloom strode along the gilded balcony of the Richard Rodgers Theater, contorting his mouth and making peculiar noises. “Imagine managing an imaginary menagerie,” he said so fast that the words blurred together, then repeated the tongue twister, more complex this time. He fluttered his lips like a horse, exhaling. In another empty balcony, at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, David Harewood was warming up before the start of Theater for a New Audience’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream.” He did situps and push-ups, ran in place, dashed along a row of seats. He flexed and uttered gibberish: “Mmm, aaaa. Mm, mm, zz, zz!” All this so that when Mr. Bloom took the stage as Romeo, and Mr. Harewood as Oberon, their bodies would be ready to meet the technical challenges of performing Shakespeare. Recently, Laura Collins-Hughes spoke with actors from this Shakespeare-rich season about the requirements, roadblocks and rewards — physical and mental — that come with doing his plays. These are excerpts from those conversations. Mastering the Lines BIANCA AMATO [Lady Macduff in Lincoln Center Theater’s “Macbeth”] Funnily enough, contemporary stuff takes me longer to learn than Shakespeare. I certainly do beat out the meter for fun, in the early stages. I can just walk around the room and beat on my thighs with my hand while I’m saying the line. I get that in my body, and then I can let it go because it’s in there.
theater,DAPHNE RUBIN-VEGA [Nurse in Classic Stage Company’s recent “Romeo and Juliet”] I’m just in love with Macklemore. The way he rapped was so helpful to me in terms of how to speak in poetry and how to roll it out. Of course, I didn’t just bust out rapping. The rap helped me with literal flow, the flow of words, and how words in and of themselves have a beat. DAVID HAREWOOD If you get an “and” wrong or an “if” wrong or an “as” wrong, just one little word, it puts the whole thing out. I still find myself reading the script every night.    Conquering the Fear ORLANDO BLOOM You can’t be afraid. And, of course, you are at times. Like, I mean, before the first preview. [The voice teacher] Patsy [Rodenburg] has said an actor’s emotional and physical experience of walking onto a stage for the first time performing Shakespeare in that first preview can be likened to going through a car crash. In terms of trauma, in terms of what that does to the body. Which is great, right? Sign right up. ERIC TUCKER [Hamlet in Bedlam Theater’s four-person “Hamlet”] It’s very difficult to go out there. You feel people have this notion of what Hamlet is or what they like, out of all the other Hamlets they’ve seen. You have to somehow kick that out of your mind and just say, ‘O.K., well, for tonight, I’m Hamlet, and this is the one they’re getting — like it or not.’ So you’re kind of up against history in a way.
theater,RUBIN-VEGA I think it’s a myth that Shakespeare is dauntingly hard. It requires attention, and I think that’s what we call hard. If we taught Shakespeare to kids as soon as they learned how to read, then in 20 years we would see how easy it is. Revving Up PETER HAMILTON DYER [Various roles in Shakespeare’s Globe’s “Twelfth Night” and “Richard III,” running in repertory on Broadway] We’re sort of playing an away game here. It’s an enormous privilege to come to New York and Broadway. But the necessity to focus and just make sure that one is not distracted by all of the marvelous things that you’re surrounded by becomes doubly important.  BLOOM It’s like being an athlete. A hundred-meter sprinter wouldn’t just sort of walk out of the changing room, stand on those blocks and take off. They’d stretch. In order to be able to really connect with the text, you need to be both vocally strong and at the same time relaxed. So it’s all about your breath, and then warming up the mouth: the tongue, the mouth, the respiratory system. You need to get it all kind of lubed up, in a way. HAREWOOD It takes an enormous amount of energy just to get through the evening. It’s incredibly dense language, but if you get it right — if you warm yourself up enough — it’s just such a joy to play. Just in terms of your face, to be that expressive takes a lot of mechanical dexterity. You have to get your brain in gear as well. If I’ve warmed up my body and I’ve warmed up my voice and I’ve warmed up technically, then all that technique gives me access to my imagination so that onstage, I can do anything.
theater,Winding Down HAMILTON DYER Between the shows, you’ll find most of the company end up having a little lie-down to clear their heads. BLOOM When I started, I was exhausted. I’ve never slept so deeply or so intensely. I consider myself to be quite athletic, quite physically fit, agile and so on. And I couldn’t sleep enough. TUCKER It’s really the voice that gets so ragged. You can’t go out after and sit in some loud place and have to talk over everybody. If a place is open really late it’s probably playing music and there are lines of 20-year-olds out the door, so you have to yell. HAREWOOD I’ll probably eat something after the show. I’ve actually been eating less — a lot more greens, a lot more healthy stuff, a lot more grains. Trying to cut out the burgers and the fast food. BLOOM It’s O.K. to have a drink but not to get drunk.

arts/design,Melvin the Mummy, Rewrapped, at Brooklyn Museum - The New York Times WHEN it comes to names for Egyptian mummies, there’s no question that Anonymous Man lacks the royal heft of, say, King Tutankhamun. Even the Anonymous Man’s nickname, Melvin, isn’t quite a head turner. Even so, as crowds swarm the mummy-less exhibition of treasures of the predictably famous King Tut at the Discovery Times Square Exposition, Melvin the Mummy has a good story to tell. The tale is noteworthy for his recent and innovative restoration — basically an extreme mummy makeover — and his harrowing and unlikely 1,700-year journey from ancient Egypt to  a 21st-century exhibition vitrine in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Museum is currently displaying Melvin for the first time since he entered its collection in 1952. He has been cleaned up, rewrapped and is stretched out beneath his boldly painted cartonnage, or decorative covering — he looks a bit like a Byzantine Jesus graced with Groucho Marx eyebrows — as part of “The Mummy Chamber.” The 170-work exhibition is dedicated to the   artifacts of the afterlife and is scheduled to be on long-term view. Melvin, however, almost didn’t make it to his latest star turn. After being excised from 14 layers of linen wrappings in 1956, as part of a treasure hunt for amulets and jewelry, he was almost consigned to an incinerator.
arts/design,But Melvin, given his nickname by the museum’s staff in the 1950s, escaped the flames in a near miss so dramatic that it inspired an hourlong teleplay that was broadcast on CBS in 1958. Then he was shut in storage for decades. Only his cartonnage was deemed worthy of display and study. But now he has been rewrapped, head to toe, in the original linen in which he was sent to the afterlife. It was an exacting process that, with study and research, took nearly a year. Repairing a swatch of ancient linen, or rewrapping a mummy in new material, are both accepted restoration practices. However, as Mimi Leveque, an independent conservator of antiquities, said, “there is no normal mummy procedure,” in part because mummification techniques varied over the centuries, and there just aren’t that many mummies being actively studied. But Melvin’s reswaddling in 1,700-year-old fabric is something new, mummy experts say. “Brooklyn is pioneering in this,” said Marie Svoboda, an associate conservator of antiquities at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. “That’s the first I’ve heard of such a rewrapping.” The Brooklyn Museum has one of the country’s best collections of Egyptian objects, and it includes nine mummies, which is considered a bounty of the dead and bandaged. Four of them are on display in “The Mummy Chamber,” including Melvin.
arts/design,“It was kind of nice, actually, putting his clothes back on — two little boat-neck tunics with cap sleeves,” Lisa Bruno, the Brooklyn’s Museum’s chief conservator, said of dressing Melvin more than 50 years after his clothes were removed and flung aside. Even his plant-fiber necklace survived in storage and was draped around his cartonnage once again. Putting his clothes back on was easy. Then came the linen, the traditional Egyptian mummification material since about 2400 B.C. When Ms. Bruno took on the project, she knew that she was lucky that Melvin had been entombed around A.D. 300, late in the mummification era, when Rome ruled Egypt. “Resins were poured inside his body to preserve it, but not on top of the body with the wrapping,” she said. “In earlier eras they also went on the linen, which became a brittle shell. If that had been done, there would be nothing left to rewrap him in.” Ms. Bruno compared Melvin’s coverings at the start of the project to “a giant sleeping bag with a cut up the middle.” The outer layer had been sliced and the other 13 peeled back. The mummy itself had become completely exposed in the intervening years. First, the conservators gently vacuumed the linens, because dust is rough and acidic. Then they studied the ancient creases to guide them in refolding the material over the body.
arts/design,Once he was again snug in his traveling clothes for the afterlife, a delicate sewing job was needed. The original bindings that held the layers in place, also made of linen, were beyond repair, so the staff members distressed pieces of new cotton and used them to replace the old ones. Conservators and curators from other institutions have taken note of the Brooklyn Museum’s approach. “They have been shocked, and not in a bad way, that we could reuse the linens,” Ms. Bruno said. Edward Bleiberg, the museum’s curator of Egyptian, classical and ancient Middle Eastern art, even went so far as to say that Ms. Bruno and the museum’s textile conservator, Kathy Francis, “probably know more about wrapping a Roman mummy than anyone since the third century.” Attending to a mummified man, though, is not without its squirm-inducing moments, even for veterans of the mummy wars. “Basically he’s turned into leather,” Mr. Bleiberg said of Melvin’s current state. Ms. Bruno added: “He was the most smelly of the mummies we worked on. And that’s probably because he had less resin. But he’s really only decomposing on a microlevel.” Melvin’s makeover is part of the effort to restore all nine of the Brooklyn Museum’s mummies. The museum had an inquiry from the Getty in 2006 about another Roman-era man in the collection, and “it got us thinking about studying our mummies in depth,” said Mr. Bleiberg, who organized “The Mummy Chamber.”
arts/design,Once museum staff members started giving the mummies a hard look, there was no lack of surprises. At one point four mummies were given CT scans. Before the scans they had always been classified as two women and two men. But it quickly became clear they were all men, including a mummy known as Hor (712-664 B.C.), who appears in the current exhibition. “The technician said, ‘I thought you said this was a woman,’ ” Mr. Bleiberg recalled. “And then he pointed to the unmistakable evidence to the contrary.” In Hor’s case the confusion arose because his pretty and hairless face led curators of the 1930s to assume he was a woman. The other newly reclassified male in the show, Thothirdes, had his name mistranslated from the hieroglyphics on his coffin,  despite the beard present in his depiction there. Another marquee object waiting in “The Mummy Chamber,” a book of the dead that was interred with an Egyptian jeweler named Sobekmose, was a victim of less evolved museum practices of an earlier time. The 25-foot-long scroll, one of the oldest and longest such books ever dug up, was  cut up  into smaller sections so that it could be studied more easily. An incident like that gives Mr. Bleiberg pause. He said he wonders what errors he and his staff members might be making today that would be mortifying 50 years from now. “I worry a lot,” he said. “But you can’t get frozen by that.”
arts/design,Those worries are why “reversibility” and “documentation” are crucial words among conservators of ancient objects today. Anything done to an object should be able to be undone easily, and museums chronicle each step of their work, as they did with Melvin. And Melvin, strangely enough, a now-anonymous upper-middle-class man who was buried near Luxor, Egypt, in a simple wooden coffin, has ended up being one of the best-known mummies about town. (Though it must be said that he’s still trumped by King Tut, who even had a song written about him by the comedian Steve Martin.) Brooklyn Museum staff members tweeted about Melvin as he was rewrapped this past winter. And he had the title role in  “The Complex Mummy Complex,” which was broadcast on “Armstrong Circle Theater” in 1958. Inspired by a newspaper article, the show relates how the mummy was kept from the incinerator by Anthony Giambolvo, a  devout  museum technician who wanted to save Melvin’s immortal soul. Mr. Giambolvo and the museum’s curator of Egyptian works then, John Cooney — the same man who had tried to cast Melvin aside — try and fail in several attempts to donate or bury  the body. The story is played for laughs, a kind of “Trouble With Harry” for Egyptologists. But at the end of the program, the real-life Mr. Cooney appears and humorlessly states that mummies “have no place in an art museum.” Poor Melvin. That attitude is in striking contrast to the one that is exemplified by the new “Mummy Chamber” and Melvin’s restoration.
arts/design,“When these mummies were altered and covered, they became artifacts,” Mr. Bleiberg said, adding that the museum would never show them uncovered. “We display the mummies, and we respect them.”
arts/design,China’s Legacy: Let a Million Museums Bloom - The New York Times XI’AN, China — This year, in a drive to promote awareness of China’s national heritage, the government introduced a free-admission policy at the country’s public museums. Officially the cultural establishment greeted the news with smiles. But the look of anxious exasperation on the face of a curator watching crowds of schoolchildren swarm through a gallery of ancient ceramics here on a recent morning told a different story. They touched every exposed surface, leaned on glass cases and smeared them with fingerprints. Body contact and the art experience seemed to be inseparable. A running joke is that once only a few people came to these institutions to see the art; now many will come, not for the art but for the air-conditioning. Such are the growing pains of museums in a country that feels both older and newer than any place on the planet. Archaeology pushes its history ever deeper into the past; a racing market economy makes Chinese-ness a mutable identity, under continuous revision. The country and its art institutions seem caught in the tension between self-images: the sovereign civilization apart on one hand, the ambitious scrambler in the global game on the other. Or so it feels to an art critic on a monthlong visit here, taking the measure of the Chinese art world against a panorama of devastating earthquakes and hectic preparations for the Olympic Games.
arts/design,China’s museums come in all sizes and types, from the majestic Shanghai Museum to shabby rooms in small-town Confucian temples. The artifacts are fabulous; what looks from afar like a dim little nothing display can leave you floored. (Contemporary-art museums are for the most part in a separate, still shaky category, an amalgam of public and corporate, for-hire affairs and collectors’ vanity showcases.) Yet most art is an unsettled category in China — “cultural relics” is the preferred term — and museums have complicated uses. They provide aesthetic delectation to be sure, but also moral education, pop entertainment and political propaganda. In a country that, culturally speaking, always has one foot on the gas and the other on the brake, art museums tend to be both innovative and conservative. They’re postmodern or premodern but skip the in between. There are exceptions. The new city museum in Suzhou is a Modernist showcase par excellence, pitched to international consumption. Designed by I. M. Pei, who spent part of his youth in that city of canals and scholars’ gardens, its clean lines and cream-and-gray architecture would look equally at home in Paris or New York. So would the spartan galleries, which exude art-speaks-for-itself Western taste and are as suited to party giving as art viewing. From outside, the splendid Shanxi Museum in Taiyuan looks far more exotic to the Western eye. Its inverted-pyramid shape is a kind of Chinese version of chinoiserie, like the New Agey mood music that emanates from fake rocks in public parks here. Yet the installation of archaic ritual bronzes will feel familiar to anyone who frequents the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s display of the same type of material in New York, so similar is the presentation.
arts/design,Almost shocking in their fierce, ponderous delicacy, they are joined here by complete sets of caldrons for ancestral offerings, carillons of giant bells and entire herds of fantastically fashioned beasts. The sight of them lined up in spotless cases, as if in a celestial department store, is an experience of formal perfection that an art specialist dreams about and comes to China for. The History of Chinese Art But it is not necessarily a typical experience here. With the goal of emphasizing the history over the art, other museums reject this “pure” form-as-content mode. Instead they emphasize not the precious object but the glorious, time-honored civilization that produced it. And in a country that has no encyclopedic world-culture museums, or even significant pan-Asian museums, that civilization is almost invariably China’s. To do so they call on exhibition devices — dioramas, stage props, ambient sound, films, interactive digital displays, extensive interpretive texts — often associated with museums of natural science, ethnology and archaeology. In utterly un-Met style, for example, the Shanxi Museum sets its magnificent group of Buddhist sculptures in a gallery of rough-textured, faux-sandstone walls honeycombed with niches. The intent is to evoke the famous rock-cut grottoes at Yungang elsewhere in Shanxi Province and visually to reconnect a religious art to its original concept. While a handful of progressive art institutions in the West have experimented with this sort of approach, it is routine in museums in China.
arts/design,Even less acceptable from a Western viewpoint is the casual approach some Chinese museums take toward exhibiting copies of artworks in place of originals. Fragile works that cannot survive gallery exposure may be represented by photographs. And when a well-known piece of art is unavailable, it may be considered preferable to display a copy — perhaps not acknowledged as such — rather than disappoint visitors. One kind of art in short supply, except at major museums like the Shanghai Museum and the Palace Museum at the Forbidden City in Beijing, is old masterpiece ink-and-brush scroll painting. Its absence may seem odd, considering that for centuries traditional scholarship has celebrated painting and calligraphy as China’s peak aesthetic achievements. An explanation lies at least partly in politics. The Political Aesthetic In 1949 the Chinese Nationalist Army, retreating from Communist forces, packed up vast chunks of the art holdings amassed by the late Qing emperors in the Forbidden City and shipped the material to Taiwan, where it remains today as the National Palace Museum. With that, China lost the cream of its national collection, most notably the ink-and-brush landscape paintings that defined its elite painting tradition. They were the classical canon, China’s power pictures. One might call them its equivalent to the Elgin Marbles, a Greek national treasure taken to England, although the comparison is inexact, and China would almost certainly not agree. To do so would be to acknowledge that Taiwan is no longer part of China, a concession that it refuses to make.
arts/design,Art is about power; certainly it always has been in China, with its ancient tradition of collecting and connoisseurship. The power to say “mine”; the power to control and manipulate images and ideas in the present; the power to claim the touchstone authority of the past; the power to advertise power. So it was only natural that, after 1949, the need for a new art canon would arise. And it would be built on art that was readily at hand, meaning art that was in China’s earth, which archaeologists redoubled their efforts to reveal. Ritual bronzes, long revered as links to imperial China’s mythic beginnings, became renewed emblems of national pride. Sculptures of a more perishable kind gained attention. The most abundant were from the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 618-906), earthen funerary figures of big-haired court beauties, snoozy servants and strutting demigods who populated a vivid “Upstairs, Downstairs” vision of the afterlife. The most spectacular figures, though, were the earliest: thousands of slightly larger than life-size terra-cotta soldiers made in the third century B.C. and buried at the tomb of the first Chinese emperor near Xi’an in central China. The first figures were discovered by farmers in 1974. Today the Terra Cotta Museum that stands on the site is one of the country’s most popular tourist spots. It is still an active excavation, but it is also an art museum, an anthropology museum, a research center, a recreation center, a theater, a nationalist monument and a theme park. And like any theme park it gives you lots to do.
arts/design,After lingering over the soldiers lined up in their original earthen trenches, you can watch a filmed re-enactment (wrap-around screen, thundering score) of the imperial tomb being built, then weave your way to lunch through a live army of Chinese tourists in baseball caps. This leaves time to visit gallery displays of weapons and coins from the site and to hit the gift shop, where Yang Peiyan, one of the farmers who first came upon the figures, occasionally presides. Elderly now, he will consent, for a modest tip, to autograph a catalog. Particularly striking was the current of patriotic sentiment running through the museum’s mix of action-adventure and history. For anyone coming to Xi’an directly from Beijing, the terra-cotta army might bring to mind other images, like the soldiers in Tiananmen Square at Mao Zedong’s mausoleum. Messages in the Medium Where do aesthetics and history stop, and politics start, in museums? This is a universal question. All museums are purveyors of ideology. Art is by nature promotional, pushing beliefs, broadcasting status, aggrandizing personalities. In some cases the dynamic of persuasion is a subtle one; in others it is not. The Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou uses the marvelous objects in its collection to trace a grand swath of local history, from the Iron Age to the founding of the People’s Republic. The display is fairly straightforward until it arrives at the early 19th century, a period of humiliation for China at the hands of colonial Europe. At that point, in an installation titled “Resist Foreign Intrusion,” the gallery labels become aggressively polemical.
arts/design,Popular awareness of intrusion in the form of cultural pillage has grown with time. In 1999 the Poly Art Museum in Beijing opened with the stated purpose of buying back important art objects that had, illegally or otherwise, left China. A few years ago it acquired at auction, for a steep price, three 18th-century sculptures believed to have been stolen in 1860 from the old Qing summer palace when it was plundered by marauding British and French troops. The purchase set off a wave of public patriotism: the nation had reclaimed a piece of its stolen inheritance. The sculptures’ value as art was almost beside the point. Their political history invested them with an intense charisma. If China’s effort to regain its patrimony is still in the testing stages, so are its efforts to preserve its treasures and promote its museums, which are growing in number, size and ambition. No one can predict what impact free admission will ultimately have, but museum officials express confidence that all will be right. People will learn proper behavior, they reason. Meanwhile, museums are experimenting with daily attendance limits and beefing up on guards. Experimentation is integral to  China’s public museums. The old is big news. Institutions are still excavating and discovering, still defining what art is and what it means. The city museum in Xi’an, which opened new quarters just last year, is a bracing example.
arts/design,I recently spent an afternoon there touring its galleries of carved jades, porcelains and Tang gold work before studying objects up close with curators in a storage area. Afterward, as they walked me out through a back hall, we came across a large form lying under a blanket on the floor. What was it? No one was sure, so we all crouched and lifted the blanket to see. It was a life-size sculpture of a Buddha or bodhisattva carved in a local stone, caked with dirt on one side but still brilliant with centuries-old vermilion paint on the other. Oh, yes, someone said, this just arrived. Workers found it in an orchard outside town. We all bent close. One by one we gently touched its surface, as if feeling for a pulse. As if touch were a form of seeing, we touched the past.
nyregion,Cuomo Hints Speech Will Offer Ethics Reforms After Week of Grand Proposals - The New York Times ALBANY —  Since the beginning of the year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has repeatedly implored New Yorkers to “think big,” a mantra he has seemingly also applied to his own State of the State address, which in effect he has made into a weeklong event. In recent days, the governor has rolled out a series of “signature proposals” up and down the state: He has promised to raise the pay of State University of New York workers and to spend more money on the environment; promoted major infrastructure projects on Long Island, in Manhattan and upstate; outlined better broadband and Wi-Fi in subway stations; and made plans for more minority-owned businesses and for criminal justice reforms. And while such a rollout may have robbed the speech on Wednesday of some of its drama — even Mr. Cuomo last week characterized it as a “boring speech” — it also seemingly gives the governor a chance to focus his speech on big themes, if he chooses. “It clears the deck,” said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonpartisan watchdog organization, and a former Cuomo aide. “So the State of the State can be all about what he wants it to be about.”
nyregion,The State of the State had traditionally offered the first formal look at the various legislative battlegrounds for the session to come. And the importance of the day has only been increased by the decision by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is serving his second term, to deliver his budget proposal the same day, most likely unveiling some $150 billion in proposed spending. Mr. Cuomo has offered hints that his speech will contain major new pushes on ethics, an issue that seems likely to hang over the speech — and over the rest of the legislative session, which runs through mid-June. Last year, he joshed during the State of the State speech with Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos, then the leaders of the Assembly and Senate, whom he referred to as his “amigos,” complete with a mock-up of the three men in sombreros. But that was then. During 2015, Mr. Silver, a Democrat, and Mr. Skelos, a Republican, were both arrested and convicted of federal corruption charges, leaving Mr. Cuomo as the only amigo left standing. On Monday, the governor’s own worries about legal problems eased when Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said that there was “insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime” regarding Mr. Cuomo’s sudden shutdown of an ethics panel known as the Moreland Commission. Speaker Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx, who succeeded Mr. Silver as leader of the Assembly, which Democrats dominate, said regaining the public’s trust remained a work in progress.
nyregion,“Every session is the session of ethics,” Mr. Heastie said in an interview on Tuesday, adding that his conference was already discussing caps on outside income and other ethics proposals this week. But even with the issue seemingly resonating in polls, the speaker cautioned that such proposals are complex and may take time. Moreover, he said, “Most of the people who come here come here for the right reasons.” Exactly what the governor plans to propose on ethics is uncertain, but it is expected to include a renewed call for more disclosure and transparency, and for closing the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which effectively allows corporate interests to funnel almost unlimited campaign funds to candidates through limited liability companies. While he has benefited from that loophole, in the past Mr. Cuomo has also supported closing it, as does Mr. Heastie. State Senator John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who serves as majority leader, has been noncommittal on ethics reform, and on paid family leave, another issue on which Mr. Heastie seems hopeful. The governor and Mr. Heastie also agree on wanting to raise the state minimum wage to $15, though that seems unlikely in the Republican-led Senate, where some members see such largess as anathema to their goal of adding jobs.
nyregion,Of course, that balance of power, too, could change with 2016 being an election year. Mr. Skelos’s conviction — and vacant Long Island Senate seat — left the Republicans clinging to the slimmest of majorities, made possible only by an allegiance with a Democrat, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn. A special election could be called by the governor as soon as April, though it is not clear whether Mr. Cuomo, who has worked well with the Republicans in the past, will do so. Another guessing game surrounds the governor’s plan for the homelessness crisis, which has emerged in recent weeks as another front in his long intraparty squabble with Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, who will travel to Albany on Wednesday to hear the speech for himself, and meet with the governor and other leaders. Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said his priorities for the session included the homeless; affordable housing; and education, including the issue of mayoral control of the city’s schools. The mayor had sought permanent control last year, only to be rebuffed by Mr. Flanagan, who would approve only a one-year extension. How the mayor is received in the state capital will be a notable undercurrent of the day, as will Mr. Cuomo’s proposals for the city. The governor has mentioned the city’s budget surplus in the past, though the mayor’s office says that such characterizations are inaccurate, noting that excess revenue has gone toward filling gaps in future budgets and shoring up reserves.
nyregion,Ms. Hinton seemed to suggest that the mayor had high hopes for progress, noting that he and his staff had “been meeting with state legislators for months” in hopes of winning over Albany and “pushing an aggressive legislative agenda that will benefit all New Yorkers.” But she said the mayor seems to know he would be expected to help those in Albany, too. “The mayor recognizes the relationship,” she said, “is a two-way street.”
technology,Nasty Gal, an Online Start-Up, Is a Fast-Growing Retailer - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — If ever there were a Cinderella of tech, Sophia Amoruso might be it. In 2006, Ms. Amoruso was a 22-year-old community college dropout, living in her step-aunt’s cottage, working at an art school checking student IDs for $13 an hour. Then she started a side project, Nasty Gal, an eBay page that sold vintage women’s clothing. Last year, Nasty Gal sold nearly $100 million of clothing and accessories — profitably. For the last seven years, Ms. Amoruso has been courting a cult following of 20-something women. Nasty Gal has more than half a million followers on Facebook and more than 600,000 on Instagram. But it is not yet well known beyond that base. At fashion trade shows, the company’s name still gets strange looks. “People say: ‘Nasty Gal? What’s that?’ ” Ms. Amoruso, now 28, said in an interview at her new headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. “I tell them, ‘It’s the fastest-growing retailer in the country.’ ” Back in 2006, she toyed with the idea of going to photography school, but couldn’t stomach the debt. Instead, she quit her job and started an eBay page to sell some of the vintage designer items she found rummaging through Goodwill bins. She bought a Chanel jacket at a Salvation Army store for $8 and sold it for $1,000. She found Yves Saint Laurent clothing online on the cheap by Googling misspellings of the designer’s name, reasoning that anyone who didn’t know how to spell Yves Saint Laurent probably didn’t realize his value.
technology,She styled, photographed, captioned and shipped each product herself and sold about 25 items a week. She named the eBay page “Nasty Gal” after the 1975 album by Betty Davis — not the smoky-eyed film star Bette Davis, but the unabashedly sexy funk singer and style icon Betty, whose brief marriage to the jazz legend Miles Davis inspired the song “Back Seat Betty.” Ms. Amoruso curated her eBay page to match her own style, which on a recent rainy Friday included a floor-length trench coat, vintage rock T-shirt, no-nonsense bob and blood-red lipstick. Her look and attitude resonated with the type of young, body-confident women who would not be caught dead in Tory Burch. She created a Myspace page to market Nasty Gal and garnered 60,000 “friends” by reaching out to fans of brands like Nylon, the music and fashion magazine, who she thought might appreciate Nasty Gal’s fierce aesthetic. Every week, her new finds ignited bidding wars among shoppers from Australia to Britain. She began enlisting friends to model and photograph her products, which quickly outgrew her step-aunt’s cottage. She moved Nasty Gal’s headquarters to a 1,700-square-foot studio in Berkeley, Calif., in 2007, and eight months later moved again — this time to a 7,500-square-foot warehouse space in Emeryville. Ms. Amoruso also outgrew eBay, which she said was a terrible platform to start a business. Competitors started flagging Nasty Gal for breaking the site’s rules by, for example, linking to Ms. Amoruso’s Myspace page. Fed up, she decided it was time to start ShopNastyGal.com. (At the time, NastyGal.com belonged to a pornography site. Nasty Gal now owns the domain.)
technology,She recruited a friend from junior high school to build a Web site and taught herself to use Photoshop. She eventually abandoned Myspace for Facebook, where she tantalized fans with coming inventory, from cheap shrunken motorcycle jackets to high-end vintage Versace clothing. She challenged her Facebook fans to come up with the best titles for vintage products and gave gift cards to the winners. She used models who were approachable and “looked like nice people, not dead people,” she said, and had to fire some when customers complained that they looked too skinny or annoyed. That constant conversation with customers created a loyal following. Nasty Gal has no marketing team, but fans comment on its every Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest post and regularly post pictures of themselves in their Nasty Gal finds. A quarter of Nasty Gal’s 550,000 customers visit the site daily for six minutes; the top 10 percent return more than 100 times a month. With Nasty Gal having made just shy of $100 million in revenue last year, analysts say they would expect a bigger audience. “I would expect them to have a few million visitors a month,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester analyst. On the flip side, Ms. Mulpuru said Nasty Gal’s conversion rate must be significantly higher than the industry standard of 3 percent. “It speaks to an engaged audience,” she said. “They’ve figured out the marketing tool. That’s the real story.”
technology,Ms. Amoruso knew Nasty Gal couldn’t grow by selling one-off vintage items forever; customers were asking why she didn’t have more sizes. So in 2008, she posted an ad on Craigslist for a buying assistant and hired Christina Ferrucci, the first person who answered. The two experimented with buying vintage-inspired clothes from vendors in Los Angeles’s fashion district. Soon, the items were selling so quickly that Ms. Amoruso and Ms. Ferrucci were making the six-hour drive to Los Angeles every other week. They ventured to the Project trade show in Las Vegas, where fashion brands and buyers convene every August, but higher-end brands weren’t exactly thrilled at the idea of having their products sold by a brand called Nasty Gal. Many dismissed it as an online sex shop. The fact that the NastyGal.com domain was at that time still owned by a pornography site didn’t help matters. Sam Edelman, the shoe brand, initially gave Ms. Amoruso the cold shoulder. She charged back an hour later, showed them Nasty Gal’s Web site on her iPhone and promised to deliver the brand some street cred. Sam Edelman acquiesced. That opened the door for a deal with Jeffrey Campbell, another shoemaker, which has become one of the most recognizable brands on the site. Nasty Gal fans will tell you Sophia Amoruso “made” Jeffrey Campbell, not the other way around.
technology,A Jeffrey Campbell spokeswoman, Sharon Blackburn, said that the brand was well established before partnering with Ms. Amoruso, but that Nasty Gal created a new channel for its more provocative styles, like the “Lita,” a towering lace-up platform boot with a five-inch heel. “Not a lot of people got it, but Sophia loved it,” Ms. Blackburn said. “She bought it in every color and fabric, wore it herself and opened the door for other styles in our collection.” By 2010, Nasty Gal started generating buzz among unlikely fans in Silicon Valley. Venture capital firms were pouring millions into e-commerce sites like ShoeDazzle.com, Kim Kardashian’s shoe subscription site, and BeachMint. But the company had been making money from Day 1. “They would say, ‘We want to invest in a woman-owned business — it’s part of our investment thesis,’ ” Ms. Amoruso recalled of her discussions with several venture capitalists. Her retort: She didn’t want to be part of their “investment thesis” and didn’t need their money. “I don’t think they got it,” she said. “It’s this bunch of guys sitting around saying, ‘Oh, yeah, let’s start a Web site and put Kim Kardashian’s face on it.’ ” Ms. Amoruso moved Nasty Gal to Los Angeles in 2011, to be closer to her merchants and models. She shunned office space in Santa Monica, where ShoeDazzle and BeachMint are based, for less glamorous space downtown, where 20-something Nasty Gal employees in mesh crop tops, leggings and platform shoes stand out from the paralegals. (Shortly after the move, one employee was berated by a lawyer in the building who saw “Nasty Gal Creative Studio” and assumed it was a pornography studio.)
technology,Last year, Ms. Amoruso, who had held on to 100 percent of her business, decided she was ready to hear what Sand Hill Road had to offer. She met with several venture capitalists but ultimately clicked with Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, who had invested in e-commerce sites like Net-a-Porter, Etsy and Asos. In March, Ms. Amoruso agreed to give Index a slice of equity for $9 million. But by August, things were moving so quickly — Nasty Gal was on track to quadruple its 2011 sales to $128 million — that she raised an additional $40 million from Index and used some of it to build a 500,000-square-foot fulfillment center in Shepherdsville, Ky. Nasty Gal now attracts more than six million visits a month, while e-commerce start-ups like ShoeDazzle and BeachMint are losing customers and executives. Bigger competitors are taking notes. Urban Outfitters recently contacted Ms. Amoruso about a potential acquisition, according to people briefed on the discussions. Asked about that, Ms. Amoruso said only, “We’re talking.” Naysayers in Silicon Valley think she should consider the acquisition. Some venture capitalists who would not speak on the record — perhaps because they did not have the chance to invest — say Nasty Gal is playing on a short-term fashion trend that will be difficult to sustain on the public market. “They’re the hot new thing, but I do think it’s risky,” said Ms. Mulpuru, the Forrester analyst. “With this type of hype, either they are looking for a big fat acquisition or a blockbuster I.P.O.”
technology,Ms. Amoruso is hardly ignorant of the possibility that it could all fall apart. Nasty Gal’s motto is, “Nasty Gals do it better.” But her personal motto is, “Only the paranoid survive.” At 18, Ms. Amoruso tattooed the Virgin Records logo on her arm. Last year, she enjoyed a small Cinderella moment when she got to show it to Richard Branson. She recently bought a Porsche — with cash — and is remodeling her dream home. But, she said, the Cinderella story ends here. “It’s been very charmed, but I’m not willing to rest on my laurels,” she said. “It’s only going to get harder to keep building from here.”
us,Hardship Makes a New Home in the Suburbs - The New York Times MORENO VALLEY, Calif. — The freeway exits around here are dotted with people asking for money, holding cardboard signs to tell their stories. The details vary only slightly and almost invariably include: Laid off. Need food. Young children. Mary Carmen Acosta often passes the silent beggars as she enters parking lots to sell homemade ice pops, known as paletas, in an effort to make enough money to get food for her family of four. On a good day she can make $100, about double what she spends on ingredients. On a really good day, she pockets $120, the extra money offering some assurance that she will be able to pay the $800 monthly rent for her family’s three-bedroom apartment. Sometimes, usually on mornings too cold to sell icy treats, she imagines what it would be like to stand on an exit ramp herself. “Everyone here knows they might have to be like that,” said Ms. Acosta, 40, neatly dressed in slacks and a chiffon blouse, as she waited for help from a local charity in this city an hour’s drive east of Los Angeles. Both she and her husband, Sebastian Plancarte, lost their jobs nearly three years ago. “Each time I see them I thank God for what we do have. We used to have a different kind of life, where we had nice things and did nice things. Now we just worry.”
us,Five decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a war on poverty, the nation’s poor are more likely to be found in suburbs like this one than in cities or rural areas, and poverty in suburbs is rising faster than in any other setting in the country. By 2011, there were three million more people living in poverty in suburbs than in inner cities, according to a study released last year by the Brookings Institution. As a result, suburbs are grappling with problems that once seemed alien, issues compounded by a shortage of institutions helping the poor and distances that make it difficult for people to get to jobs and social services even if they can find them. In no place is that more true than California, synonymous with the suburban good life and long a magnet for restless newcomers with big dreams. When taking into account the cost of living, including housing, child care and medical expenses, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to a measure introduced by the Census Bureau in 2011 that considers both government benefits and living costs in different parts of the country. By that measure, roughly nine million people — nearly a quarter of the state’s residents — live in poverty. Not long ago, the Inland Empire, as the sprawling suburban area east of Los Angeles is known, attracted people hoping to live out that good life. Before the recession, it was booming; housing developments were cropping up all the time, quickly followed by big box stores and strip malls to cater to the new residents.
us,The region was — and still is — the fastest growing in the state. But the jobs have never really followed the people who come here looking for cheaper housing. The median home value is $325,000 and the median rent is $1,690, according to the real estate database Zillow. That compares with $462,000 and $1,860 in Los Angeles. For many, those costs are still unaffordable. Unemployment in the region hovers around 10 percent and nearly one-fifth of all residents live in poverty, the highest rate among the largest metropolitan areas in the country. By the official federal measure, nearly one-third of all children here are poor. The number of poor in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties nearly doubled over the last decade. Many would-be workers lack office skills or more than a basic education, making minimum-wage jobs the norm for them. Many here are immigrants — some living in the United State illegally, making them ineligible for most government benefits. But like Ms. Acosta, many others came here legally decades ago and had a strong foothold in the American economy — a job, a house, cars and regular travel. “This is where poor people live now, and this is where they are going to live,” said Alan Berube, an author of the Brookings Institution study. “When poverty moved out of the inner cities it didn’t just go next door, it went 30 miles away. But at the time those families might not have been poor — they were just chasing the middle-class dream. Then, boom, that evaporated.”
us,Prosperity Slips Away Most mornings Sebastian Plancarte, 39, puts on a freshly laundered, collared polo shirt, carefully tucked in. He gets his daughter, Camila, dressed for kindergarten and makes sure his son, Sebastian, has his homework ready for middle school. They are out the door by 7:30 a.m. and he is home nearly two hours later, back to wander parking lots selling ice pops before the afternoon pickup routine begins. He is happy to be involved in his children’s lives, but this is hardly the kind of fatherhood he once imagined. For years, the couple thought of themselves as wealthy. They bought a five-bedroom house in a suburb just a few miles east of downtown Los Angeles, where they both worked in the jewelry district — she inspected diamonds and he designed bracelets and rings. Making $16 an hour, plus commissions, they earned as much as $2,000 a week. They traveled to San Diego and Las Vegas, they bought their two children the toys they asked for. Just more than a decade after they had emigrated from Mexico, they believed their hopes had become a reality. But in 2011, Ms. Acosta was laid off. So was Mr. Plancarte, just a few months later. They soon sold the house for far less than they had paid. They drove east, looking for something they could afford to rent, and landed in Moreno Valley, a city 60 miles inland that has become a common outpost for those priced out of Los Angeles. They live in a sprawling apartment complex designated for low-income families.
us,The paletas have become a centerpiece of their lives. The couple constantly think about the best prices for ingredients and how many pops are in their small freezer; they take orders by phone to deliver to backyard parties. When their son asks to get hamburgers at the local In-N-Out, they have a standard response: “The mathematics are very simple,” Ms. Acosta said. “If you want to eat there, we need you to sell $25” of the ice pops. “The hardest part is the shame,” Mr. Plancarte said, sitting at his kitchen table as his wife and daughter ate mango paletas doused in chamoy, a blood-red sugary hot sauce. “People say to me, ‘Why don’t you find a job over there, or at that factory or that place?’ First of all, they aren’t there, I’ve tried. But even if they have a job, it’s going to be paying me $8 an hour. So I’ll spend no time with my family to make less money than I make now selling these.” By Ms. Acosta’s calculation, the couple earned about $25,000 last year, nearly all of it in cash. And while it is nearly $2,000 above the official poverty line for a family of four nationally, it is hardly enough to meet their basic needs. By the time they pay for rent, gas, phone, electricity and food, they have spent about $2,000 a month, Ms. Acosta said.
us,Her husband is still looking for work; in the winter months they relied mostly on whatever she could make selling cosmetics and costume jewelry door to door. Their lives reflect the contradictions of many living on the edge. They have a 2001 Jeep Cherokee, a small flat-screen television and a few remaining pieces of jewelry. They don’t have health insurance or any savings, and they have not bought new clothes for nearly two years. For the last year, Ms. Acosta spent much of her time at the local Catholic Charities office, taking self-help classes with other women in similar circumstances. She earned $100 a month enrolling women in courses on healthy diets, balancing checkbooks and parenting skills. She keeps a folder thick with certificates she has earned in such classes. A letter from President Obama thanking her for volunteering at her son’s school, calling her a “shining example,” is tucked in a protective plastic sleeve. The few friends she has made here, she said, are the women she has met at Catholic Charities. “My friends in L.A., the ones who still have money, it’s like they forgot all about us,” she said. The family’s economic descent has proved most difficult for 12-year-old Sebastian, who remembers Christmas trips to Universal Studios and regular mall excursions. Camila, 5, cannot recall anything different from what she has now. Neither child knows that their Christmas gifts came from charity. They are all contributing to the piggy bank in the kitchen; if they can save enough, Ms. Acosta has promised to take them to Disneyland this year. For now, even going to the beach an hour west would cost too much for gas. The local park is hardly a fun outing — it reminds them of their work selling ice pops most weekends.
us,“We have to be really good actors,” Ms. Acosta said. “But after they go to bed, we just sit and worry about how we are going to pay for things we want to give them.” When his son asked for pizza recently, Mr. Plancarte took a silver bracelet he had given his wife to a pawnshop, where he was offered a fraction of what he thought it was worth. He accepted, too embarrassed to tell his son they could not have pizza. Ms. Acosta recently went back and saw the bracelet priced at $90 — more than twice what her husband had received. Traveling More to Make Less Sitting inside Catholic Charities offers a glimpse of the constant need: this family needs extra cash to pay the utility bill; this single mother cannot find child care to allow her to work a graveyard shift; that elderly man who came from Mexico has no way to pay for his medication. Imelda Santana, whose desk is just a few feet away from the entrance, is often the first stop for requests. Ms. Santana is empathetic — just a couple of years ago she needed help after her husband left her and she lost her job as a loan officer amid the housing crisis. After working as a volunteer for months, Ms. Santana was hired to sift through requests to see which families the organization might assist. Even on the best days, she said, there are more demands than they can handle.
us,“We have people here who used to make donations now knowing what it is to run out of toilet paper in their house and not have the money to buy more,” she said. “Even if they get food stamps, it does not cover toiletries. There’s just never enough.” Yadira Rodriguez, 35, has traveled hundreds of miles looking for work in this county, which is roughly the size of New Jersey. When her husband stopped earning enough to pay for monthly expenses for their three young children, she took a job in a factory packing boxes to be shipped to retail stores. But the $8-an-hour job was 30 miles north of her Moreno Valley apartment, taking her more than an hour in traffic, twice that if she needed to take the bus. Since she was classified as a temporary worker, she would leave her home at 4 a.m. only to find out at 6 a.m. that she would not be hired for the day. On days there was work, she would arrive back home 12 hours after she left. “I could not understand how this was worth the money,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “I would get home and the kids would be tired and cranky and I didn’t have energy for them. How was this going to make my life better?” After three months, she quit. Her family relies on $800 a month from the state’s temporary cash assistance program to pay for groceries and utilities, and gets occasional help from charities. The landlord has let the family slide on the rent at times, Ms. Rodriguez said.
us,Like Ms. Rodriguez, many would-be employees see unpredictability as a fact of life. Many social workers see more clients working two part-time minimum wage jobs, juggling schedules to make sure they do not disappoint any boss and hustling to cobble together child care for shifts that can begin or end before dawn. Many are immigrants who speak only basic English after years of living in Latino enclaves, first in Los Angeles, and now here. “This is the edge of affordability; people came here because they were pushed out to the only place where they could afford,” said John Husing, a local economist who has studied the region for years. “When they came here the primary wage earner could find a job to pay the bills. The problem is that time has passed and we don’t have a lot of jobs that allow that anymore.” While many of the state’s coastal areas have begun to see signs of an improved economy, the inland region has continued to struggle. Unemployment and foreclosure rates remain stubbornly high here and there are few signs that the area will boom as it did a decade ago. Housing prices have inched up as wages have stagnated, making it even more difficult for families to stay afloat.
us,“What we have out here is more need and fewer centers of resources,” said Dom Betro, the executive director of Family Services, a nonprofit group that provides child care and food to needy families in Riverside County. “We have more working poor than anyone can know how to handle. People travel further distances to work for less pay because they have to. Even if there is help — and that’s not always — people who need it can’t get to it.” Social workers here often point to a 2009 study by the James Irvine Foundation, which showed that the region has far fewer nonprofit groups per capita than the rest of the state, with less money funneled in from local foundations. “There’s all these new problems but no new philanthropic dollars there to address them,” said Mr. Berube, from the Brookings Institution. “In many places there are these de facto systems in place but not the kind of leadership to really address what’s needed.” When Larry Ellwell became principal of Victoria Elementary School in San Bernardino a few years ago, he was stunned by the number of families who could not afford necessities like clothes and dental care. When he worked with poor students closer to Los Angeles, he said, they knew where to find aid. But in the Redlands school district, home to a university and well-appointed mansions, there were few free clinics or other outlets for assistance. So he began to offer them — now the school hosts a roving clinic staffed by medical students and a clothing giveaway known as Victoria’s Closet.
us,“It’s a lot of triage work — who needs something the most and what do they most need,” Mr. Elwell said. “There’s no stigma anymore, because so many people are just trying to scrape by and make it work.” For Ms. Acosta, scraping by recently took a new turn: She moved to the other side of the desk at Catholic Charities, taking a job as an intake worker. She works about 30 hours a week at $12 an hour, giving people the same kind of help she seeks. Even now, she is not earning enough to stop selling ice pops. Just a couple of years ago, when the dry cleaner called reminding her to pick up a pair of pants, Ms. Acosta told him to give them to charity. “Now I am one of the people taking giveaways,” she said. “I see people all the time in worse positions than we are in. The kids are healthy, we have a roof. Maybe that’s the best we can hope for.”
us/politics,Trump Picks Christopher Wray to Be F.B.I. Director - The New York Times
world/africa,Nigeria Is Free of Ebola, Health Agency Affirms - The New York Times GENEVA —  The World Health Organization declared Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, officially free of Ebola infections on Monday, calling the outcome the triumphal result of “world-class epidemiological detective work.” The announcement came 42 days after the last reported infection in Nigeria’s outbreak, twice the maximum incubation period for the Ebola virus. The Nigerian response was upheld by the W.H.O. as an example of the measures other countries can take to halt the spread of the epidemic, which is concentrated in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. “This is a spectacular success story that shows that Ebola can be contained,” the W.H.O. said in a report on its website. But it also expressed caution that Nigeria cannot relax its defenses against the deadly virus. More than 9,000 people have become infected in the epidemic, over 4,500 people have died, and the number of infections is still doubling every month, the W.H.O. has reported. Although infection rates have slowed in some districts of the three worst affected countries, the organization has also reported the spread of the disease to new areas, including districts of Guinea bordering Ivory Coast. Nigeria’s outbreak started in July when Patrick Sawyer, an American of Liberian descent, traveled by air from Liberia to Lagos, the country’s biggest city, starting a chain of infection that spread the disease to 19 other people and resulted in eight deaths.
world/africa,Mr. Sawyer died five days after arriving, but the disease spread to Port Harcourt, Nigeria’s oil industry hub, after a close contact of Mr. Sawyer’s flew there for treatment, adding to fears that Nigeria faced what could become West Africa’s worst epidemic. Nigeria’s success in averting that outcome started with the action of Ameyo Stella Adadevoh, a doctor at First Consultant Hospital in Lagos who diagnosed the Ebola virus in Mr. Sawyer and later died of the disease. Together with Benjamin Ohiaeri, the hospital director, Dr. Adadevoh had insisted on keeping Mr. Sawyer isolated despite threats of legal action by Liberian officials demanding his release. Other important Nigerian actions cited by the W.H.O. included the quick response and close coordination of public health authorities and international organizations to isolate and treat patients, and the detective work of contact tracing teams. The teams drew on the experience of Nigeria’s anti-polio program to identify and monitor on a daily basis nearly 900 people who had contact with those infected with the disease. Still, Nigeria, like Senegal, which was declared free of Ebola on Friday, is susceptible to new cases by virtue of its proximity to the West African epicenter, health authorities warn. Nigeria also is at risk of becoming a victim of its own success. The W.H.O.’s representative in Nigeria, Rui Gama Vaz, said Ebola patients in the epicenter may now seek entry to Nigeria in an effort to get lifesaving care.
world/africa,“Many desperate people in heavily affected countries believe that Nigeria must have some especially good — maybe even ‘magical’ — treatments to offer,” a W.H.O. statement said.
arts/design,Paintings That Bear the Scars of War - The New York Times LIÈGE, BELGIUM — A looted Matisse portrait of a woman in a blue dress with white frills is displayed not far from a black swastika and a life-size photo of Adolf Hitler in uniform, striding away from a hazy Eiffel Tower. Paintings rarely get to share war stories in a museum exhibition, especially works like Matisse’s “Blue Dress in a Yellow Armchair” that have been pillaged, traded and salvaged by many hands. But this pensive painting is a testament to a dark history: ransacked by Nazis from a bank vault in 1941; shipped to Hitler’s second in command, Hermann Göring; and then ultimately displayed in a Norwegian museum until 2014, when it was returned to its rightful owners. That work and others by Picasso, Léger, Degas and Corot represent the legacy of Paul Rosenberg, a Jewish art dealer who amassed a vast collection in his silk-lined gallery on Rue la Boétie in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Rosenberg and his family survived the war in exile in New York, but more than 400 paintings were lost — 60 of them are still missing — and it became his quest to reclaim them work by work. Some of those disparate paintings are gathered for a reunion in “21 Rue la Boétie,” a roving exhibition of art and war history that began last month at La Boverie, the newly renovated Fine Arts Palace in this eastern Belgian city. The show will move to the Maillol Museum in Paris early next year and eventually to Jerusalem and New York. (Those events that are still being finalized, according to organizers.)
arts/design,The 63 works — which all passed through Rosenberg’s galleries in New York and Paris — have been lent by private collectors and European and American museums. The show honors the art dealer and his relationships with emerging avant-garde artists like his next door neighbor, Picasso, and Georges Braque. It also explores state-sponsored looting during World War II with photographs and anti-Jewish posters, and propaganda produced in Rosenberg’s ornate gallery and enormous townhouse, which was commandeered by the Nazis in 1941 to create an office for the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question. “The idea is that this is a form of justice to expose the works that were plundered, stolen, and vanished,” said Anne Sinclair, the art dealer’s granddaughter, who is a well-known French television journalist and the editorial director of Le Huffington Post. Her 2012 book, “My Grandfather’s Gallery,” inspired the exhibition. She also helped enlist collectors to make loans and aided the show’s designers, Tempora, a Brussels design company. The exhibition does not include Matisse’s “Seated Woman/Woman Sitting in an Armchair,” which was recovered by the Rosenberg family last year. The long-vanished painting of a woman in an embroidered blouse was discovered in 2012 in the art trove hoarded by Cornelius Gurlitt in his Munich apartment. Organizers said that it still needed restoration before it went public.
arts/design,But there are other major works with somber pedigrees, like a Picasso portrait of Ms. Sinclair’s grandmother on a tapestry chair with her chubby toddler in white and blue ribbons. It was stolen for Hermann Göring and then later recovered by Rosenberg soon after the war. “If it could only tell what it saw,” Ms. Sinclair said. The exhibition has also brought together rare works from private collections still caught up in thorny debates about restitution and transparency about their wartime provenance. For example, David Nahmad, an art dealer and a Monaco billionaire, is loaning nine of his works by Picasso, Matisse and other artists from his extensive collection, much of it stored in a freeport warehouse in Switzerland. For almost five years, he has been fending off a legal claim for his 1918 Modigliani portrait of a merchant, pressed by the elderly French grandson of a Jewish antique dealer and by a company specializing in recovering looted art for a percentage of a sale. Mr. Nahmad is attempting to dismiss the case, which is pending in New York State Supreme Court. He argues that long-sealed, French postwar court documents demonstrate they are chasing the wrong Modigliani portrait. Mr. Nahmad, who is Jewish himself and was stung by widespread publicity over the case and his offshore Panamanian company, said his participation in the exhibition has nothing to do with his current legal struggle. But the ordinarily low profile dealer is playing a highly visible role in the show — including cajoling other private collectors to make loans and seeking to stage an exhibition at a New York museum that has not been announced yet.
arts/design,“There is a lot of history in this exhibition and this is not a pure show,” he said, after appearing at the opening with Ms. Sinclair, who asked him to join the exhibition in April. “To see Hitler, the occupation, the gallery and the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question... It touched me.” The Emil Bührle foundation in Zurich is lending Camille Corot’s “A Girl Reading,” a tranquil portrait of a young woman in a red bodice that was plundered in 1941 from Rosenberg’s bank vault in Libourne, France, along with more than 160 paintings. It was purchased by Emil Georg Bührle, a wealthy arms merchant for the Nazis, who battled with the art dealer in court over looted works and reimbursed him for the painting in 1948 and returned others. Today a new extension is under construction to house his collection in the Kunsthaus, Zurich’s fine arts museum, and has provoked a debate about how much wartime history should be described in a permanent museum exhibition. The exhibition is also helping to inaugurate the recent makeover of La Boverie, a 1905 building, which completed a 25 million-euro expansion by the architect Rudy Ricciotti last May. The show is financed in part by the city of Liège and by Belgium’s national lottery. The building also played a role on the eve of the war in 1939, when the local government raised money to buy nine works offered by Nazi authorities at a Lucerne auction in an effort to dispose of thousands of “degenerate” artworks, confiscated from German museums, by some of the greatest artists of the period, including Gauguin, Chagall, Matisse and Picasso.
arts/design,Those purchases, such as Gaugin’s “Magician of Hiva Oa,” are on display in the show, as is a Picasso portrait of a picnicking family, “La Famille Soler,” that is exhibited next to a gauzy, traditional painting by Rodolf Otto of a German peasant family of parents and children to illustrate the Nazi taste for more sentimental, realistic works. When the exhibition opened, Ms. Sinclair brought relatives to study cherished family portraits that she remembered from her childhood. She said that she is continuing her grandfather’s work, a reckoning of history so that the dead “may return less sadly to their graves.”
nyregion,Spitzer Said to Be Weighing Resignation - The New York Times ALBANY — Gov. Eliot Spitzer continued to weigh whether to resign early Tuesday, a day after law enforcement officials said he was a client of a high-end prostitution ring broken up last week by federal authorities. Mr. Spitzer received counsel from his advisers late Monday at his Fifth Avenue apartment, and had not emerged as of early Tuesday morning. A top administration official said Tuesday morning that no announcement had been scheduled. The disclosure of Mr. Spitzer’s involvement with the prostitution operation threatened to end his career and turned the state’s political world upside down. His involvement came to light in court papers filed last week, the officials said, as federal prosecutors charged four people with operating the service, Emperor’s Club V.I.P. Mr. Spitzer was caught on a federal wiretap discussing payments and arranging to meet a prostitute in a Washington hotel room last month. The affidavit, which did not identify Mr. Spitzer by name, indicated that he had used the prostitution service before, although it was not clear how often. Mr. Spitzer, 48, who is married with three daughters, appeared briefly with his wife at his Manhattan office on Monday to apologize, but did not specifically address any involvement with the ring. He said he needed to repair his relationship with his family and decide what was best for the state, but he declined to take questions, leaving after barely a minute.
nyregion,“I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my, or any, sense of right and wrong,” the governor said. “I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public to whom I promised better.” “I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself. I must now dedicate some time to regain the trust of my family.” The governor, a Democrat in his first term, then returned to his apartment on Fifth Avenue, where news vans and police cars clogged traffic. Mr. Spitzer did not emerge overnight and did not appear early Tuesday for his regular morning jog. The New York Times began investigating Mr. Spitzer’s possible involvement with a prostitution ring on Friday, the day after the prosecutors arrested the four people on charges of helping run the Emperor’s Club. After inquiries from The Times over the weekend and on Monday, the governor canceled his public schedule. An hour after The Times published a report on its Web site saying Mr. Spitzer had been linked to the ring, the governor made his statement. The news was met with disbelief and shock in Albany, a capital accustomed to scandal. Some legislative assistants said they were too stunned to speak, and lawmakers gathered around television sets in hushed offices, trying to make sense of what had happened. “We’re at a total standstill,” said Keith L. T. Wright, a Democratic assemblyman from Harlem. “Everybody is stunned. Everybody is absolutely stunned.”
nyregion,Mr. Spitzer has not been charged with a crime. But one law enforcement official who has been briefed on the case said that Mr. Spitzer’s lawyers would probably meet soon with federal prosecutors to discuss any possible legal exposure. The official said the discussions were likely to focus not on prostitution, but on how it was paid for: Whether the payments from Mr. Spitzer to the service were made in a way to conceal their purpose and source. That could amount to a crime called structuring, which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, declined to comment. If Mr. Spitzer were to resign, Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson would serve out the remainder of his term. Mr. Paterson, who is legally blind, would become the first black governor of New York. State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the state’s top Republican, would assume the duties of the lieutenant governor. By 10:30 on Monday morning, it was clear in Albany that something was wrong. Mr. Spitzer’s office abruptly canceled a speech to a family planning conference, about a half-hour before he was scheduled to ascend the podium. The governor also canceled a private meeting with Cardinal Edward M. Egan, at first sending word that Mr. Paterson would stand in for him, and then abandoning the session altogether.
nyregion,The governor learned that he had been implicated in the prostitution inquiry when a federal official contacted his office on Friday, according to the person briefed on the case. On Saturday night, he attended the Gridiron Club annual dinner, a political roast put on by Washington journalists, and appeared ebullient, according to people in attendance. The governor informed his top aides on Sunday night and Monday morning of his involvement. Mr. Spitzer’s family and his top assistants debated Monday morning at Mr. Spitzer’s apartment about whether he should step down, a person who spoke to the governor said. Silda Wall Spitzer, who was among them, told her husband that he should not resign in haste; as did Lloyd Constantine, a senior adviser and a longtime friend of the governor. But most of his others saw no way for him to survive. Dietrich L. Snell, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Spitzer in the past, did not return telephone and e-mail messages Monday. According to prosecutors, the Emperor’s Club provided women to clients in London, Paris, Miami and other cities, and charged them between $1,000 and $5,500 an hour. The affidavit details a Feb. 13 encounter between a prostitute named Kristen and a man described as “Client 9,” whom law enforcement officials identified as Mr. Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer traveled to Washington that evening, according to a person told of his travel arrangements, and stayed at the Mayflower Hotel.
nyregion,He testified before Congress about the bond insurance crisis the following morning. Among the open questions is where Mr. Spitzer’s security detail was while the prostitute was inside the hotel. The affidavit says that he met with the woman in Room 871 but does not identify the hotel. Room 871 at the Mayflower that evening was registered under the name George Fox. One of the law enforcement officials said that several people running the prostitution ring knew Mr. Spitzer by the name of George Fox, though a few of the prostitutes came to realize he was the governor of New York. Mr. Fox is a friend and a donor to Mr. Spitzer. Asked in a telephone interview on Monday whether he accompanied Mr. Spitzer to Washington on Feb. 13 and 14, Mr. Fox responded: “Why would you think that? I did not.” Told that Room 871 at the Mayflower Hotel had been registered in Mr. Fox’s name with Mr. Spitzer’s Fifth Avenue address, Mr. Fox said, “That is the first I have heard of it. Until I speak to the governor further, I have no comment.” In a wiretapped conversation after the encounter, the prostitute, Kristen, called her booker to inform her that the session had gone well, and that she did not find the client “difficult,” as other prostitutes apparently had, according to the affidavit. The booker responds that he, in an apparent reference to Client 9, sometimes asks the women “to do things that, like, you might not think were safe.”
nyregion,Mr. Spitzer called Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, on Monday afternoon after his statement, but his aides did not share details of the conversation. Mr. Paterson was said to be keeping a low profile, awaiting the governor’s decision. About 6 p.m., Richard Baum, the governor’s top aide, met with Mr. Spitzer’s staff but made no mention of a resignation and urged his colleagues to keep their heads down and continue as best they could with the day-to-day work of state government. Albany for months has been roiled by bitter fighting and accusations of dirty tricks. The Albany County district attorney is set to issue the results of his investigation into Mr. Spitzer’s first scandal, his aides’ involvement in an effort to tarnish Mr. Bruno. Mr. Spitzer was elected in a landslide in 2006, capitalizing on his popularity he won as the “Sheriff of Wall Street” during eight years as attorney general. With a reputation for personal probity and independence, he pledged to bring higher ethical standards to the statehouse. After promising change in Albany from “Day 1,” Mr. Spitzer was quickly plunged into political turmoil, and much of his legislative agenda was sidelined. He gained a reputation for being intemperate and alienated even some members of his own party. In recent weeks, however, Mr. Spitzer seemed to have rebounded, with his party poised to perhaps gain control of the state Senate for the first time in four decades.
nyregion,The revelation about Emperor’s Club and the attendant disruption in Albany comes at a particularly bad time: The state faces a $4.4 billion deficit and is weeks away from its deadline to complete a new budget. “Every year you say you’ve seen it all, but you haven’t,” said Matthew Mataraso, a lobbyist who started his career at the Capitol in 1962 as a lawyer for a Republican assemblyman. “It’s a shame. It’s awful. This is why people lose faith in government. But I guess it shows that he’s human like everybody else.” Anthony Casale, a lobbyist and a former assemblyman who came to the Capitol on Monday for the scheduled Assembly session, was in disbelief. “Literally, if ever a situation finds anybody in politics speechless, it’s something like this,” he said. Republicans were quick to pounce, with the state party and a top lawmaker calling for him to resign. “The governor who was going to bring ethics back to New York State, if he was involved in something like this,” said James N. Tedisco, the Republican minority leader of the Assembly, “he’s got to leave. I don’t think there’s any question about that.” Mr. Bruno said, “I think it’s very, very unfortunate and I feel very badly for the governor’s wife, for his children.” He added, “The important thing for the people of New York State is that people in office do the right thing,” he added. Mr. Spitzer’s fellow Democrats were muted in their response.
nyregion,Mr. Silver, the Assembly speaker, issued a terse two-sentence statement: “The allegations against the Governor are before the public. I have nothing to add at this time.” When he was attorney general, Mr. Spitzer’s signature issue was pursuing Wall Street misdeeds. But he also oversaw the prosecution of at least two prostitution rings by the state’s organized crime task force, which reports to the attorney general. In one such case in 2004, Mr. Spitzer spoke with revulsion and anger after announcing the arrest of 16 people for operating a high-end prostitution ring out of Staten Island. “This was a sophisticated and lucrative operation with a multitiered management structure,” Mr. Spitzer said at the time. “It was, however, nothing more than a prostitution ring.”
magazine,Making Bathrooms More ‘Accommodating’ - The New York Times The clearest visual markers of sex difference many of us see in the course of the day are the signs on public bathroom entrances: MEN on one door, WOMEN on the other. Restrooms are public conveniences, freely available in most places and in principle open to all, but the terms for entering them have been fixed. They’re fundamentally fraught spaces, where we undress and obey the dictates of our bodies and therefore feel vulnerable. If people think you’ve confused male and female and walked through the wrong door, you risk discomfort, or even real trouble. This can lead to the spectacle of women standing in line for what feels like forever while the men’s room is empty. Now transgender people, most prominently, are asking society to rethink all of this, from signs to design to who gets to enter where. Many people viscerally resist the idea of mixing male and female anatomy in multistall bathrooms and locker rooms. In Houston earlier this month, voters rejected a broad equal rights ordinance that protected against discrimination in housing and employment, as well as public spaces, on the basis of several categories, including age and race along with sexual orientation and gender identity. Opponents focused their campaign narrowly, nicknaming the law the ‘‘bathroom ordinance.’’ They created ‘‘No Men in Women’s Bathrooms’’ T-shirts and a TV ad with sinister images of a man threatening a girl in the stalls, successfully playing on voters’ fears.
magazine,School districts throughout the country have generally agreed to call transgender students by their preferred names and pronouns, and allowed them to join the sports teams of the gender with which they identify. But deciding where they should change and shower and use the bathroom has been trickier. In suburban Illinois, a transgender high-school student who is undergoing hormone therapy and has a passport identifying her as female asked to change in the girls’ locker room. The district refused, saying that ‘‘privacy concerns’’ required sending her to a separate room down the hall. She and her family brought a civil rights complaint, and the United States Department of Education intervened earlier this month, asking the district to give her the right to shower and change in the same locker room with her female peers. A privacy curtain could address both her needs and other students’ concerns, the Education Department said — as long as other girls are also allowed to change behind the curtain, if they choose.
magazine,A word that comes up frequently in discussions about access to bathrooms is ‘‘accommodate,’’ and it is a telling one. ‘‘Accommodate’’ comes from the Latin for ‘‘to make fitting.’’ It means to adapt, to bring into agreement or harmony, to furnish with something desired or needed, to favor or oblige. It can be a word of welcome and hospitality coming from a concierge or maître d’. But it can also have a compulsory aspect — it’s a word that involves moving over to make room for other people, whether you want to or not. In the 1960s, Congress gave religious people a right to reasonable accommodation at work, like a place to pray, or time off on the Sabbath, or permission to wear a turban or kipa or hijab. In 1990, the Americans With Disabilities Act afforded a similar right to people who had been shut out by doors they could not open and stairs they could not climb. For them, fighting for accommodation in bathrooms was central. If you can’t get into one and use it, you can’t work in a building or go to a concert.
magazine,Activists for all manner of marginalized groups have chafed at the word ‘‘accommodation.’’ It often sets up a distinction between the normal and the other. One group’s needs determine a basic shape, and then another group comes along and asks to alter the contours. But the word also allows for the possibility of mu­tual give and take. ‘‘It implies a two-way street,’’ says Mara Keisling, co-founder and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. ‘‘Having a civil society is all about accommodation. Any relationship demands that.’’ She thinks transgender people have been doing all the accommodating when it comes to the bathroom. But for a lot of people, the transgender bid to reconsider norms — the vocabulary, a girl who has a penis — has burst into the public consciousness quickly, and seems bewildering. However natural separating men and women in the bathroom may seem, it’s a cultural creation, with its roots in the Victorian era. States started to require sex-segregated ‘‘water closets’’ in the 19th century, when women entered spaces that men previously dominated, like factories, parks and libraries. Privacy and sanitation justified partitioning those early and rudimentary bathrooms; so did concern for the ‘‘weaker body of the woman worker,’’ as the University of Utah law professor Terry Kogan points out in an article on the history of sex-separated public bathrooms. Shopgirls got ‘‘retiring rooms’’ out of concern that they were prone to dizziness and fainting. Outside the home, beyond the bounds of the cult of domesticity, women supposedly needed a haven. But it was an exclusive one. When government offices integrated in the 1940s, some white women refused to share bathrooms with their black co-workers, claiming they would catch syphilis from towels and toilet seats.
magazine,Today women curse the time wasted waiting for a stall, while on the other side of the wall, urinals keep the line moving for men. (We could see the urinal as an accommodation for the male body, but we treat men as the norm, so we don’t.) Some feminists see this lack of parity as a problem of ‘‘everyday sexism,’’ as the writer Soraya Chemaly put it earlier this year. The sociologist Erving Goffman pointed out that the environment in a women’s room is expected to be more refined and genteel than that of a men’s room, a relaxing ‘‘all-female enclave.’’ It also establishes ‘‘a sort of with-then-apart rhythm’’ for the sexes, with periods of intermingling among men and women punctuated by moments of separation. Over time, women have become attached to the camaraderie of the ladies’ room. When girlfriends want to chat, they head there. And now some of them are disturbed by what they see as an incursion by male anatomy. That’s their explanation for the ‘‘No Men in Women’s Bathrooms’’ T-shirts in Houston, and the resistance to letting transgender students into the locker room. It’s poignant: Transgender women say they are women, but some other women can only see them as men, and so they don’t want to make room. ‘‘I am a bleeding-heart liberal — but in this new development I can’t help but feel that people with two X chromosomes are once again having their rights pushed aside to accommodate people with a Y and X chromosome,’’ a commenter wrote in The Times’s Motherlode blog.
magazine,The problem is that this vastly oversimplifies the experience of transgender people and the biology of chromosomes, which can appear in other combinations. There is a spectrum of male and female, and no one definition of accommodation. Some people, transgender or otherwise, like single-stall bathrooms that are unisex (or all-gender, the word that’s lately in favor). Maybe they want more privacy or their bodies take an unusual shape for any number of reasons. But for transgender girls, the locker room and the bathroom are about joining the all-female enclave, about fitting in. ‘‘I just want to be with the girls at all times,’’ a 12-year-old transgender girl in Connecticut told me. Her coed school, where she started this year, lets her use the girls’ locker room. She showers in her underwear, which other girls her age do as well. ‘‘I don’t walk into the changing room and feel like, Oh, my God, I can’t believe I’m here. It feels just as natural to be in there with girls as it does to be in the classroom with boys and girls.’’ She recently started revealing her full gender identity to the friends she has made this fall. It has been a little scary, she said, but so far, they haven’t pulled away.
magazine,The framework of accommodation is useful, as a starting place, because it’s practical. For people with disabilities, reasonable accommodation is about a bar next to the toilet and a button that opens the door. For transgender kids, it’s showe­ring near your peers in your own stall, and then maybe getting dressed behind a privacy curtain. (Other girls with their own reasons for shielding their bodies from view might welcome a curtain, too.) It’s about relatively small adjustments for the sake of coexistence. It doesn’t seem like much compared with the self-contorting accommodations that the public bathroom can demand of transgender people. The Transgender Law Center offers a resource guide, ‘‘Peeing in Peace,’’ with a variety of strategies for going into the restroom of your choice. One is called Invisibility: ‘‘Don’t look at or speak to anyone.’’ Another is called Gender Proof: ‘‘Try pointing out your physical characteristics if they will help prove that you belong. For example, if you have breasts, try pointing them out to prove that you belong in the women’s room. If you have a deep voice, try speaking to show that you belong in the men’s room.’’ The ache lies in the word ‘‘belong’’ — another basic human need we all share.

science,Scientists Find Way to Gauge Earth's Glow - The New York Times The eerie glow of earthshine -- sunlight bouncing off Earth and striking the Moon -- makes the dark part of the Moon's disk just barely visible to the naked eye. Now a team of astronomers and physicists has done what the eye cannot. They have detected slight variations in the glow, in effect, variations in how much sunlight Earth reflects hour by hour, season to season and year to year. They say the results lend tenuous support to a highly controversial theory that Earth is cloudier, and therefore reflects more sunlight, when the Sun is near the minimum of its 11-year activity cycle and has the fewest sunspots and solar storms. Other scientists are praising the researchers' technique, which they say may one day be useful in studies of climate. But they dismiss the  early conclusions as little more than moonshine. These critics say they fear the findings will give support to critics of the idea that greenhouse gases cause global warming. But the team of researchers, who made their observations at Big Bear Observatory in California and who will report their findings in the May 1 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, say they are simply turning to earthshine as a way of sharpening scientists' knowledge of how much solar radiation Earth reflects.
science,''If you think about what drives our climate, it's the net sunshine that reaches us,'' said Dr. Philip R. Goode, the leader of the research and the director of Big Bear, which is owned by the New Jersey Institute of Technology. ''That depends on the sun's output and how much the mirror of the Earth reflects.'' Earth's overall reflectivity, or albedo, depends almost entirely on cloud cover and is difficult to measure with any certainty using satellites, said Dr. Loren Acton, a solar physicist at Montana State University who was not involved in the research. He said satellites were often too close to see the big picture. Using earthshine is ''pretty straightforward and pretty clever,'' Dr. Acton said. But Dr. Stephen H. Schneider, a Stanford climatologist, said it was ''very unlikely'' that solar activity could replace greenhouse gases as the likely cause of global warming. The new measurements, which used a small telescope outfitted with an electronic camera, were made over about seven years.The observations resurrected an idea tried by a French astronomer in the 1930's, said Dr. Steven E. Koonin, a professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology who collaborated on the work. Dr. Koonin said that in the early 1990's, he realized new techniques for translating the earthshine into an albedo could turn earthshine into an important tool. Observers grew accustomed to seeing fluctuations of up to 10 percent in the earthshine over a single night. They also saw unexpectedly large seasonal variations.
science,The scientists also found sketchy indications that the average albedo was a few percentage points greater around 1995, a minimum of solar activity, compared to the present, a period of maximum activity. That sort of difference might be expected according to the controversial notion that cosmic rays, or high-energy particles from space, seed clouds. The more powerful magnetic fields generated by the Sun during maximum activity are known to block many of the particles, which would theoretically lead to less cloud cover and less reflection, or a lower albedo. But many scientists challenge that theory. Aside from the issue of whether cosmic rays really do seed clouds, Dr. Schneider said, some clouds primarily trap heat, warming Earth, and others mainly reflect sunlight, cooling it. Cosmic rays would presumably make both kinds. Other climate experts echoed that caution but said it did not doom earthshine as a novel way of peering back at Earth. ''It's a valuable new tool for looking at a fundamental aspect of Earth's climate,'' said Dr. Eric Sundquist, a geochemist at the United States Geological Survey and chairman of the American Geophysical Union's committee on global environmental change.
sports/olympics,Runners Help Each Other After Fall: ‘Get Up. We Have to Finish This.’ - The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO — New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin was lying on the track, dazed after a heavy fall and with her hopes of an Olympic medal seemingly over. Suddenly, there was a hand on her shoulder and a voice in her ear: “Get up. We have to finish this.” It was American Abbey D’Agostino, offering to help. “I was like, “Yup, yup, you’re right. This is the Olympics Games. We have to finish this,’” Hamblin said. It was a scene to warm the hearts of fans during a qualifying heat of the women’s 5,000 meters. Hamblin and D’Agostino set aside their own hopes of making the final to look out for a fellow competitor. It started when D’Agostino clipped Hamblin from behind and they both went sprawling with about 2,000 meters to go. Hamblin fell heavily on her right shoulder. D’Agostino got up, but Hamblin was just lying there. She appeared to be crying. Instead of running in pursuit of the others, D’Agostino crouched down and put her hand on the New Zealander’s shoulder, then under her arms to help her up, and softly urged her not to quit. “That girl is the Olympic spirit right there,” Hamblin said of D’Agostino. “I’ve never met her before. Like I never met this girl before. And isn’t that just so amazing. Such an amazing woman.”
sports/olympics,As it turned out, D’Agostino probably needed more help: She soon realized she’d hurt her ankle in the fall. Grimacing, she refused to give up, though, running nearly half the race with the injury. Hamblin did what she could, hanging back with D’Agostino for a little while to return the favor and offer encouragement. “She helped me first. I tried to help her. She was pretty bad,” Hamblin said. She eventually had to leave D’Agostino behind and was certain that the American would have to stop. Nope. “I didn’t even realize she was still running. When I turned around at the finish line and she’s still running, I was like, wow,” Hamblin said. She waited for her new friend to cross the line — D’Agostino had been lapped — and they hugged. This time, it was D’Agostino who was in tears. As D’Agostino was about to be taken away in a wheelchair, she stretched out her right hand and the two runners gripped each other’s forearms for a few moments. In an Olympics that has seen a few unsavory incidents — the Egyptian judoka who refused to shake hands with his Israeli opponent, the booing of a French pole vaulter by the Brazilian crowd — Hamblin and D’Agostino provided a memory that captured the Olympic spirit. Olympic officials also decided that both runners, and Austria’s Jennifer Wenth, who was also affected by the collision, would have places in Friday’s final.
sports/olympics,“I’m never going to forget that moment,” Hamblin said. “When someone asks me what happened in Rio in 20 years’ time, that’s my story ... That girl shaking my shoulder, (saying) ‘come on, get up’.”

us,Court Limits California’s Power to Punish Farmers in Drought - The New York Times SACRAMENTO —  A judge ruled Friday that California regulators violated some farmers’ rights by telling them to stop diverting from rivers and streams, but the state said it can still punish those who illegally take water during the drought. The temporary restraining order by Judge Shelleyanne Chang of Sacramento Superior Court blocked the state from punishing farmers who ignored a state notice issued earlier this year to stop diverting water. The ruling applies to dozens of farmers in the Central Valley and the irrigation districts serving them. The two sides had divergent views of what the ruling meant, with lawyers for the farmers suggesting it threw all the state’s cutbacks into question, while the state said it only meant it needed to tweak its notices. Residents, farmers and businesses across California have endured water restrictions because of the state’s four-year dry spell. Thousands have received so-called curtailment notices in the last year, but only about a third responded to confirm they stopped taking water. The judge ruled Friday that the water board’s notices improperly told districts and landowners with water rights to stop taking water without holding a hearing first. The ruling bars the state from fining people who do not fill out paperwork responding to notices, but says they can still be investigated for illegal water diversions. Penalties are as high as $1,000 a day and $2,500 per acre-foot of water taken illegally.
us,“The court has reminded the state board that water rights are a form of property rights, and they have to use a lot more care when they are trying to regulate them,” said Jennifer Spaletta, a lawyer for the Central Delta Water Agency, which represented dozens of farmers. The State Water Resources Control Board says the ruling may require it to tweak its notice letters, but still allows it to punish those who illegally take water. “The judge only took umbrage with some of the language,” said David Rose, a lawyer with the water board. Mr. Rose says the board will hold hearings before it issues any penalties.
nyregion,Cuomo Joins Call to Curb Topless Women in Times Square - The New York Times Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday joined the call for a crackdown on the nearly naked women in body paint who pose for photos in Times Square. In an interview on NY1, the governor said the women were breaking the law and undermining the family-friendly allure of a neighborhood that government tax breaks had helped clean up. “I believe this activity is illegal,” Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said. “I believe it is infringing on legitimate businesses. I think it is infringing on the investment that the state and the city made in the 42nd Street area, and I think it has to be stopped.” The governor’s remarks came a day after a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the women were not creative artists, but pushy panhandlers whose efforts to coax cash from tourists should be regulated. Along with body paint, the women, known as desnudas, wear feathered headdresses and thongs as they strut around Times Square seeking tips. They have drawn scrutiny this summer after complaints that some are overly aggressive in demanding payment. Amid the criticism, some women had words like “freedom” and “my right” painted on their bodies on Wednesday. It has been legal for women to go topless in New York since 1992, when the state’s Court of Appeals ruled in People v. Santorelli that New York’s public lewdness laws did not apply to a woman baring her breasts in public. State law also permits nudity — partial and full — in plays and other artistic performances.
nyregion,An aide to Mr. Cuomo said the governor did not believe the women were violating the lewdness laws, but did think their tactics flouted laws against harassment, aggressive panhandling and impeding pedestrian traffic. “I believe we can enforce the law and clean it up,” Mr. Cuomo said in the NY1 interview. Any effort to rein in the women could raise constitutional issues, civil rights lawyers said. For instance, if the courts interpreted the desnudas’ activity as performance, the women might be afforded free speech protection under the First Amendment. The women could also argue that the government was discriminating against them, violating the Constitution’s equal-protection clause, because men are not barred from performing topless in public for money. A noted example is the Naked Cowboy, a Times Square fixture. “The governor’s statement is simplistic,” Normal Siegel, a New York civil rights lawyer, said. “He doesn’t take into account state and federal equal-protection and First Amendment case law, and we suggest he rethink his position.” Saira Nicole, 29, who paraded through Times Square on Wednesday in red, white and blue body paint and underwear, the word “freedom” on her back, said Mr. Cuomo was wrong. “I feel like it’s not a problem when big companies profit off of women’s bodies,” she said. “But when a woman as an individual wants to have fun, wants to celebrate New York City, it’s a problem.”
world,Severe Earthquake Strikes India, Killing Thousands - The New York Times Rescue teams worked under floodlights through the night and into the morning here, often with their bare hands, to clear the rubble of collapsed buildings as they struggled to save the victims of a devasting earthquake that struck the western state of Gujarat on Friday morning and shook the subcontinent from top to bottom. More than 2,300 people are confirmed dead, and officials say the toll could rise by thousands. The earthquake, the most intense in India in almost half a century, rumbled across Gujarat shortly before 9 a.m. Friday, collapsing thousands of simple homes in Bhuj, a city of 150,000 close to the quake's epicenter, and toppling dozens of high-rise buildings and multistory apartments to the east in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial heart. The Indian authorities said the earthquake had registered 6.9 on the commonly used scale of magnitude, the strongest here since 1950. But French, Chinese and American seismologists put the measurement between 7.6 and 7.9. That would be about the same magnitude as the severe quake that struck El Salvador on Jan. 13, which measured 7.6. The Indian Air Force began flying blankets, tents, medical supplies and doctors to Bhuj and Ahmedabad, as well as bulldozers, cranes and other heavy equipment that can be used to rescue people from collapsed buildings. The army was also moving about 3,750 troops into the worst-hit areas to set up shelters and aid the rescue.
world,''We have decided to meet the emergency on a war footing,'' Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said in New Delhi, the capital. ''The states which are affected will be given every assistance by the center. This is the time for the people to rally around and fight this calamity.'' Here in Ahmedabad, the earthquake knocked down apartment buildings with a serendipitous abandon. On a quiet residential street in the middle-class neighborhood of Saibag, everything was left standing except for one four-story apartment building that collapsed in a cloud of dust when the earthquake struck. Rajesh Sapra, his wife and two young daughters were among those who poured into the street in their pajamas, fearing they would be buried beneath their own roofs. ''The apartment building collapsed at the moment we ran outside,'' he said. ''We heard people crying.'' When the earth began to move, more people than usual were at home, because it was Republic Day, a national holiday that celebrates the adoption of the Indian Constitution. Many of them were preparing to watch the televised parade in New Delhi that is the nation's annual show of military might. In Saibag, Maj. Nishat Chida was watching television, waiting for a cricket match to start, when his  army barracks started shaking on Friday. Within 15 minutes, he and a team of about 30 soldiers had rushed to the collapsed building and immediately began removing rubble. A crane lifted a huge slab of concrete from the top of the heap and uncovered two sisters who had been lying in bed. The mattress had cushioned the blow, and one survived.
world,Then the soldiers and neighbors heard the cries of a mother and her children, and the sound of them pounding on a metal cabinet. The soldiers managed to break through a wall and pull two brothers to safety. But the mother was still trapped, with another of her sons who had died from a blow to her head. ''She was just crying about her little one who died there on her lap,'' Major Chida said this morning as he gestured to the cave in the rubble where the soldiers had crawled in to get her. ''She was hysterical. She was not willing to come out. She did not want to leave her child.'' As night fell, and the soldiers continued passing huge chunks of debris and metal pots filled with rubble along an assembly line into the street, neighbors brought them steaming cups of tea and coffee and savory vegetable pakoras to keep them going. Finally, after midnight,  the soldiers widened the opening and persuaded the mother to come out with her dead son. Most of Ahmedabad, a bustling city of four to five million people, was still standing and slowly got back to business this morning. More than 350 people died here, but Bhuj bore the full brunt of the quake. About 1,400 people are dead there, said Ramesh Chandra, subinspector of police in the state's emergency control room. More than a dozen aftershocks kept residents, some huddled around bonfires, outside throughout the night in the chill air.
world,Ahmedabad's hospitals were scenes of confusion and heartbreak.  ''Several victims, most of them women and children, with their skulls broken, limbs and backs badly bruised, awaited immediate attention at the same time,'' the Press Trust of India reported. The tremors were felt from Katmandu, Nepal, westward to Karachi, Pakistan, and south to Madras in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. --------------------        When Landmasses Collide (By The New York Times) -- The Indian earthquake and its havoc are rooted in the slow collision of the Indian subcontinent with the Asian landmass. It created the Himalaya Mountains and still causes residual tensions in the Indian tectonic plate that are periodically released in bursts of violent energy. About as fast as fingernails grow, India is moving north, causing earthquakes when rocky plates break apart to relieve the stress. India and all the earth's continents and plates float on a sea of hot, semiliquid rock. The loss of heat from the earth's interior slowly moves them about, rearranging their positions over hundreds of millions of years. The collision and separation of plates produced the continents and their coastlines, and the invisible seams and nearby areas are prone to periodic shaking and destruction.
nyregion,After Bystanders Take Bullets in Midtown, Questions on Police Protocol - The New York Times The encounter was breathtakingly brief: a surveillance video showed a gunman outside the Empire State Building on Friday pulling a pistol, pointing it at two police officers, their firing at him and his falling to the sidewalk. All the yelling and cries of pain occurred out of camera view, just north of where the gunman, Jeffrey T. Johnson, collapsed and died: nine bystanders were struck, cradling bloody arms or lying on the sidewalks and curbs. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, confirmed on Saturday that all nine were wounded by police bullets, bullet fragments or shrapnel from ricochets. Mr. Kelly also confirmed that the shooter, Mr. Johnson, never fired another shot after killing a former co-worker, Steven Ercolino, moments earlier. “We had a witness that said that Johnson fired at the police,” Mr. Kelly said Saturday. “But the final count of the shells, it appears that that is not the case.” It was the second time in two weeks that police officers fired fusillades on the crowded streets of Midtown — 28 shots fired between the two episodes — and with it, there were once again questions of police protocol in urban settings. In the first shooting, no bystanders were struck when officers fired 12 shots at a man with a knife just south of Times Square. The nanosecond speed at which a shooting plays out is followed by hours of analysis, second-guessing and study.
nyregion,There is no national data on how often bystanders are struck by police bullets; Geoffrey P. Alpert, a criminologist at the University of South Carolina and an expert on the police use of force, said that hitting innocent civilians “doesn’t happen very often, but it happens.” He added: “The rule of thumb is that you do not put civilians in the line of fire, but the rule of thumb is also that you don’t let a murderer get away.” In many police shootings, stray shots are almost inevitable; a study based on New York’s annual firearms discharge reports indicated that officers hit their targets 34 percent of the time. “It’s a tense situation, people are scared and moving,” Professor Alpert said. “It’s not like the movies, where you can shoot the gun out of his hand.”  The New York Police Department does include such episodes in its firearms discharge report. In 2010, for example, the police hit three bystanders in a shootout with a gunman; the year before, one bystander was struck when an officer struggled with a suspect who was trying to take his gun, and the gun fired. Those encounters are some of the more trying for officers. “One of the grim realities of police work,” reads a recent annual report, “is the terrible contradiction that can arise when it becomes necessary to protect life by using deadly physical force.” The patrol guide, the department’s manual, states that officers should not fire their weapons when, “in their professional judgment, doing so will unnecessarily endanger innocent persons.”
nyregion,In the shooting in Midtown, Mr. Kelly said on Friday that the two officers “had absolutely no choice.” In Mr. Johnson’s bag, officers found a clip loaded with six rounds, the police said. The courts tend to come down on the side of officers in lawsuits brought from bystanders injured by police bullets. A variety of outcomes after having been struck by a police bullet — physical, psychological, legal — can be found in a gun battle in Harlem in 2005 outside the restaurant Sylvia’s, another New York City landmark. A suspect opened fire on officers, and five of them fired back 25 times, killing him. When it was over, a woman was kneeling in the street over her baby and bleeding from a gunshot wound to the elbow, and a 78-year-old man carrying groceries was stooped to help them. “I got up,” the man, Garnold M. King, recalled in an interview, “and put my hand on my back and said, ‘Oh my God, I was shot too!’ ” The Police Department was sued. One lawsuit, filed by the wounded woman, Tammy Johnson, went all the way to the Court of Appeals before being thrown out in 2010 in a 4-to-3 decision; the majority opinion stated that the officers “clearly had probable cause to fire their weapons at the suspect: they were in pursuit of an armed individual who opened fire on them on a public street, endangering the lives of the officers and the public.” New York City officials say they believe that finding strengthens their position in cases like these.
nyregion,Ms. Johnson, then 39, had been playing with her 17-month-old daughter when she was struck. That moment changed her. She quickly moved to Atlanta. “I didn’t feel safe in New York City anymore,” she said in an interview Friday. Ms. Johnson remained angry at the outcome. “It’s going to take someone to die for them to recognize that it’s not right,” she said. “It made me feel like I’m not important, and neither was my daughter.” There have been times when the city Law Department has chosen to settle cases where the police have shot bystanders. In 2009, according to reports, Wilson Ramos received a $6 million settlement after he was accidentally shot in the head and paralyzed as the police engaged in a gunfight with a robbery suspect. A bystander wounded by an off-duty police officer during a bank robbery in 1978 received a $1.5 million settlement, paid by the city and the bank. Michael A. Cardozo, the city’s corporation counsel, said his office was sympathetic to the injured bystanders but added, “Officers put their lives on the line every day and these officers certainly did that.” He said that he could not discuss how the city would respond if any of those wounded on Friday sued because such cases turn on very specific facts that would have to be analyzed thoroughly. Mr. King, now 85, also sued the police, although he never questioned the action of the officers — perhaps because he was a retired police officer. “If someone’s firing at you, what are you going to do?” he said.
nyregion,Asked why he sued, given his allegiance with the officers, Mr. King said, “I can’t answer you. It’s just one of those things, O.K.? That’s the nature of society today.” He received a $250,000 settlement. “Rich?” he said. “Hell, no.” He thought of the nine people wounded Friday. “Thank God that you’re alive. There’s no way you could have avoided you being where you were at a particular time,” he said. “Whatever religion you are, go to your church and get on your knees and say, ‘Thank you, Jesus. I’m alive.’ ” Of the nine bystanders wounded, at least two remained hospitalized in stable condition on Saturday, Mr. Kelly said. Those who have spoken to reporters expressed relief and, at times, criticism. A sister-in-law of Madia Rosario, one of the wounded, said Saturday of the police, “They needed to be more careful.” Mr. King made a prediction. “Every one of them is going to sue,” he said. “The City of New York has money.”
sports/baseball,At the Plate, the Royals Don’t Miss Much - The New York Times KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Mike Moustakas laughed, softly, an instinctive response from a man who tries to hit baseballs for a living. His team, the Kansas City Royals, tends to struggle against soft-tossing pitchers but handles fastballs well. The Mets, he was reminded, have a hard-throwing rotation. Might that give the Royals an advantage in the World Series? “I guess,” Moustakas said, looking up from his interview table at Kauffman Stadium on Monday. “I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to hit 99 miles an hour. It’s not easy to hit 91 miles an hour when it’s sinking off the table, either. “Never has been, never will be — and making it a little bit harder is guys throwing 99 miles an hour with sinkers, sliders and cutters. We’re going to have to put good at-bats together, try to find ways to score some runs and do what we do.” What the Royals do — better than any other team in the major leagues — is not strike out. That makes them the precise opposites of the Chicago Cubs, whose hitters led the majors in strikeouts. The Mets manhandled the Cubs in the National League Championship Series, never trailing in their four-game sweep. The Royals are a different challenge. Matt Harvey, who will face Edinson Volquez in the World Series Game 1 on Tuesday, struck out nine Cubs in seven and two-thirds innings of the N.L.C.S. opener. Harvey displayed much more than fastball command against the Cubs, and that will be essential again.
sports/baseball,“For us, it’s mixing our pitches and not relying on effective velocity, but going over the scouting reports, finding out what works against this team specifically,” Harvey said. “We knew going into the Cubs series what they were about, and we’ve done our homework here.” The Royals ranked 24th out of 30 teams in homers this season, but the Mets’ Kelly Johnson has seen the damage they can do in October. Johnson played for Baltimore last fall, when the Royals slammed four homers in the first two games of the American League Championship Series en route to a sweep. “I’m not going to go and say they’re just this contact team, because Daniel Murphy was just a contact hitter about two weeks ago,” Johnson said, referring to the Mets’ second baseman, who has homered in a record six postseason games in a row. “You just don’t know what’s going to happen. These guys get big hits; they’ve hit a lot of home runs in this postseason already. They’ve got guys that can do it. You’ve got to treat it like any one of these guys can go deep.” The Royals have 15 homers in 11 games this postseason; the Mets have 14 (half by Murphy) in their nine games. But the Royals have averaged only 6.5 strikeouts per game, compared with 10.4 per game for the Mets. Second baseman Ben Zobrist, who joined Kansas City in a July trade, said he had not thought much about the Royals’ approach until last season, when he faced them with Tampa Bay. The Royals made an indelible impression.
sports/baseball,“It was just a nightmare,” Zobrist said. “We had some great pitchers in Tampa Bay, and they just kind of beat us up. And it wasn’t beating us up with the long ball; they might have hit a few, but every guy’s hitting the ball hard. We’re like, ‘O.K., when’s somebody going to roll over or hit a pop-up or strike out?’ They just keep coming.” The Royals struck out only 973 times this season; the closest team, Atlanta, had 1,107. The trade-off was that their plate appearances tended not to last long. The Royals averaged 3.7 pitches per plate appearance, tied with Miami for the fewest in the majors. Dale Sveum, Kansas City’s hitting coach, said the Royals simply adapted to their spacious ballpark. If they played at a smaller field, like Houston’s or Toronto’s, he guessed, they would hit perhaps 60 more homers. At Kauffman Stadium, a team built on speed can take advantage of wide outfield gaps — but not if it whiffs. “I never saw a strikeout turn into a double,” Sveum said. The Royals’ ability to spoil good pitches by fouling them off tends to be overstated. The team was actually just below the league average in its ratio of foul balls to overall pitches. But as a general rule, the Royals like to swing. They believe it makes no sense to give pitchers free strikes early in the count.
sports/baseball,“We feel the best pitch you’re going to get is the first couple of pitches within the at-bat, so you might as well go up there and try to be aggressive,” first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “With the stuff these guys are featuring nowadays, you can’t afford to put yourself in a hole.” Given how hard the Mets’ starters throw, Hosmer said, you might expect them to attack with fastballs and then snap off a hard two-strike slider. Watching them on video, he said, made him realize the difference. “Especially the last series against Chicago, you can really see that these guys have the ability to pitch backwards,” Hosmer said. “They can throw their off-speed over for strikes, and they can throw their fastball late in the count. I think that’s what makes them a lot tougher is they have the ability to change their game plan based on whatever they want their game plan to be.” The Mets think they can execute any game plan, and Jacob deGrom, who will start Game 2, saw a benefit to facing a free-swinging lineup. “If they put the ball in play early and get out,” he said, “that helps keep me in the game longer.” And that, above all, is what the Mets want in this World Series: as many innings as possible from their dazzling rotation. While the Royals rely heavily on their bullpen, the Mets want Harvey, deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz to stay on the mound until Jeurys Familia comes in for a save. They are confident in their middle relievers, Manager Terry Collins said, but their formula hinges on dominance from their starters and closer.
sports/baseball,“The ideal situation is, tomorrow night, to have Matt hand the ball to Familia,” Collins said. “If we can do that, we’re in good shape.” The Royals will swing, and swing often, to make sure that does not happen.
us/politics,Transcripts Show How Contentious Trump’s Calls Were With Mexican and Australian Leaders - The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump engaged in contentious telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in his early days in office, pressing them to make concessions to satisfy his own domestic political needs in exchanges so sharp that he said talking to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was more pleasant. Transcripts of his calls with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia confirm previous news reports of tension during the conversations in January, just a week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and show a new president eager to fulfill campaign promises while developing relationships with foreign counterparts. The transcripts, assembled from the notes of aides listening to the calls, were obtained by The Washington Post, which posted them online on Thursday morning. With Mr. Peña Nieto, Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to impose a stiff border tax to keep out Mexican products and complained about “pretty tough hombres” who were bringing so many drugs over the border that they had even made New Hampshire “a drug-infested den.” The biggest point of contention came as the president insisted that the Mexican president stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the wall that Mr. Trump had promised to build on the border between the two countries. “If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,” Mr. Trump said.
us/politics,The call with Mr. Turnbull was even more testy as the president complained about what he called “a disgusting deal” that Australia had sealed with President Barack Obama in which the United States agreed to consider accepting up to 1,250 economic refugees. Mr. Trump complained that he would look “so foolish” doing so after barring refugees from the rest of the world. “I have had it,” Mr. Trump snapped toward the end of the call. “I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.” Transcripts of a president’s conversations with foreign leaders are rarely made public, and the disclosure prompted another White House complaint about secrets slipping out. “It’s a national security matter when phone call transcripts are being leaked out,” Lindsay Walters, the White House deputy press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One as Mr. Trump flew to an event in West Virginia. “It prevents the president from being able to do, you know, what he does best and negotiate with foreign leaders.” But the full accounts of the conversations illustrated Mr. Trump’s approach with foreign leaders — flattering his counterpart one moment, badgering him the next, always conscious of how the policies being discussed connected to his campaign promises and how they would affect his domestic political standing.
us/politics,Fresh from his inauguration, he had his campaign victory on his mind, boasting to Mr. Peña Nieto that “no one got people in the rallies as big as I did” and to Mr. Turnbull that “they said I had no way to get to 270” votes in the Electoral College “and I got 306.” He buttered up Mr. Peña Nieto, telling the interpreter on their call that “he speaks better English than me,” suggesting that the Mexican president would be so popular that the Mexican people will amend their constitution to allow him to run again and declaring that “it is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget.” But there was an edge to both conversations as he sought to bring his campaign platform to fruition. The talk with Mr. Peña Nieto on Jan. 27 came after the Mexican leader canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump because of their dispute over who would pay for the proposed border wall. The two never resolved that on the call, with both men clearly worried about the political effect in their own countries. “We find this completely unacceptable for Mexicans to pay for the wall that you are thinking of building,” Mr. Peña Nieto told Mr. Trump, explaining how precarious his position was at home. “I would also like to make you understand, President Trump, the lack of margin I have as president of Mexico to accept this situation.”
us/politics,Mr. Trump too was conscious of his own position: “On the wall, you and I both have political problem. My people stand up and say, ‘Mexico will pay for the wall,’ and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language. But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall. I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period.” Mr. Trump suggested papering over the dispute in public comments: “We should both say, ‘We will work it out.’ It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, ‘We will not pay’ and me saying, ‘We will not pay.’” Mr. Peña Nieto told Mr. Trump that he had put him in a bad position. “You have a very big mark on our back, Mr. President, regarding who pays for the wall,” he said. “This is what I suggest, Mr. President: Let us stop talking about the wall.” He added that he understood that any country had the right to protect its border. “But my position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that Mexico cannot pay for that wall.” “But you cannot say that to the press,” Mr. Trump complained. “The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.”
us/politics,Mr. Peña Nieto repeated that they should stop talking about the wall. “I understand the critical political position that this constitutes for your country and for you, Mr. President,” he said. “Let us look for a creative way to jump over this obstacle.” Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Turnbull the next day, Jan. 28, proved more combative. Mr. Trump said he had been told that he had to accept refugees held by Australia on the islands of Nauru or Manus for more than three years. “Somebody told me yesterday that close to 2,000 people are coming who are really troublesome,” he complained to Mr. Turnbull. “And I am saying, boy that will make us look awfully bad. Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really, it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want and I do not blame you, by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground.” Mr. Turnbull explained that the deal did not require the United States to take 2,000 people but it was important for the United States to live up to its commitment. “This is a big deal,” he said. “I think we should respect deals.” “Who made the deal?” Mr. Trump asked. “Obama?” “Yes,” Mr. Turnbull said, “but let me describe what it is.” The United States had agreed only to consider accepting up to 1,250 refugees, but each of them would be subject to vetting and could be rejected. The people at issue were economic refugees, mainly from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he said, not criminals or terrorists.
us/politics,“Why haven’t you let them out?” Mr. Trump demanded. “Why have you not let them into your society?” “It is not because they are bad people,” Mr. Turnbull said. “It is because in order to stop people-smugglers, we have to deprive them of the product.” Australia by policy, he said, refuses to accept refugees who arrive by boat because it would encourage smugglers to keep charging desperate people to bring them there. “That is a good idea,” Mr. Trump said. “We should do that too. You are worse than I am.” Mr. Turnbull implored the president to abide by the agreement. “I am asking you as a very good friend. This is a big deal. It is really, really important to us that we maintain it.” “Malcolm, why is this so important?” Mr. Trump said. “I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.” Going along with the deal “puts me in a bad position.” He added, “It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.” Mr. Turnbull repeated that it was only 1,250 people, each of them subject to vetting. “I will be honest with you, I hate taking these people,” Mr. Trump said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.”
us/politics,“I would not be so sure about that,” Mr. Turnbull said. “Well, maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because Obama made a bad deal.” “But I can say to you, there is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,” Mr. Turnbull said. “This is a stupid deal,” Mr. Trump said. “This deal will make me look terrible.” “Mr. President, I think this will make you look like a man who stands by the commitments of the United States.” Mr. Trump was not buying it. “O.K., this shows me to be a dope,” he said. “I am not like this but if I have to do it, I will do it, but I do not like this at all.” He said that he worried that the terrorists like those who killed Americans in Boston, San Bernardino and New York could be admitted to the country: “I am going to get killed on this thing.” “You will not,” Mr. Turnbull insisted. “Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.”

business/dealbook,DeVos Halts Obama-Era Plan to Revamp Student Loan Management - The New York Times With the stroke of a pen this week, Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s new education secretary, thrust the future of the government’s system for managing federal student loans into confusion. It was a high-stakes move: Her department administers $1.3 trillion in loans on behalf of nearly 43 million student borrowers. At issue is which companies will handle the bulk of those loans in the future, and how they will do it. Under the Obama administration, the Education Department was on the verge of selecting a single vendor to build a new system for servicing its student loans, in what was expected to be one of the largest federal contracts outside of the military. But on Tuesday, Ms. DeVos signed an order rescinding key parts of that attempt to streamline the system — essentially hitting the reset button on the Obama-era plan. “The guidance from the last administration resulted in a process that involved moving deadlines, changing requirements and a lack of consistent objectives,” the Education Department said in a statement. It did not specify what changes — if any — it might make to the program. The government has for years relied on a patchwork of nine loan servicing companies to send bills to borrowers, collect their payments and handle any problems that arise. Complaints about slipshod service are rampant. A study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that borrowers with all of the major servicers “encounter widespread problems” at nearly every stage of the process.
business/dealbook,The Obama administration sought to replace this labyrinthine system with a single entry point — a sea change in how student loan servicing would work. Instead of dealing directly with private vendors, all federal borrowers would gain access to their accounts through an Education Department portal, with standardized forms and processes. A single vendor would take the lead in creating the system’s interface; others would play behind-the-scenes roles, fielding phone calls and handling other customer-service tasks. The plan, hashed out for years and dangling a rich contract, represented a golden opportunity for the student loan industry. Last April, the Education Department opened bidding to find a vendor to build that system, and the winner would get a chance to construct the most visible government portal since HealthCare.gov. In October, the government narrowed the field to three finalists: Navient; the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (better known as FedLoan); and two companies, Nelnet and Great Lakes, that submitted a joint proposal. The winner was to be announced in February. But the change in administrations and a legal challenge from FedLoan, over issues that were not disclosed, delayed that timeline. Then on Tuesday, Ms. DeVos cast doubt on the entire project, raising the question of whether the department she runs will scrap the idea of a single portal. “I am not convinced that the new administration wants to continue going down this path at all,” said Michael Tarkan, an analyst with Compass Point, a research firm.
business/dealbook,Both strategies — sticking with the current system, or constructing an entirely new one — have risks. The status quo is hardly ideal. Borrowers frequently complain about opaque, sloppy and bungled service from the companies hired to collect their payments. Navient is the biggest lightning rod. In January, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and two state attorneys general sued Navient, charging it with a long list of misdeeds. Navient has denied all wrongdoing and is fighting the lawsuits. But constructing a single system that can successfully handle inquiries and phone calls from millions of borrowers, many of them with complicated needs, is also perilous. The government’s last effort along those lines, HealthCare.gov, was a disaster when it went live and required months to iron out the kinks. And the National Council of Higher Education Resources, an industry trade group, said the procurement process for the new system had been a mess. This month, it wrote to members of Congress to urge that the contract award be delayed and entirely rethought. “The department has failed to answer how this new centralized system will provide better services to student and parent borrowers,” it wrote. “The prescriptive nature of the procurement may actually increase delinquencies and defaults.” Navient, Nelnet, Great Lakes and FedLoan all declined to comment because the bid process is continuing. A ruling on FedLoan’s challenge is expected next week. The department could opt to abandon plans for the new system and leave in place its current approach of farming out loan servicing to a variety of vendors, each with its own tactics. Those contracts expire in 2019.
business/dealbook,But critics of Ms. DeVos’s move this week are especially concerned about a particular piece of guidance from the Obama administration she struck down: that the Education Department should place great weight on a company’s track record when selecting student loan vendors, and should steer away from companies with histories of shoddy service or other problems. Essentially, that puts Navient — the nation’s largest federal student loan servicer, which faces a spate of regulatory and legal problems related to its business practices — on stronger footing than it had been in bidding for agency contracts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau responded to Ms. DeVos’s memo with a pointed note saying that borrowers “should be able to repay their debt without having to deal with illegal loan servicing practices.” If the department does go forward with a single portal, Ms. DeVos’s memo seems to improve Navient’s shot at winning the bid, according to procurement experts. In one of the memos rejected by Ms. DeVos, her predecessor as education secretary, John B. King Jr., said that a company’s past performance should be “the most important noncost factor.” Analysts interpreted that as a signal that Navient’s track record would hamper its bid. With those priorities now scrapped, the company is back in the running, said Rohit Chopra, a former student loan ombudsman with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who also briefly worked for the Education Department.
business/dealbook,Mr. Tarkan of Compass Point agreed. He previously considered the joint bid of Nelnet and Great Lakes the front-runner, but Navient’s size makes it a very strong competitor — once past performance is played down. For students, the decision is about more than just what company name appears on their monthly statement. The loan servicer has tremendous power to guide them through repayment options. Some plans stretch payment periods out for as long as 30 years, and others help qualifying students get a portion of their debt forgiven. Strategic use of those paths can trim — or inflate — the sum that a student ultimately pays by tens of thousands of dollars. Curtis Pyle, 36, of Aurora, Ill., said he wrangled for months with his servicer, Great Lakes, over the details of his income-based repayment plan and how his earnings should be calculated. Last year, when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau solicited public comments on a new, streamlined form the government was considering to help borrowers understand their repayment options, he wrote to enthusiastically support the plan. As it stands now, he said, “it’s like a maze.”
us/politics,Republicans Divided Between Romney and Giuliani for Secretary of State - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Rival factions of Republicans are locked in an increasingly caustic and public battle to influence President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice for secretary of state, leaving a prominent hole in an otherwise quickly formed national security team that is unlikely to be filled until next week at the earliest. The debate inside Mr. Trump’s wide circle of formal and informal advisers — pitting supporters of one leading contender, Mitt Romney, against those of another, Rudolph W. Giuliani — has led to the kind of dramatic airing of differences that characterized Mr. Trump’s unconventional and often squabbling campaign team. And it traces the outlines of the enduring split in the Republican Party between establishment figures who scoffed at Mr. Trump’s chances of victory and the grass-roots insurgents who backed him as a disrupter of the Washington power structure. The most publicly vocal faction has been the group opposed to Mr. Romney, which has questioned whether he would be loyal after his searing criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign. But Mr. Trump himself has told aides that he believes Mr. Romney “looks the part” and would make a fine secretary of state, a senior Trump official said on Thursday. Mr. Trump, who is always difficult to read and is capable of changing his mind at any minute, has also praised Mr. Giuliani in recent conversations with acquaintances.
us/politics,Even Thanksgiving did not provide a reprieve from the extraordinary public efforts to cast doubt on Mr. Romney. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said on Twitter that she had received “a deluge” of concern from people warning against picking Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor. Those raising concerns about Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an early and loyal supporter of Mr. Trump, have said they fear that his tangle of foreign business ties could lead to a damaging confirmation battle. They also worry that Mr. Giuliani lacks the vigor for the globe-trotting job. Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani have made their interest in the role known to Mr. Trump. But while Mr. Giuliani has been very public about his intentions — angering Mr. Trump at times with his statements — Mr. Romney has been more reserved. The split over the two men has opened the door for another candidate altogether. One potential pick Mr. Trump and his team have entertained is Gen. John F. Kelly of the Marines, a former head of the United States Southern Command. Others are David H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C.I.A. director, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, according to two people involved in the process. Asked about Mr. Trump’s deliberations, a spokesman, Jason Miller, said in an email Thursday, “The president-elect is meeting with a number of well-qualified potential selections for this important position who share his America First foreign policy — some of whom have been made public and others who have not — and the president-elect will make public his decision when he has finalized it.”
us/politics,Mr. Romney would represent a departure from the hard-liners Mr. Trump has already picked for his national security team. But aides like Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, have expressed doubts about Mr. Romney’s loyalty given his denunciation of Mr. Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud.” Mr. Bannon and others have told colleagues they fear that a State Department under Mr. Romney could turn into something of a rogue agency. Asked to explain her Twitter post about Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway said that while she trusted Mr. Trump’s judgment, she found it notable that the most outrage directed at Mr. Trump from the party’s grass-roots “is not against something he said, but something he may do.” In another post, she said that being “loyal” was an important characteristic for a secretary of state. Others hoping to catch Mr. Trump’s ear have taken their message to a place they know he is likely to absorb it: cable news. Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, who has spoken with Mr. Trump about his concerns that Mr. Giuliani would not be confirmed by the Senate, has taken to making those arguments on a daily basis on his morning show, which he knows Mr. Trump watches. Others, like Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, have gone on television to try to dissuade Mr. Trump from picking Mr. Romney. Mr. Huckabee, who said during the 2008 presidential campaign that Mr. Romney reminded voters of “the guy who laid them off,” told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Mr. Romney would be “a real insult” to Mr. Trump’s supporters. Mr. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republican voters who turned out in large numbers to lift Mr. Trump to victory.
us/politics,Sean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Mr. Trump often privately solicits, has also been deeply critical of Mr. Romney on his show. Shortly after the election, Mr. Giuliani told associates that he believed the job was his. He had communicated to Mr. Trump’s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions. But he began to run afoul of Mr. Trump when he told a Wall Street Journal forum that he would probably be a better candidate than John R. Bolton, who served as one of George W. Bush’s ambassadors to the United Nations. And when reports surfaced about Mr. Giuliani’s foreign business entanglements and highly compensated speechmaking, Mr. Trump grew even warier. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. As a backup plan, some of Mr. Trump’s aides encouraged him to meet with Mr. Romney. Though some in Mr. Trump’s inner circle, like Reince Priebus, his choice for chief of staff, thought that such a meeting would anger the president-elect’s supporters, Mr. Trump went ahead. In the meantime, he started sounding out Mr. Giuliani on a different post, director of national intelligence. Mr. Trump’s advisers have discussed the role for Mr. Giuliani, but there has been no indication he wants it.
us/politics,What many people believed would be a perfunctory meeting with Mr. Romney last weekend at Mr. Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., turned into something more substantial. Mr. Trump liked Mr. Romney quite a bit, and was intrigued by the possibility of such a camera-ready option to represent the country around the globe, advisers to Mr. Trump said. The following day, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump and urged him to make a decision in one direction or the other. Mr. Romney, who was mocked in 2012 when he described Russia as the greatest geopolitical foe of the United States, has seen his stock in the Republican Party rise since his loss to President Obama, although he is still viewed skeptically by the party’s grass-roots. His allies believe that his position on Russia has been vindicated, but it is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump’s stated desire for a better relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Privately, Mr. Giuliani has expressed his frustration at going from front-runner for secretary of state to a contender who has to convince Mr. Trump of his strengths. He is particularly irritated over the focus on his business ties. The option of a third person like General Kelly has gained currency in recent days inside the transition team. A respected leader, General Kelly served as the senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. He led the Southern Command, responsible for all United States military activities in South and Central America, for four years under Mr. Obama. And his appointment would fit Mr. Trump’s inclination toward putting people with combat experience in senior foreign policy roles.
realestate,The Best and Worst Places for Retirement - The New York Times Where is the best place to retire in the United States? It’s complicated. While New York may offer the best quality of life for retirees, it’s too pricey for many. Alabama may be one of the cheapest places to live, but the quality of health care there leaves a lot to be desired. And while Minnesota may offer the best health care — and a quality of life second only to that in New York — it is also very expensive. These are among the findings of a recent study by the financial website WalletHub, which ranked the 50 states and the District of Columbia in three categories: affordability, health care and general quality of life. Using 31 metrics and assigning a point value to each, the site then came up with an overall score for each state. Here are the five that ranked best — and the five that ranked the worst.
sports/baseball,Indians Prospect Aims for a Streak Made Famous by Joe DiMaggio - The New York Times WOODBRIDGE, Va. — Francisco Mejia stepped out of the clubhouse and into the dugout with little fanfare. He did his usual turns in the batting cage, and the 5-foot-10, 175-pound catcher looked like just another 20-year-old in the minors. Yet Mejia is something of a modern-day Joe DiMaggio, plying his trade for the Lynchburg Hillcats of the high Class A Carolina League. The Cleveland Indians prospect went into the weekend with a 48-game hitting streak that ranked as the eighth longest in pro baseball history and the best since 1954. Mejia has had a hit in every game he has played in since May 25, a string that dates to his time with the Lake County Captains of the low Class A Midwest League. Neither Lynchburg Manager Mark Budzinski nor the team’s hitting coach, Larry Day, has had a single conversation with Mejia about the streak, which stands out because of Mejia’s age, his role as a catcher and the distractions he has faced along the way. As one of Cleveland’s top 10 prospects, he took part in the Major League Baseball All-Star Futures Game in San Diego and would have gone to the Milwaukee Brewers at the trade deadline last month had the deal for Jonathan Lucroy been completed.
sports/baseball,“It has not been easy for him,” said Carter Hawkins, the Indians’ director of player development. “This has not been put on a silver platter. He’s moved levels, he’s traveled around to different All-Star Games, he’s been a name that came up in trade rumors. There have certainly been a lot of different reasons or potential excuses to end this streak, but I think just focusing on his work and focusing on what he can do and what he can control has really helped him out.” In the meantime, Mejia has moved closer to the record 69-game hit streak by Joe Wilhoit of the Western League in 1919. DiMaggio owns the streak that most fans know about, the major league mark of 56 games in 1941 for the Yankees. Many fans do not realize that DiMaggio also owns the second-longest hitting streak in pro ball — as a teenager in 1933, DiMaggio hit in 61 straight games for the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League. Budzinski said Mejia, who was signed out of the Dominican Republic at 16, reminded him of a young switch-hitting Vladimir Guerrero, without the power, because of his ability to hit the ball so effectively out of the strike zone. An aggressive hitter, he does not walk much. It is no coincidence that after the organization decided to make him repeat a year in the Midwest League. Mejia changed aspects of his game as varied as his body language and his preparation.
sports/baseball,“This year, I got a better approach, better routines,” Mejia said. “I got routines this year.” It has paid off. Mejia’s batting average improved from .243 in 2015 to .348 this season, which Day credits to an improved all-field approach, especially when he is batting left-handed. Previously, Mejia, who throws right-handed, pulled from that side of the plate and cut off half of the field. Now he is hitting the ball everywhere. “It’s his gifted hand-eye coordination ability to put the barrel of the bat on the ball,” Budzinski said Thursday before a road game against the Potomac Nationals. “The guys that are a little more aggressive and can hit the ball out of the zone hard, which he can do — that’s where you tend to see guys that can extend those hit streaks longer.” The streak is even more remarkable because of Mejia’s catching responsibilities. The longest hitting streak by a catcher is 49, set by Harry Chozen in the Southern Association in 1954. “He doesn’t make it about him,” Day said. “These games are not being played to see if he will or will not extend his hitting streak and he doesn’t act that way. He plays to win. He hits to win. He prepares to win.”
sports/baseball,When M.L.B. Broke the Ice With a Game in Havana - The New York Times On Tuesday afternoon, the Tampa Bay Rays will play an exhibition game against the Cuban national baseball team in Havana. The moment will surely stand out, but it will not be nearly as groundbreaking as the game the Baltimore Orioles played there 17 years ago. That game occurred on March 28, 1999, at a time when the United States’ embargo against Cuba made American business ventures in Cuba virtually impossible. Peter Angelos, the owner of the Orioles, was a strong critic of the economic blockade of the island nation, however, and sought to foster improved relations between the countries through baseball. He had previously been denied requests to take his team to Cuba, but when President Bill Clinton announced an easing of travel restrictions, Angelos, a Clinton donor, appealed again and was granted permission to pursue his idea. Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, appointed Sandy Alderson, now the Mets’ general manager but then one of his key deputies, as his point man. Alderson, Angelos and a small contingent of other baseball officials went to Cuba in early March to lay the groundwork for the trip. Weeks later, the Orioles played the Cuban national team, the first time a major league club had been in Cuba in 40 years. Five weeks later, there was a rematch in Baltimore. In recent interviews, participants in those games looked back, often with a little bit of wonderment at what occurred.
sports/baseball,The Genesis PETER ANGELOS, the Orioles’ owner: “I always felt the embargo was a mistake and it did not work. In my mind, it was unfortunate and never should have happened. So I felt we had to put all that aside and re-establish the dialogue. I felt the two countries could get together and put behind their differences, and what better way to start than through baseball, the national sport of both countries?” SANDY ALDERSON, baseball’s point man in the talks with Cuba: “I don’t think M.L.B. would have done it without Peter really pushing it. It ended up costing him a lot of money because he had to cover all the losses.” BRADY ANDERSON, one of the Orioles’ top players at the time: “I was for it. I wanted to go play the Cuban team. I had always dreamed of playing internationally, but I never had the chance to play in the Olympics. I knew it was going to be historic, interesting and unprecedented.” The Final Approvals The Orioles and Major League Baseball needed permission from the United States government before any game could take place. Both Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, weighed in on the matter. ALDERSON “What I recall was most fascinating was all the preliminary work, the advance work both in Washington and Havana. We went to the White House and talked with Sandy Berger, who was the national security adviser at the time. We went to the State Department.
sports/baseball,“We didn’t have to talk anyone into it, but there were clearly different elements of the government with different points of view. It was President Clinton and Peter Angelos who kind of rammed it through. “The big issue was, what is going to happen to the revenue? Will it end up benefiting the Castro government? I kept saying, There isn’t going to be any revenue because of the cost of the television production, the cost of transporting the players and the upgrade of the stadium and all the accommodations and so forth. And I heard that the average ticket price for the game was, like, 10 cents. Unfortunately, most of the attendees were probably party officials.” Preparations For Game 1 ALDERSON “ESPN had already committed its schedule for the day we were considering. I remember they were willing to clear their schedule, but they weren’t willing to pay for anything, including the cost of the production, which I believe included bringing the equipment in from Florida. “There were things that we were prohibited from bringing in that had to be brought from Canada; outfield padding, for instance. The whole stadium had to be upgraded, the turf, the dirt infield. “Because of the sanctions, you couldn’t bring in anything that was going to stay in the country. Everything you brought in had to stay with you, or if it stayed in Cuba, it had to be licensed or come from a third country. So a lot of the supplies, especially the groundskeeping equipment and supplies, came from Canada.”
sports/baseball,Cuba Prepares, Too DANILO VALIENTE, now a Yankees coach, then the third-base coach for the Cuban national team (he spoke last week through an interpreter): “Before the game, we were worried because in our league, we don’t use wooden bats. We only had about 10 to 15 days to practice with wooden bats. There were a lot of expectations for us from the fans. They wanted us to do good and show our talent. “Eventually we got used to it, but at the beginning, we broke a lot of bats.” PETER SCHMUCK, a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, who accompanied the first delegation to Cuba: “In order to get on the plane, I had to be listed as a special assistant to the owner, because the Cubans would not allow journalists. But they weren’t fooled. When we got there, a Cuban official came up to me and said, ‘Welcome, Peter Schmuck, special assistant to Peter Angelos and reporter for The Baltimore Sun.’ ” The Americans Arrive,  March 27, 1999 ANDERSON “I remember the smell of the country. It smelled good, if that doesn’t sound too strange. It smelled like burnt orange peels.” ANGELOS “We landed in a darkened airport. We were coming in on a commercial flight, but they cleared us to land. Everything was dark. There was a bus there and an official from the Cuban government welcomed us very heartily, and we got on a bus and drove into Havana.
sports/baseball,“What we witnessed was the capital of Cuba that was literally crumbling in the dust from the embargo that we had imposed upon the country.” ALDERSON “There were some hard-liners in their government who weren’t terribly thrilled with the whole idea. So, not everyone was happy to see the Americanos. “There were a lot of intermediaries and translators. People were constantly saying, ‘The room is bugged.’ It was like the Cold War. We had people pass us notes to take to the United States.” The State Dinner The night before the game, Cuba’s president, Fidel Castro, hosted a state dinner. His brother Raul was there, too. BUD SELIG, baseball’s commissioner at the time: “We got to the hotel and my wife said to me, ‘I want to see downtown Havana on a Saturday night.’ The phone rang in our room and everything reminded me of my days in the 1950s because of what you saw, whether it was phones, hotels, cars, everything. This voice on the other end said, ‘Palace, 7 o’clock.’ I said to my wife, ‘We’ll stay there for 15 or 20 minutes, meet him and then go.’ We get there and after about 45 minutes, in comes Fidel dressed exactly as you had seen him for 40 years. He invited us to stay for dinner. “We didn’t leave until 3 o’clock in the morning. I could tell you it was a seven-course meal, but it might have been a 27-course meal; I lost track. There was a lot of conversation. It was a remarkable experience.”
sports/baseball,ANGELOS “We had a great time meeting with him and talking about the problems that we were both confronted with. We Americans, at least I did, felt we should get back together again, and he seemed very willing and eager to talk about that, although I told him clearly that I had no authority to discuss that. It was just a personal opinion. “A number of owners came along with us. They had an absolute first-rate state dinner with Fidel. Raul was there, and it was very cordial, very nice and very positive. It was confirming what I was hoping for. The assumption that we could not get together was simply not a correct assessment.” ALDERSON “A bunch of other owners flew in on their own. We kept saying, ‘You guys cannot fly in on your private planes,’ but they did anyway. “We had the dinner with Castro. This guy is a historical figure, so it was interesting to meet him. Through his interpreter, the thing he wanted to know about was the baseball academies in the Dominican Republic. You could tell he was interested in the possibility of doing it there. “I recall him saying that he was a better basketball player than baseball player, that a lot of the baseball stuff was apocryphal.” The Protests A number of Cuban-born players and coaches, as well as some American politicians, opposed the trip on the grounds that it would strengthen Fidel Castro’s regime. Cookie Rojas was the third-base coach of the Mets at the time. Bobby Valentine was the manager of the Mets, and Rey Ordonez, a Cuban defector, was the team’s shortstop. The Cuban-born Rafael Palmeiro was the Orioles’ designated hitter.
sports/baseball,COOKIE ROJAS “I strongly disagreed with the decision because I did not want anything to support Castro. I thought it was a bad idea, so I decided to sit out in protest. I talked to Bobby Valentine and told him my feelings, and he said he respected my position and that he understood. Rey Ordonez did the same thing.” ANDERSON “I understood the protests. Rafael Palmeiro didn’t go. It was a very polarizing issue, and it still is. But it was an attempt by a very forward-thinking owner, using baseball as a way to bridge a divide between two countries and normalize relations.” ANGELOS “I thought there could be some kind of reaction because Castro was characterized as a communist and in all kinds of negative ways.” The Game The Orioles beat Cuba, 3-2. Jose Contreras, who later defected to the United States, pitched eight scoreless innings in relief for Cuba, allowing only two hits and striking out 10. Cuba tied the score in the eighth inning on a run-scoring single by Omar Linares, and Harold Baines put the Orioles ahead for good with a base hit for the Orioles in the 11th. ALDERSON “The Cubans should have won that game, as I recall.” SELIG “The atmosphere was very festive. I told my wife, ‘I will sit with you and Peter.’ But this young assistant came over and he said that Fidel would like us to sit with him. I told my wife, ‘You just got dumped for Fidel.’ So, that’s where I sat, and I got a lot of mail from South Florida, which wasn’t very pleasant. But it was obvious to me the guy loved baseball.”
sports/baseball,ROJAS “I did not watch. I had no interest whatsoever.” ANDERSON “We were there for a purpose. Baseball was a device to help foster good relations between two countries. But once the game started, it was all baseball. Your mind-set was no longer on the political ramifications. You were just concentrating on winning the game.” ANGELOS “When ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ was played, along with the Cuban anthem, Fidel stood up. There was no problem.” VALIENTE “The ballpark was completely full and the fans were very excited, jumping up and down, cheering. Eighth inning, runner on, Linares hit a ground-ball base hit and we tie the score, 2-2. I was jumping up and down, I was so excited. Unfortunately, we lost in the 11th.” ANDERSON “Contreras stood out. He clearly had major league stuff.” The Postgame Spread SELIG “When the game is over, we go back and they put on a wonderful buffet.” ANDERSON “Alberto Juantorena was there. He is the only guy to win the gold in the 400 and 800 meters at the Olympics. If you knew anything about track and field, you knew who he was. I was always a huge track and field guy and I still am, so I was thrilled to meet him.” The Departure SELIG “We had a little trouble getting out of Cuba. I have no idea what it was, but we got held at the airport. No one ever said what it was, but we waited a while and I was getting very restless, as I normally do. But we eventually got out of there.”
sports/baseball,The Cubans Win in Baltimore On May 3, 1999, the Cubans traveled to Camden Yards in Baltimore for the return leg of the series and won, 12-6. The Cubans had planned to stay the night and leave the next day, but they mobilized their party ahead of schedule, presumably to thwart possible defections. One former player, who had become a team coach, did defect, and six others from the delegation, none of them players, missed the hastily arranged flight. But they returned home soon after. ALDERSON “They were going to play the game that night in Baltimore and they were going to fly out the next morning. But they were so worried about defections that they decided to fly out that night after the game. They took people straight from the ballpark and rousted people out of the hotel and took off into the night, and they left about seven or eight people that they missed at the hotel. One of them defected.” VALIENTE “I really wanted to make the trip to Baltimore, but I could not get my visa. I was very sad.” Postscript to the Series ANGELOS “I sent Castro an Oriole jacket with the No. 1 on it. He is a very committed baseball fan, and he could talk baseball like the professionals. I contacted him that way, and I would get messages from his local people in Washington, Why don’t you come down again to Cuba?
sports/baseball,“That was 1999. I am thankful that it has finally happened again, but that was what, 17 years ago? I didn’t think it would take this long.” SELIG “I would like to think that it was an early precursor of what we have today. I thought it would happen sooner, but it didn’t. It was, obviously, a very sensitive political issue. But I’m delighted it is happening now.” ALDERSON “It was a lot of fun. It was exciting. I was sitting behind home plate with the commissioner and Castro was there sitting next to the commissioner. I was wearing a Baltimore Orioles cap, which I felt uneasy wearing, since I had been with Oakland for so long.” SCHMUCK “Being there and meeting the people, it changed my view of the embargo.” VALIENTE “We had a good understanding of how big it would be, but we did not have a lot of information. We sensed that it would be very big for Cuban sports. We thought we would have an opportunity to get to know each other, the players. But it did not really happen. We didn’t have much interaction.” ANDERSON “Our owner was really forward-thinking. I mean, you see what’s going on today. He was 17 years ahead of the curve.” ROJAS “Time cures everything.” ANGELOS “Thanks for calling. It brings back some pleasant memories.”
us/politics,Republicans in Congress Plan Swift Action on Agenda With Donald Trump - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans, stunned by their own good, if complicated, fortune, said on Wednesday that they would move quickly next year on an agenda that merges with President-elect Donald J. Trump’s, repealing the Affordable Care Act, cutting taxes, confirming conservative judges, shrinking government programs and rolling back regulations. Like much of the nation, groggy Republicans were still trying to process results that were the opposite of what most had anticipated. Many Republicans in the House and Senate largely avoided Mr. Trump during his campaign, while a handful outright denounced him, largely to their peril. In the Senate, two incumbents and one Republican challenger who rejected Mr. Trump lost. Republicans appeared likely to secure a 52-to-48 majority in the Senate. Mr. Trump’s victory provides what Republicans have been seeking for a decade: unified control of the government and a chance to pursue a conservative agenda, transforming them from the “party of no” into a party that can enact significant legislation. And on Wednesday, congressional leaders said major parts of their agenda could get to the new president’s desk quickly. “The goal would be to try and get on the same page,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader — who was about as close as the taciturn leader comes to giddy — said as he celebrated the Republican victories at the Capitol.
us/politics,“We’re going to be an enthusiastic supporter almost all the time,” he said of Mr. Trump. “When we have differences of opinion, I prefer that we work them out in private.” President Obama’s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, was clearly in Republicans’ sights. “This health care law is collapsing of its own weight,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said from Wisconsin, adding that Congress had already shown it could  get a repeal bill to the president’s desk without any Democratic help. Republicans are widely believed to favor a maneuver used in budgeting that would allow them to undo the law without facing a Democratic filibuster. Mr. McConnell demurred Wednesday on the process, but said repealing the law, which has provided health care coverage for 20 million people, is “pretty high on our agenda,” adding, “I would be shocked if we didn’t move forward and keep our commitment to the American people.” Other issues that converge with the new president’s include the confirmation of a conservative Supreme Court justice to fill a vacancy from the death of Antonin Scalia early this year, the reduction of climate and other regulations on businesses and Wall Street, and the diminution of the role of the federal government in an array of policy areas like education. But other priorities are far from shared. Mr. Trump spent his campaign deriding many of the cornerstone principles of his party: free trade, changes in Social Security and the United States’ posture toward Russia.
us/politics,“It’s just our constitutional duty to keep the executive branch in check,” Senator-elect Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, said Wednesday. Mr. Trump also agrees with Republicans on sharp tax cuts for businesses and most American households, especially the wealthiest. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that Mr. Trump’s plan would cut federal revenue by $6.2 trillion over the next decade. Mr. McConnell said Wednesday that Republicans craved comprehensive tax reform, an area where Democrats and Republicans remained deeply divided. Mr. McConnell, who took a political risk that paid off when he refused to act for eight months on Mr. Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, said he looked forward to advising Mr. Trump on a nominee, but would not say whether Republicans would invoke a rules change to prevent Democrats from filibustering Mr. Trump’s choice. However, he hinted that they would avoid doing so, saying that majorities should not “overreach” after a big election win. “I think it’s always a mistake to misread your mandate,” Mr. McConnell said. “I don’t think we should act as if we’re going to be in power forever.” Mr. Trump has been more impulsive than ideological in his policy goals. He has at times provided scant details, and at others reversed or greatly scaled back his stated goals, such as barring  Muslims from entering the country. Mr. Trump could work with Democrats in some areas, such as repealing carried interest deductions that benefit some investors, an action most Republicans oppose.
us/politics,And he would like to invest in the nation’s highways,  bridges and other infrastructure, a goal Democrats and Republicans share, though the parties do not agree on how to pay for a large-scale public works package. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, called Mr. Trump on Wednesday to push for a “robust infrastructure jobs bill.” On this front, Mr. Trump could conceivably work with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the presumed incoming Democratic leader, who said he had already talked to Mr. Trump. “It is time for the country to come together and heal the bitter wounds from the campaign,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. The biggest question going into the next Congress will be how Mr. Trump deals with Mr. Ryan, a frequent critic during the campaign. Mr. Trump often returned fire, notably when Mr. Ryan said he could no longer defend Mr. Trump’s more incendiary remarks and disinvited him from a campaign swing in Wisconsin. But in Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump has a built-in policy factory with a largely supportive caucus; if he signals his support for Mr. Ryan, if not all of his ideas, the two could probably forge a path forward. “Nothing unites a political party more than a big win,” said John Feehery, a former top Republican congressional aide. “I expect G.O.P. leaders to work closely with the new Trump administration. They don’t have much of a choice at this juncture.”
us/politics,Vice President-elect Mike Pence is also expected to be a bridge between the White House and Capitol Hill, and Mr. McConnell said he expected him to take on a role similar to that of former Vice President Dick Cheney, possibly attending weekly lunches with the Republican conference. Beyond Washington, Tuesday was a good night for Republicans generally. The party held onto the House with few losses, and made moderate gains at the state level, adding to the broad control it has been building in the states since 2010. While Democrats had hoped the election would be a chance to start retaking ground in the states and Mr. Obama had directly worked on behalf of more than 150 local Democrats, Republicans gained at least three new governor’s offices on Tuesday. It was unclear whether they would hold on to the governor’s office in North Carolina, where final results were not expected until later this month. In state legislatures, where Democrats had seen more opportunities, Republicans, who effectively controlled 68 of 99 chambers before Election Day, gained control of at least the Kentucky House and the Iowa Senate. With votes in some states still being counted on Wednesday, Democrats did take some chambers, but the scope of wins was nowhere near as large as they had hoped; they took control of the New Mexico House and both chambers in Nevada.
world/asia,North Korea Says Diplomat Who Defected Is ‘Human Scum’ - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Saturday that a diplomat in its London embassy who recently defected to South Korea had fled rather than face punishment for various crimes, calling him “human scum.” The statement, from the official Korean Central News Agency, was North Korea’s first reaction to the defection of Thae Yong-ho, its most senior official to defect in almost two decades. The defection of Mr. Thae, who was the No. 2 diplomat in the embassy, was announced by South Korea on Wednesday. The North Korean statement said Mr. Thae, whom it did not identify by name, had been ordered in June to return from Britain to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, because he had embezzled state funds, sold official secrets and sexually assaulted a minor. The statement offered no evidence for those accusations. Rather than return home, the statement said, Mr. Thae “proved himself to be human scum who betrayed the fatherland” by fleeing. It said that North Korea had informed the British government of the accusations against Mr. Thae and asked that he be handed over to North Korean officials, but that London had instead created an “indelible stain” in relations between the countries by letting him go to South Korea, to be used in a “smear campaign” against the North.
world/asia,South Korea has not explained how or when Mr. Thae made his way to the country with his wife and children, and the North Korean statement suggested that he had been in British custody beforehand. There was no immediate response from the British or South Korean government. North Korea has typically referred to its defectors as “scum” or “traitors,” often accusing South Korea’s intelligence agency of kidnapping them. On Friday, Jeong Joon-hee, a South Korean government spokesman, said he expected the North to react similarly to Mr. Thae’s defection. Doing otherwise “would be tantamount to admitting to the inferiority of its own regime,” he said. The South has said that Mr. Thae defected out of disillusionment with the North Korean government, and that his decision to flee was a sign that such sentiments were spreading among the North Korean elite.
world/europe,Cables Show U.S. Pressed Germany on C.I.A. Case - The New York Times BERLIN — American officials exerted sustained pressure on Germany not to enforce arrest warrants against Central Intelligence Agency officers involved in the 2003 kidnapping of a German citizen mistakenly believed to be a terrorist, diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks show. John M. Koenig, the American deputy chief of mission in Berlin, issued a pointed warning in February 2007 urging that Germany “weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.” in the case of Khaled el-Masri, a German of Lebanese descent. Mr. Masri said he was held in a secret United States prison in Afghanistan and tortured before his captors acknowledged their mistake and let him go. The United States’ concern over the Masri case was detailed in cables sent from the United States Embassies in Germany, Spain and Macedonia in 2006 and 2007. The cables indicated what was long suspected by German opposition leaders who led a parliamentary inquiry into the case: intense political pressure from Washington was the reason that Germany never pressed for the arrest and extradition of 13 operatives believed to be from the C.I.A. who were ultimately charged in indictments issued in Spain and in Munich. “I am not surprised by this,” said Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green bloc in Parliament who then sat on the legislative investigative committee. “It was confirmed once again that the U.S. government kept the German government” from seeking the arrest of the agents.
world/europe,In one cable, written before Mr. Koenig’s warning to Germany’s deputy national security adviser, the embassy in Berlin reported that diplomatic officials had “continued to stress with German counterparts the potential negative implications for our bilateral relationship, and in particular for our counter-terrorism cooperation, if further steps are taken to seek the arrest or extradition of U.S. citizens/officials.” In 2006 and 2007, the Masri case was one of the most difficult issues between Washington and Berlin, exposing to public scrutiny secret tactics used in the Bush administration’s antiterrorism  efforts that were sharply criticized both in the United States and in Europe. At the time, political pressure was mounting in Germany to investigate and expose the practice of extraordinary rendition, which involved capturing suspects and sending them to third-party countries for questioning in secret prisons. Mr. Masri was seized on Dec. 31, 2003, as he entered Macedonia while on vacation; border security guards confused him with an operative of Al Qaeda with a similar name. He says he was turned over to the C.I.A., which flew him to Afghanistan, where he says he was tortured, sodomized and injected with drugs. After five months, he was dropped on a roadside in Albania. No charges were brought against him. The case drew widespread attention in Europe. The cables show that the United States was especially concerned about cooperation between Spanish and German prosecutors. The Spanish courts became involved because they concluded that the plane that transported Mr. Masri had traveled through Spanish territory.
world/europe,“This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage this case at a discreet government-to-government level,” read a cable sent from the embassy in Madrid in January 2007. The cables’ release has created a stir in Germany mostly because the documents  contain American diplomats’ caustic comments about German officials and because they show that the embassy had informants in one of the governing parties. The Masri case, however, has already been so thoroughly discussed in public, and the degree of Washington’s pressure on Berlin is so well known, that it has not gained much attention. The one cable that has caught the attention of some in the German press was written on Feb. 6, 2007, by Mr. Koenig, the second-highest-ranking diplomat in the embassy, under the title “CHANCELLERY AWARE OF USG CONCERNS.” Rolf Nikel, Germany’s deputy national security adviser, told Mr. Koenig that the two governments had differences over Washington’s antiterrorism methods, including German opposition to the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and to rendition. Mr. Nikel said, according to the cable, “the Chancellery is well aware of the bilateral political implications of the case, but added that this case ‘will not be easy,’ because of the intense pressure from the parliament and the German media.” Mr. Koenig said that while Washington “recognized the independence of the German judiciary,” he added that “to issue international arrest warrants or extradition requests would require the concurrence of the German Federal Government.” His point was that the case could be stopped.
world/europe,The prosecutor’s office in Munich issued warrants for the arrest of the C.I.A. operatives, but Germany’s government did not press for arrests or extraditions. “We already dealt with this, including in the Bundestag, about why the German federal government did not take further action to carry out the arrest warrant,” said Mr. Ströbele. “How one deals with the fact that he was taken into custody and tortured — whether more will be revealed on that — what was done in order to keep it a secret: that is what interests me.”
theater,Broadway’s Comic Chameleon Writes a Heartfelt New Tune - The New York Times Judging only from his manly industrial-pop score for “The Full Monty,” whose opening number is called “Scrap” and sounds like it, I first imagined David Yazbek as a roadhouse rocker wielding a working-class ax. Four years later, in 2004, fans of his next musical, the Riviera con-artist caper “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,” might have pictured a suave Broadway type, tossing off French pastiche, a comic rap showstopper and a satire of “Oklahoma!” in one boffo score. “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” in 2010, jumbled the image further. His witty songs, with their strong Latin flavor and Almodóvarian edge, evoked the narcissistic torments of a quartet of melodramatic Madrileñas. So by the time it was announced that he would write the score for a stage adaptation of a quiet 2007 Israeli film called “The Band’s Visit,” Mr. Yazbek was an anomaly: a Broadway mainstay, already in his 50s, without a clear profile. As with Frank Loesser many years earlier, what you thought of him depended largely on which of his shows you knew. The director David Cromer knew Mr. Yazbek’s work largely from “Women on the Verge” and its “incredibly heartbreaking, ‘Man That Got Away’ songs.” He therefore expected Mr. Yazbek to be “this really sensitive, heartbroken little gay man.” Instead, when the two met to discuss working together on “The Band’s Visit,” Mr. Cromer thought he’d discovered a “songwriter straight out of the 1930s”: “grumpy and cigar-chomping,” often in a porkpie hat.
theater,That, too, was wrong. Mr. Yazbek doesn’t smoke. It’s a musical chameleon’s curse, and maybe his protection, that people don’t have any idea, sonically or otherwise, who he really is. Those familiar with Mr. Yazbek as Broadway’s go-to songwriter for comedy film adaptations probably haven’t heard his solo work as frontman for a series of rock bands with names like Coke Machine, Moon Pudding, Barn and His Warmest Regards. And vice versa: Those who groove to his sulfurous, often cheerfully pessimistic albums, with songs like “Monkey Baby Hanging on a Chicken Wire” and “Ultrasad,” would probably be surprised by brassy show tunes like “Here I Am” and unironic ballads like “Breeze Off the River.” Which is why it’s understandable that the talk around Broadway about Mr. Yazbek and “The Band’s Visit,” which opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 9 in a production directed by Mr. Cromer, is so wrong. This delicate, contemplative and thoroughly gorgeous musical, first seen last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not represent, as some say, Mr. Yazbek’s unlikeliest disguise to date. Quite the opposite. “The Band’s Visit” is the truest version of him Broadway has yet heard, or is ever likely to. “All my life I’ve written songs, right?” he half-asks, half-demands, lying like an analysand on a couch in the studio he built a few yards from his house in Rockland County. Unlike most people in analysis, though, he noodles gently on a bass as he speaks.
theater,“I’ve made five albums that have nothing to do with musical theater,” he continues. “And, like most singer-songwriters, my motive for writing them was to tell people what I was thinking and feeling. That usually has to do with human connection and death, in a good way: How life is ennobled by the fact of death, and is deeper than what we run around frittering about all day.” He pauses and plinks. “But unlike my other shows, in which I had a real but superficial connection to the characters’ issues, almost every song in ‘The Band’s Visit’ gives me the feeling that I’ve expressed something I feel deeply about.” If that’s a tall order for a musical, “The Band’s Visit” is unusually ambitious, its many comic moments woven like countermelodies into a story of “human beings crying from the heart in joy or pain,” as Mr. Yazbek puts it. With a book by Itamar Moses, based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, it concerns a ragtag Egyptian police orchestra that gets stranded in the wrong Israeli town en route to a gig at an Arab cultural center. Instead of exciting Petah Tikvah, with a ‘P,’ they wind up in a stultifying Negev outpost called Bet Hatkivah, with a ‘B’ — “like in basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah,” as one of Mr. Yazbek’s dead-on lyrics puts it. The theme is miscommunication, including the romantic kind: the terrible gap between what we feel and what we say. In “The Band’s Visit,” the only cure is music, and yet it isn’t enough.
theater,The Egyptians and the Israelis reach out to one another on waves of melody, from ethereal Arab song to thumping klezmer. Two in particular — the band’s leader, Tewfiq (Tony Shalhoub), and Dina, who houses him (Katrina Lenk) — nearly find a common language. But even they eventually have to acknowledge the emptiness, if perhaps a slightly less empty emptiness, that seeps back when melody passes. This theme and setting made “The Band’s Visit” a natural playground for Mr. Yazbek, who grew up on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father and a half Jewish, half Italian mother. For a song about the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, he could call on his own memory of her voice on the radio in a cab while visiting his grandfather in Lebanon. To shape the score’s swirling contours, he did not have to study Middle Eastern scales or Egyptian instrumentation; he was already handy on darbouka (a goblet-shaped drum) and oud (a short-necked lyre). He was also in a good position to translate what he calls “the sound of Israeli sarcasm.” But he had a surfeit of other sounds as well. Growing up surrounded by every kind of music — “Kiss Me, Kate” and Miles Davis on the stereo, the polyrhythms of congas in Central Park — he developed an early and eclectic ear. He started his first band, whose name cannot be published here, when he was 12; played gigs for a thousand students at college block parties; landed a solo recording contract at 28.
theater,Another lifetime later, at 57, though married (to Elizabeth Doberneck, a meditation teacher) and with a son, Omar, in college, Mr. Yazbek retains the slightly hassled aura of a man who has almost made peace with his work — or, maybe more accurately, a man who remakes that peace every day. (He, too, meditates.) This is a vast improvement over the person who seemed to be jumping out of his skin when I first encountered him in the “Full Monty” era. Back then, he seemed embarrassed that, of all the roads open to him, he’d found his biggest success on the one that led to Broadway, with its corny philosophies and unprovoked belting. Among the roads less taken was comedy. Directly out of Brown, he wrote for David Letterman, part of a “Late Show” team that won an Emmy Award in 1984. (His favorite bit was called “The Most Dangerous Game,” in which a pack of bloodhounds searched 30 Rock for the announcer Bill Wendell.) And his career as a solo musical artist never took off the way he had planned — though that was, he says, his own fault. “I made my own bed when I decided not to tour all the time,” he explains. “There were guys like Ben Folds and Dave Matthews who started off at the same time, doing what I should have done: get in a van with a baby grand, go up and down the East Coast circuit and make a subsistence living while developing a fan base. But if I doomed myself by staying home, it turns out it was a great doom. Now all those guys are sick of touring and want to write musicals.”
theater,Even so, for a long time the regret was easily read on his face. The “man-dudes” in his poker game, hoping to annoy him into making mistakes, insisted on calling him “Broadway’s David Yazbek.” That taunt would have been incomprehensible during the so-called Golden Age of musicals. Loesser, Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim, three of Mr. Yazbek’s idols, could aspire to nothing higher than Broadway success — though Mr. Sondheim, coming at the end of the line, eventually grew so disheartened that he threatened to give up musicals for murder mysteries or video games. It’s worth noting that what toppled theater music from its position as the prime engine of popular culture was the same trend that Mr. Yazbek was hoping to ride: the rise of the rock singer-songwriter. Mr. Yazbek has played both sides of the fence, bringing to each discipline the skills and, well, the discipline of the other. Thanks to rock, he writes musical theater lyrics that arise from their stories at unexpected angles and with a looser diction than most of the classics. The rhymes in “The Band’s Visit” are accurate enough to get laughs (awful/falafel; marrow/Pharaoh) but not obsessively mitered. Thanks to musical theater, his rock songs are tighter and better structured than almost anyone’s.
theater,And after decades in which critics openly prayed for a savior to resuscitate theater music with the primal energies of pop, perhaps we can now see that Mr. Yazbek has been doing it, insufficiently heralded, for years. (He received Tony Award nominations for all three of his previous Broadway scores, but has never won.) In the shadow of “The Producers,” “The Full Monty” was a marginal hit; “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” recouped only on the road. “Women on the Verge,” through no fault of Mr. Yazbek’s, was a major flop (though a revised version met with more success in London). Even “The Band’s Visit,” despite its Off Broadway raves, is nobody’s idea of a sure thing. Mr. Yazbek would, of course, love a hit, but his pleasure in the work itself acts as a kind of professional prophylaxis. He has nearly completed the score for a musical version of the 1982 hit film “Tootsie” — as flat-out a musical comedy as you could imagine — and is working on the lyrics to Henry Krieger’s music for a show about the evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker. The luxury of writing only what he wants, while recording the occasional solo album, is enough, he says, to “service my pretensions.” Servicing his spiritual aspirations is a different matter. This used to require performing in public: “The connection you make while sharing in the creation of music with other people in real time,” he says, “is the closest metaphor for the actual connection that every sentient being has, way beneath the surface, at the root of truth.”
theater,Now, he says, he can achieve that connection without so much performing. Still, after certain performances, when company members gather outside the Barrymore or beneath its stage for a jam session of Arabic music, Mr. Yazbek sometimes joins in. On a recent evening, after a two-show day, he grabbed a spare drum from the darbouka player Ossama Farouk, while George Abud, who plays Camal in the musical, improvised on his oud, with Ms. Lenk on violin. They fed one another melodies like canapés. A few rugs and lanterns could not disguise the grimness of what was actually the musicians’ locker room, with costume racks pressing in. But as the four worked through “El Hayah Helwa” (“Life Is Beautiful”) by Farid al-Atrash, and an Umm Kulthum song called “Awedt Ainy,” which Mr. Abud translated as “I’m Addicted to You,” all the discomforts disappeared. And so, after a while, with a huge smile, did Mr. Yazbek. He got what he wanted, and was gone.
us,Streets Closed to Cars for Pope Francis’ Visit Transform Philadelphia - The New York Times PHILADELPHIA —  The group from Iglesia Católico de San Jose in Asheboro, N.C., began its trip to Philadelphia at about 8 p.m. on Friday. Riding in a convoy of vans and a bus, the worshipers — about 180 people in all, most of them Mexican immigrants — drove through the night. By dawn on Saturday, wearing matching custom-made blue T-shirts, they had secured some crucial spots along the police barricades lining Benjamin Franklin Parkway where they hoped to catch a glimpse of Pope Francis. Beyond that, their plans were unclear, including where they were going to sleep. Hotels throughout Philadelphia were at capacity, but they did not seemed worried. If it came to it, they said, they had tents for camping. “We’re just waiting to see what God has planned for us,” Carolina Valdes, 16, said enthusiastically. Optimism and good cheer appeared to be in abundance in Philadelphia on Saturday as hundreds of thousands of visitors poured into the city to be in the presence of Francis, if not see him. Some had come earlier in the week to participate in the World Meeting of Families. Many had arrived on the weekend to coincide with the pope’s visit, traveling from across the country and from abroad, turning downtown Philadelphia into something of a global religious street festival.
us,One group drove from Texas — 26 hours straight. Another — about 50 Filipinos — drove overnight from Toronto. About 1,600 members of a Christian group from the Dominican Republic flew from Santo Domingo, and even in a sea of hundreds of thousands, they stood out: They wore Day-Glo green caps and T-shirts. The visitors arrived in a city transformed. A security cordon was put in place around a 4.5-square-mile section of Center City, prohibiting all but official vehicular traffic. Within that zone, officials established a special perimeter around the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and nearby blocks — a secure zone within a secure zone. The measures effectively turned the urban core of one of America’s biggest cities into a peaceful, pedestrian-only village. Along streets that would typically rumble with loud midday traffic, walkers’ footfalls, hushed conversations and the whir of bicycle freewheels could be heard. “It’s great!” said Matthew Hammond, 36, a bar manager from Philadelphia who had been enjoying the experience of car-free streets, both on foot and on bicycle. The reconfiguration of the city has not been without its hassles. An elaborate network of security fences has turned downtown into a maze, forcing residents to relearn its geography. At one of the checkpoints leading into the secure zone around the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a lone protester carried a billboard that read, “The Pope is an Antichrist,” and delivered an antipope tirade into a megaphone. But a group of girls waiting at the checkpoint had a response to this protest, chanting just as loudly: “We love Francis! We love Francis!”
us,At one of the few places where pedestrians were allowed to cross Market Street, a major east-west street, on an intermittent basis, the wait for an opening stretched to 20 minutes. But uncomplaining patience prevailed. Some even found an enjoyable way to pass the time. A group of young missionaries, members of the Legionaries of Christ from Cheshire, Conn., spotted some of their brethren waiting to cross from the opposite side of Market Street. The two groups began a call-and-response. “I love Jesus!” sang one side. “I love Jesus!” echoed the other. “I love the pope!” the first group called out. “I love the pope!” came the reply.
us,Ferguson Became Symbol, but Bias Knows No Border - The New York Times If the shooting of Michael Brown had taken place about 500 yards to the southeast, he would have died not in Ferguson, Mo., but in the neighboring city of Jennings. The court system there, which is overseen by a white judge but has almost exclusively black defendants, routinely sends people to jail for failure to pay minor traffic fines, a new lawsuit alleges. Had the shooting occurred three and a half miles to the north, the world’s attention might have turned to the city of Florissant, where in 2013, the police stopped black motorists at a rate nearly three times their share of the population. Less than four miles to the northwest, in Calverton Park, court fines and fees accounted for over 40 percent of the city’s general operating revenue last year. But it was Ferguson and its government that came under federal scrutiny almost unprecedented for a city of its size, culminating in a Justice Department report last week that described explicit racism among city officials, abusive policing and a system that seemed to view people “less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.” And it is Ferguson that will almost certainly be forced to make wholesale changes.
us,Ferguson, a city of 21,000, is unusual in some respects — it has issued the most warrants of any city in the state relative to its size, for example — but the unfairness in its court system that the Justice Department highlighted is not limited to it, to St. Louis County or even to Missouri. In one meeting of federal investigators, a Missouri F.B.I. agent told colleagues that if he had been asked to predict which cities were most likely to erupt over racially charged policing, Ferguson would have been low on his list. Yet Ferguson’s neighbors are not under the same pressure to change. “Ferguson is one dot in the state, and there are many municipalities in the region engaged in the same practices a mile away,” said Vanita Gupta, the Justice Department’s top civil rights prosecutor. “It would be a mistake for any of those neighboring jurisdictions to fold up their hands. They should absolutely take note of this report.” Ms. Gupta urged police and city officials nationwide to read the report on Ferguson and take stock of whether their police and court systems were equally in need of an overhaul. “The Ferguson report really does highlight some issues that jurisdictions around the country are plagued with,” she said. “Police departments shouldn’t wait for us.”
us,Across the country, a mounting number of investigations and lawsuits have focused attention on the justice system’s heavy burdens on the poor. In Alabama, which has tried to make up for deep cuts to court funding by imposing fees like $35 for posting bail, half a dozen lawsuits contend that local courts perpetuate a cycle of steep fines for minor offenses and jail for those who cannot pay. And as early as 2009, Florida became a model for aggressive collection of court fees and fines. “There’s clear case law that police can’t illegally search you for no reason, but it happens 10,000 times a day,” said Alec Karakatsanis, a co-founder of Equal Justice Under Law and the lead lawyer in suits against Ferguson and Jennings. “The Constitution is not self-executing.” While statistics alone are not clear-cut proof of discrimination, there are cities around St. Louis with far greater racial disparities in traffic stops than Ferguson, and cities with court systems that appear even more predatory than the Justice Department says Ferguson’s is. According to a report from Better Together, a nonprofit group, Ferguson does not even rank among the top 20 municipalities in St. Louis County in the percentage of its budget drawn from court fines and fees. The small city of Edmundson, five miles away, brings in nearly $600 a year in court fines for every resident, more than six times the amount in Ferguson.
us,Antonio Morgan, the owner of a car repair business, has spent months in various St. Louis County jails, paid thousands of dollars and been shocked by a Taser, mostly because of traffic violations. “People are actually getting mad that everybody thinks it’s Ferguson, Ferguson, Ferguson,” Mr. Morgan, 29, said. “They pull over a lot of black people, yeah, but they’re not the worst, I’ll tell you that. It’s worse ones than that.” Not only do nearby cities work in the same ways as Ferguson, but they work with the same people. Ronald J. Brockmeyer, the municipal court judge in Ferguson whom the Justice Department report singled out for ticket-fixing, is a judge in another city and a prosecutor in three more. Ms. Gupta said civil rights prosecutors were seeking information to help small cities and towns that may have problems but are unlikely to attract attention in Washington. But she also made clear that it was incumbent on local governments to make changes themselves, because “the Justice Department can’t be everywhere.” Officials in nearby cities rejected any comparison to Ferguson. “You don’t dismantle the whole house in order to kill one bug,” said Mayor Patrick Green of Normandy, who is black. He said that his police force had issued more citations since state agencies asked it to help patrol Interstate 70, and that the money had been used to pay for public safety. “Everyone’s saying, ‘Oh, no, that’s cities just taking advantage of the poor,’ ” he said. “When did the poor get the right to commit crimes?”
us,James A. Paunovich, chairman of the board of trustees of Calverton Park, echoed Mr. Green’s sentiment, saying, “You’re blaming the police officer or you’re blaming the municipality or blaming the judge for enforcing the law.” He added, in a common refrain, that cities the size of his, with few or no businesses, do not have many ways to raise money. “They have to find a recession-proof revenue generator,” said Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz, a political-science professor at the University of Rhode Island, adding that the best solution for small, financially struggling cities like Ferguson was probably to declare bankruptcy. “No matter how poor people are and how strapped people are, you can hit them with a fine.” On Friday, Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, acknowledged that “the Ferguson municipal court is not alone” and expressed support for a variety of changes, such as the cap on the percentage of revenue a city can collect from traffic tickets and court fees, and alternatives to jail for people who cannot afford to pay fines. Benjamin Sutphin, the mayor of Jennings, declined to comment because of the lawsuit against his city. Officials in Florissant did not return calls for comment. The St. Louis County Municipal Court Improvement Committee, formed after the Brown shooting, has recommended voluntary changes such as increasing the use of community service as a sentence for indigent offenders and setting a uniform fine schedule across jurisdictions. (It found that the fine for driving without insurance, for example, ranged from $99 in Bridgeton to $377 in Ferguson.)
us,Frank J. Vatterott, the municipal judge of Overland and the chairman of the committee, who is white, said a majority of courts had responded positively to the recommendations. But he added: “I don’t have any power. We have no legal or moral authority over the other courts.” Enforcement would also be a problem for the kind of revenue caps being pushed by Mr. Nixon and some state legislators. The state already limits fines and fees to 30 percent of municipalities’ yearly operating revenue, and Missouri’s attorney general, Chris Koster, has sued five cities in St. Louis County for exceeding that. Mayor Green, whose city is a defendant in the lawsuit, said the cap would hit predominantly black cities hardest. Brendan Roediger, a professor at Saint Louis University School of Law, said the only solution was to discard the county’s municipal court system and replace it with something else. “I don’t think that it could possibly be fixed,” said Mr. Roediger, who, along with Arch City Defenders, a nonprofit legal group, is suing several municipalities over their court practices. “The system is absolutely rotten from the core.” He pointed to the routine ticket-fixing by officials across city lines described in the Justice Department report. This collusion, along with the everyday transfers of people from city jail to city jail, shows just how much the municipal governments are tied together, he said.
us,Qiana Williams, 36 and the mother of a 9-year-old girl, said she had been jailed multiple times for traffic violations. She was once arrested when she called the police for help after a former boyfriend hurt her. None of this took place in Ferguson, she said: Some of her worst experiences were in another county altogether. “They’re all suffering from the same problems,” said Ms. Williams, who is black, adding that she had already been working with a group of activists to plan a protest against the municipal court in Pine Lawn when the shooting of Mr. Brown in August drew the protests northwest to Ferguson. “St. Louis knows that it’s not just a Ferguson problem,” she said. “I don’t know if the country knows.”
world/asia,Leaders of South Korea and Japan Meet in Effort to Mend Ties - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea — President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan held the first high-level meeting between their two nations in more than three years on Monday and agreed to accelerate talks on repairing ties strained by bitterness rooted in Japan’s colonial rule of Korea. The leaders started their meeting at Ms. Park’s presidential office here, the Blue House, with Ms. Park calling on Japan to “heal the painful history” and Mr. Abe urging South Korea to “look to the future.” After one-and-a-half hours, they produced no breakthrough, simply agreeing to support talks already underway between their governments to narrow differences, especially over the issue of so-called comfort women — tens of thousands of Korean and other Asian women sent to work at front-line brothels for Japan’s World War II military. But their summit meeting reflected a growing awareness on both sides that the neighbors, both staunch allies of the United States, should not let their historical grievances trump mutual economic and security interests, including a joint effort in stopping North Korea’s nuclear weapons development. On a trip that highlighted the challenges faced by Washington and its regional allies, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter of the United States met his South Korean counterpart, Han Min-koo, in Seoul on Monday to discuss combined defenses against what they called North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats.
world/asia,“Keeping in mind the fact that this year marked the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan and provided an opportunity for a turning point, the two heads of state agreed to add impetus to the talks on comfort women,” Kim Kyou-hyun, Ms. Park’s presidential secretary for foreign affairs, said after the meeting. Mr. Abe told Japanese reporters that he agreed to try to find an “early solution” to the subject of comfort women, one of the most emotional issues stemming from Japan’s often brutal colonization of Korea from 1910 to 1945. He said he did not want to “leave an obstacle for the future generations in building” relations with South Korea. Even before the two leaders began talks, the gulf between their interpretations of their shared history remained so wide that analysts said the only significant achievement of their meeting might be the meeting itself. Yet in some ways, the meeting was a chance for both Ms. Park and Mr. Abe to save face. For years, Washington, on which both Japan and South Korea depend for national defense, has been pressing its two Northeast Asian allies to resolve their differences, given the anxiety rippling across the region over China’s growing assertiveness and North Korea’s nuclear arms program. By refusing to meet Mr. Abe while holding several summit meetings with President Xi Jinping of China over the past few years, Ms. Park set off speculation in Washington that she was drawing Seoul too close to Beijing, a concern her government has been trying to ease.
world/asia,Mr. Abe, whose nationalistic views on Japan’s imperial past have incited rancor among South Korean and Chinese leaders, attended a trilateral meeting with leaders of both South Korea and China, which took place on Sunday. It would have been especially awkward for the visitor not to have a bilateral meeting with the host, Ms. Park. Ms. Park met one-on-one with the visiting Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, on Saturday, throwing a dinner for him. In a sign of unresolved animosities between Japan and South Korea, Ms. Park’s office decided not to host a luncheon for Mr. Abe after their late morning meeting on Monday. Until now, Ms. Park has refused to meet Mr. Abe, insisting that Japan take steps toward what Seoul regards as proper atonement for its colonial-era activities. South Korea says that Japan not only has failed to take responsibility for forcing or luring the comfort women into sexual slavery, but that under Mr. Abe, it has systematically attempted to whitewash its wartime atrocities. Japan says that the matter was resolved once and for all in the 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties between the two nations. South Korea and Japan held their last summit talks in 2012, when President Lee Myung-bak and Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda met and bickered over the issue of the comfort women. Bilateral ties chilled further after Mr. Lee became the first South Korean leader to visit the South Korean-held islets that Korea calls Dokdo later that year. Japan also claims the islets, which it calls Takeshima.
world/asia,Vietnam: 2 Sentenced Over Blog Posts - The New York Times Vietnam jailed a well-known political blogger and his assistant on Wednesday for posts that a Hanoi court said were abuses of their freedom and infringements upon state interests, their lawyer said. The blogger, Nguyen Huu Vinh, was sentenced to five years in prison and his assistant, Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy, received a three-year term. Both had denied any connection with the blog posts. Vietnam has been widely rebuked for its tough moves to curb online dissent as public appetite for the Internet soars and Web users turn to blogs to read about issues that state-controlled media avoids. The United States Embassy in Hanoi urged the government to release the two prisoners, “as well as all other prisoners of conscience.”
dining,Ciano: Chef Shea Gallante Returns to Kitchen - The New York Times SHEA GALLANTE was only 19 years old when he opened his first restaurant. It was a pizzeria in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where he grew up. Soon he decamped for the nearby Culinary Institute of America and then Manhattan, where he trained in some of the city’s top kitchens (Felidia, Bouley). At 31, he was tapped to be the chef of Cru. At 33, he landed a Michelin star. Then, last June, he left Cru. He was 36. He had no exit strategy: no new restaurant lined up, no cookbook, no television deal. For a while he went back to work for his former mentor, David Bouley. By January he had retreated to his home in Westchester to regroup. Although he had won accolades for his sophisticated, inventive cooking at Cru, the food was, if not subordinate, beholden to the restaurant’s raison d’être, its monumental wine list. And he now admits that having to appeal to a crowd with eclectic tastes was not satisfying for him. “I got a little confused,” he said. He wanted to find focus. So he took a sabbatical. Westchester is not quite the equivalent of holing up in an ashram, but it gave him time with his family and a chance to figure out the next step. Enter Stratis Morfogen, the man behind the Philippe empire, an ever-replicating chain of fancy Chinese restaurants better known for celebrity sightings than cuisine. He was looking to open an unpretentious Italian place.
dining,The idea was “a great chef doing humble dishes,” he said. He wasn’t sure Mr. Gallante was right for the job (“Cru was stuffy”), but two hours into their first meeting he started to change his mind. It seems an improbable partnership. “People have asked about our differences,” Mr. Gallante said. “I come from fine dining, he has a very high-energy social background. How’s that going to work?” That’s a dichotomy Mr. Morfogen would like to break down. “What’s happening in the restaurant scene is, when the food is great there’s no energy, and when the energy is great the food isn’t any good,” he said. “Why can’t a three-star chef do meatballs?” In October they plan to open Ciano in the former Beppe space at 45 East 22nd Street. Mr. Gallante describes it as a “stripped-down Italian restaurant — no polish, no Christofle silver.” In a populist move, many of the wines will be available by the half bottle. On the menu will be steamed black bass in a light tomato broth, gnocchetti tossed in black truffle butter —  and, yes, meatballs. It all sounds rather straightforward from a chef known for more rarefied cuisine. “We’re not going to be pairing squid with grapefruit spuma,” Mr. Gallante said firmly. Nevertheless, his new  kitchen will have the same equipment he had at Cru: Hold-o-Mat, Pacojet, immersion circulator. He won’t elaborate further. “The most important thing is what’s on the plate,” he said.
dining,These days, his preferred tool is a spoon, which he always carries in his hand or in his pocket. His new mantra, after a year of soul-searching? “Less is more.”
business/international,Japan Announces More Stimulus Measures as Economy Struggles - The New York Times
sports/olympics,U.S. Basketball Team Muffles Argentines, if Not Their Fervent Fans - The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO — Argentine fans were irrepressible, bouncing up and down and back and forth across the stands, waving flags, imploring their compatriots to jump along, and singing that anyone who did not join the fun was Brazilian. The Brazilians yelled right back, heralding the career goal tally of Pelé, their soccer hero, and crowing about their five World Cup trophies. They made sure, of course, to insult Diego Maradona, Argentina’s own World Cup legend. It was, in many ways, a typical sardonic showdown between fans of the two soccer-mad South American rivals — except it was happening on Wednesday night at a basketball game between Argentina and the United States. After the Americans had scuffled through the final three games of the pool stage, Coach Mike Krzyzewski suggested that the presence in the quarterfinal round of the Argentine fans — who had been making so much noise the last two weeks — might invigorate his players. Whether it helped or not, the Americans looked lively amid the noise, sauntering to a 105-78 win that left the Brazilian fans — their sports allies for a night — singing in joy. As the seconds ticked off the clock in the blowout, Brazilian fans yelled out “Olé!” to usher the Argentines out of Carioca Arena 1.
sports/olympics,“We didn’t understand what was going on,” said Paul George, who had 17 points and 8 rebounds and galvanized his team with his defensive effort. “We didn’t know if they were against each other or if they were cheering with each other.” The Americans will face Spain — which steamrollered France, 92-67 — on Friday in the semifinals. “We enjoyed it,” George said. “That’s new to us. We enjoyed being in this atmosphere.” The Americans, many of them still relatively new to international basketball, had found the vibe at their earlier games a bit odd. The stands at the Olympic arena sit far back from the sidelines. Nonpartisan crowds at certain games did not seem compelled to make much noise. “It’s almost like a golf tournament,” DeMarcus Cousins said this week, gently tapping the fingers on his right hand against the palm of his left. “It’s different.” The Americans are used to the atmosphere of the N.B.A., with the familiar tableau of the league’s arenas. Sound technicians make sure to quash any threat of silence with thunderous music. Courtside seats creep up along the sidelines, eliminating personal space between players and fans. “You can’t hear as much trash talking as usual,” DeAndre Jordan said about the fans in Rio. On Wednesday, Argentine fans arrived early to spread their jollity inside and around the arena. They belted out the country’s national anthem in full voice. They were eager to scream, and it helped that their team got off to a fast start, jumping out to a 10-point lead in the first quarter.
sports/olympics,Whenever the United States fans started a chant — “U-S-A!” or “De-fense!” — they were drowned in a torrent of whistles and jeers from the Argentine fans. The local Brazilians, who consider Argentina their big sports rival, did some jeering of their own on the Americans’ behalf. “I’m a huge fan of soccer,” Jordan said. “The fans are engaged in the game. They have chants and cheers and the wave going. It’s cool.” The decibel level dropped for a spell, though, as the Americans charged back, producing a 38-8 scoring run at one point. Halfway through the second quarter, Kyrie Irving displayed his exceptional ball-handling skills, stringing together a dizzying sequence of crossovers on Nicolas Laprovittola to create an opening to the rim. Amid the momentary quiet, the Americans made their own fun. In the second quarter, when Kevin Durant (27 points) disassembled Andres Nocioni with a crossover — before scoring on a head-fake, Euro-step, fadeaway combination — the reserves on the American bench popped off their seats and pirouetted with delight. Despite the loss, Argentine fans’ spirits were high. Asked at halftime about the atmosphere, Gerardo Genzano, a fan from Argentina, said, “Argentina has taken over Rio.” Asked who would win, he changed the subject. “We need more beer,” he said. Durant, who averaged 16.8 points in the first five games, was unstoppable. He shot 9 for 13 from the field, including 7 for 9 from 3-point range, and added seven rebounds and six assists before sitting for most of the fourth quarter. Durant described the knockout game as a Game 7 and praised his teammates for raising their intensity level. He complimented the outward national pride of the Argentine fans.
sports/olympics,He said he had heard chants of “U-S-A!” rising above the din. “It gave me chills,” he said.
style,The Secret to Marriage Is Never Getting Married - The New York Times I am often asked if I am married. Sometimes I lie and say that I am. Sometimes I lie and say that I am not. Neither answer feels entirely truthful to me. If I say I am not married, the true answer, people occasionally try to set me up with their offspring. They seem to think I would be a great daughter-in-law. Actually, I would be a great daughter-in-law. I send thank-you cards. I am a terrific conversationalist. I can bake a pie. I met the man I am not married to the second week of college. “You’re wearing black,” Hans said. “I’m wearing black.” This was said with some irony; we were standing in a black box theater. Everyone was wearing black. He had a girlfriend, so we didn’t get together until several months later. We have been together ever since, 21 years. A year before I met Hans, a relative of his opened a credit card in his name and charged the better portion of another relative’s wedding. And then she forgot to pay the bill. For years. Forever, actually. Hans didn’t find out until two years after the crime, when he was applying to graduate school. Even after making arrangements to pay off the debt, his credit was ruined and he couldn’t get student loans. The credit card company told him the only way to clear his credit would be to take the relative to court. Identity theft is a serious crime, the company said, and she could possibly go to jail.
style,Hans wouldn’t do it because the woman had a child, and he didn’t want the child to grow up without a mother. I liked that about him. He was in his early 20s and less than poor. But what difference did it make? He was a person of integrity, and we were in love. We had been together six months. It can be awkward to describe this situation to people I don’t know. They tend to ask follow-up questions: “Why didn’t you just clear the credit cards and then get married?” “Why didn’t I?” I say lightly. The answer is: many reasons. Because I was 18 when I met him and didn’t know how long the relationship would last. Because it was a lot of money and I was embarrassed to ask my parents for help. Because neither of us had regular jobs and we both wanted to be artists more than we wanted to be married people. Because one of us needed good credit in order to rent apartments and charge groceries. Because by the time we had the means to make honest people of ourselves, we felt as if we had been together too long to bother. But I don’t say any of these things. “Don’t you like weddings?” someone will ask. I love weddings. The odd mix of religion, government and pageantry moves me. It’s like theater, but with real people.
style,I have been to weddings. I have seen the white dresses. I have worn the bridesmaid dress. I have smelled the roses. I have never caught the bouquet, but I have watched its trajectory with enthusiasm. I have heard the wedding band play “Shout,” and I have gotten a little bit louder now. I have shopped the registries, and I have sent the pasta makers, the towels, the knives and the vases. I am comfortable with the fact that as a person who has no plans to marry, I will not receive the pasta maker, the towel, the knives or the vase in return. Hans and I have been together a long time, and for better or for worse, we have those things already. My accountant recently broached the subject of marriage with me. He has been my accountant for the last 13 years, and I feel as if he’s my second most important long-term relationship. We were discussing whether I should consider getting married now. I said, “It feels like it has been too long.” I guess because I am turning 40 this year, he said, “Well, there are reasons to be married when you are old.” The reasons fell largely into two categories: What happens when I die? And what happens if I get sick and then die? Once, on the way back from Japan, a customs agent was furious at Hans and me for sharing a checked suitcase when we weren’t related. We were not family, which meant we needed to speak to customs separately. So how to deal with the problem of a shared suitcase? What was a customs agent to do?
style,“Well, you see,” I remember saying, “when he was in college, a relative opened up this credit card, and. ...” Basically, this encounter encapsulated the reason to get married at this peaceful midpoint of our lives. Because as you get old, per my accountant, life becomes a series of skirmishes with customs agents. I know he is right. At this point, though, the math bothers me. I don’t want to start over again at Year 1. I worry that if Hans and I were to get married now, it would somehow be like saying the last two decades didn’t count. I have had four dogs with the man I am not married to. I have dedicated several of my books to him, but really, they all could be. He is my most important reader and creative collaborator. We have traveled the world with one suitcase. We have cooked more than 100 Blue Apron meals without killing each other. We have shared a dozen different addresses. We have built a life. But we are not married. We live in California, which means we are not even common-law married. Some time ago — we had not been married for 15 years — when we had an apartment by Riverside Park in New York, Hans woke up, looked out the window and said with boyish, almost biblical conviction, “Everything is telling me that’s Kristen Schaal.” She was on one of our favorite shows, “The Flight of the Conchords.” We went down to walk our dog and the woman was still sitting in the park.
style,It was not Kristen Schaal. It could not have been less Kristen Schaal. And now we say this to each other all the time: “Everything is telling me that’s Kristen Schaal.” It is amazing how often this can be worked into conversation. This won’t be funny to anyone but the man I am not married to. Our friends recently got divorced. They had been together as long as we had, and I had thought they were happy. But you can never know what goes on between two people. I asked her, “What percentage of time would you say you were happy?” “Twenty percent,” she said. Several weeks later, she revised her estimate: “Maybe 2 percent.” “Two!” I said. “How can a person live in a state of 2 percent happiness?” “Perhaps 3,” she revised again. Hans and I are happy together most of the time. We have the usual domestic squabbles. Our most frequent argument ends with him throwing up his hands and saying, “I’m not a handyman!” Sometimes I think the secret to a long and happy marriage is never to get married in the first place, although there are surely married couples that are as happy as we are. Not long ago, when a woman asked me the marriage question, I stumbled on what I believed to be the correct answer: “I have been with the same man for more than two decades, but I am not sure either of us believes in marriage.” I felt clever for stating my situation so concisely.
style,“Belief,” she scoffed. “Belief is for little children and Santa Claus.” She was right. It’s just words to say I don’t believe in marriage. Having stayed with a person for more than 20 years, I must believe in marriage. I must believe that life is better in a pair than it is single. When I say I don’t believe in marriage, what I mean to say is: I understand the financial and legal benefits, but I don’t believe the government or a church or a department store registry can change the way I already feel and behave. Or maybe it would. Because when the law doesn’t bind you as a couple, you have to choose each other every day. And maybe the act of choosing changes a relationship for the better. But successfully married people must know this already. I wake up in the morning and I look at Hans and think, I love you. I choose you above any other person. I chose you 21 years ago and I choose you today. I believe you to be a constant in my life, and I, a constant in yours. Loving you is the closest thing I have to faith. Everything is telling me that’s Kristen Schaal.
sports/tennis,From a Low Point, John Isner Finds a Way to New Heights - The New York Times John Isner had time to kill. After a first-round loss to Ryan Harrison in Acapulco, Mexico, in late February, Isner was hanging his head. He had lost his first match in four of the five tour events he had entered in 2018, even falling in the first round at the Australian Open to 78th-ranked Matthew Ebden. “I was losing so early in events, and when that happens your confidence gets shaken,” said Isner, 32, who had won 12 ATP tournaments in his career but had never advanced beyond the quarterfinals at a major. “I didn’t have the feeling of making it deep into a tournament, and when you lose early, you have five, six, seven days to think about it.” He did not need to arrive in Indian Wells, Calif., for his next tournament until the following week, so Isner made a three-day stop in Los Angeles to work with Justin Gimelstob, one of his three coaches. Gimelstob, a former tour player who also works as a television commentator, had accompanied Isner for three years until family issues forced him to curtail his travel. “I have tremendous belief in him, I always have,” Gimelstob said. “People always oversimplify John because they think he’s all serve and he should be able to win that way.”
sports/tennis,Isner and Gimelstob did not make any major changes in those three days. Instead, they focused on adjusting small things like Isner’s footwork on the forehand, the position of his outside leg on the backhand return, and his racket position on the volley. They even tweaked the toss on his serve, even though the 6-foot-10 Isner has hit a staggering 8,800 aces in his 11-year career. By the time Isner arrived at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, he thought he was ready to win. Instead, he fell to Gaël Monfils, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (3), 7-5, in his first match. Isner even held a match point with Monfils serving at 4-5 in the third set. Yet again, he had some time off to wonder what had gone wrong. But Isner was also entered in the doubles event with his fellow American Jack Sock, giving him a reason to stick around and someone to practice with and to hang around with at day’s end. Isner and Sock went on to capture the title, beating Bob and Mike Bryan in the final. “We just kept it loose and I was able to stay in match mode, even though it was doubles,” Isner said. “It helped so much to win the tournament. I was able to get that winning feeling back.” When Isner arrived at the Miami Open two weeks ago, he was feeling physically fortified, but still a little shaken mentally and emotionally. He and David Macpherson, his day-to-day coach, dissected past matches during nightly dinners, and Isner confessed to having some inner demons that were preventing him from closing out contests.
sports/tennis,“People think when you’re struggling and not winning matches it’s because you’re not working hard,” said Isner, who said that he gained a new perspective on his tennis, and his life, when he married his longtime girlfriend, Madison McKinley, last December. “That’s the biggest misnomer in tennis. All of us work hard. I know I do. But I also needed to put in some mental work with my coaches. I had to be a little bit vulnerable in hashing out what I’m feeling in the big moments and what was preventing me from playing my best in those moments. I had to get it out of my system.” The result was a more relaxed and free-flowing Isner, a player who cracked groundstrokes with new aplomb and roared through the Miami Open draw, upsetting second-seeded Marin Cilic, fifth-seeded Juan Martín del Potro and fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev to capture the first Masters 1000 title of his career. Two weeks shy of his 33rd birthday, Isner is the oldest first-time Masters 1000 champion. The victory also catapulted him to a career-high ranking of No. 9 and gave him the largest payday, at $1,454,982. This weekend, Isner will lead the United States in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against Belgium in Nashville. A win would put the team into the semifinals in September against either Croatia or Kazakhstan. The last time the Americans reached the semifinals was in 2012, when they lost to Spain. It has been 11 years since the United States, behind Andy Roddick, James Blake and the Bryan brothers, won its last Davis Cup.
sports/tennis,Though Belgium was runner-up last year, the team is without David Goffin, the No. 10-ranked men’s player in the world, and Steve Darcis, who are injured. In their place are No. 110 Ruben Bemelmans and No. 319 Joris De Loore. The two other team members, Sander Gillé and Joran Vliegen, are not ranked within the world’s top 1,000 singles players. The American squad has five players in the top 55, with Isner, Sock, Harrison, Sam Querrey and Steve Johnson. Jim Courier, the U.S. Davis Cup captain, plans to play Isner and Querrey, his two highest-ranked players, in singles, and then make a doubles decision among any number of combinations at the last minute. Courier was particularly encouraged by what he saw from Isner in Miami. “I was equally impressed by the velocity on his backhand and the quality of his forehand return,” said Courier, who is in his eighth year as the American captain. “In the past, he used to hang his head when things weren’t going right. He just needed to see some positives and the benefits of his hard work.” Courier and Isner think this is a group that can end the American Davis Cup drought. The players are close friends — practicing, playing doubles, even trash-talking through spirited poker games together. Gimelstob said that sense of camaraderie and teamwork, as well as managing expectations, might have helped propel Isner to a new height in singles.
sports/tennis,“John knows that it’s not supposed to be easy and you have to expect adversity,” he said. “Tennis is not like team sports where you can pass the ball. In an individual sport, you have to be the center, the point guard, the forward and the shooting guard, all in one. He’s always been second-guessed throughout his career as to whether he can be more than just a server. Now he knows he can be.”
fashion,Grandma, Grandson ... Colleagues - The New York Times If you have not, over the course of the last six decades, tuned in to various public television stations to watch “The Open Mind,” here’s what you have missed: a 30-minute public-affairs-focused interview program that covers topics ranging from civil rights to pornography to baseball, and features guests running the gamut from blues musicians to judges to Nobel laureates. This year, the show turns 60. It was, for nearly its first 58 years, hosted by Richard Heffner, a historian and professor who died in 2013 at age 88. In its last few years, it has been hosted by Alexander Heffner, 26 and a 2012 graduate of Harvard. But the real star of the show is Elaine Heffner, 89, Richard’s widow and Alexander’s grandmother. She is the program’s new executive producer and longtime muse. “Water, Pellegrino or vodka?” she said in welcoming a guest on a recent evening to her large Upper West Side home. Flitting about the apartment to collect drinks, Dr. Heffner was dressed in tailored pants, a sweater and sensible flats, looking not a day over 80. She and her grandson were soon to depart for a dinner date. But first, there was a quick check-in with “The PBS NewsHour,” which was playing on the television in the living room. She leaned against a cushioned window seat, the sprawl of the Hudson River and New Jersey behind her. Mr. Heffner sat on a chair near the television, not quite reclining, his back never touching the cushion.
fashion,He loved as a young boy watching his grandfather prepare his “Open Mind” scripts, and as a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and then at Harvard, he hosted radio programs that prepared him for his current gig. Mr. Heffner speaks in long, structurally complicated, grammatically perfect sentences. He often calls his grandmother “Elaine.” Dr. Heffner is the mother of two and grandmother of four, a psychotherapist who has been on the faculty of Cornell’s medical school since the 1980s, and a consultant to the elite Diller-Quaile School of Music (which makes her something of a well-known figure to a certain sort of Upper East Side parent). Dr. Heffner graduated from Cornell after World War II, and completed her doctoral studies at Columbia in the 1980s, after her two sons had grown. “I didn’t go to my doctoral graduation because it was the same year my son was graduating from law school and I didn’t want that competition,” she said. In the apartment vestibule, Mr. Heffner helped his grandmother put on her coat as she bade farewell to her poodle, Cassie. They set off for the eight-block walk to La Mirabelle, a classic French restaurant. Mr. Heffner made a few calls on his mobile phone, and his grandmother worried about the way that youngsters jaywalk while distracted by technology. She doesn’t text, but she is no Luddite. She is learning what “streaming television” is all about, and she maintains a blog called “Good Enough Mothering.” Women today, she said, “feel just as conflicted and guilty about working or not working as they did in the 1970s.”
fashion,Her husband was a champion of her career and an editor of her writing. “One of the last things he gave me before he died was a reprint of ‘Commas for Dummies,’” she said. “He would tell me, ‘You just worry about the writing, and I’ll take care of the commas.’” At the restaurant, Dr. Heffner was greeted by name by the maître d’, and she and her grandson sat at a corner window table. They often go to hear jazz after a meal, but tonight it will just be dinner (soft-shell crab for her, duck for him, wine for both) and a catch-up on the guests. Recently, Mr. Heffner has hosted Vincent Fella Hendricks, the director of the Center for Information and Bubble Studies at the University of Copenhagen, and the journalist Ahmed Shihab-Eldin. The idea is to try to book people potentially on the cusp of renown. This was a talent of his grandfather’s: He had before-they-were-famous guests like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957. Mr. Heffner was excited to tell his grandmother about a big-name booking: Joe Weisberg, the creator of the FX program “The Americans.” It will actually be Mr. Weisberg’s second appearance on “The Open Mind.” “He was a guest of my grandfather’s as a little-known spy novelist,” Mr. Heffner said.
fashion,Dr. Heffner brought her own institutional knowledge to the booking. It happens that Mr. Weisberg’s wife, Julia Rothwax, is the daughter of old friends of her and her husband’s. “Remember the Joel Steinberg trial? Harold Rothwax was the judge in that case,” she said, recalling he had a bicycling accident yet refused to stay off the bench. “He was trying the case, and it was a big thing and his hands were in casts.” They are good together this way, grandson and grandmother, millennial and octogenarian, one an old soul, and the other who is young at heart.
world/europe,Despite Anger Over Downed Jetliner, Europe Shies Away From Sanctions on Russia - The New York Times AMSTERDAM — In cafes across the Netherlands, a new Cold War with Russia had already erupted. “We have to draw a line somewhere,” said Meindert van der Kaaij, a silver-haired journalist, lamenting over beers those who died on Flight 17, 193 of them from the Netherlands. “We must say something.” Russia, everybody agreed, was the real culprit. “What can we do?” Niels Romijn, a civil servant, snapped back. “We must be realistic; there is just not much we can do.” It was a mirror image of the debate that unfolded in bland diplomatic language in Brussels, where foreign ministers of the European Union’s 28 member states were under pressure to display resolve and common purpose after the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet over eastern Ukraine. In the end, there was plenty of tough talk, yet no real punishment for Russia despite calls from Australia, Britain and the United States, which have all accused Russia of supplying the missile that brought down Flight 17, to take a tougher line. Despite widespread anger over the plane’s downing, European nations have shied away from measures that would further isolate Russia. Dependent on Russian gas and oil, wary of confrontation on the Continent and alive to the fact of Russia’s proximity, Europe’s leaders have largely decided that they will have to live with a newly assertive Russia.
world/europe,“Almost every European state has voluntarily handed over power to Mr. Putin, allowing him to play countries against each other,” said Marietje Schaake, an influential member of the European Parliament, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. “We should choose for energy independency, for principles, human rights and rule of law. But that is not what we are doing now.” At Tuesday’s meeting, the foreign ministers agreed to draw up a new, broader list of targets for sanctions, including Russian individuals and entities, said Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief. But no new additional measures were imposed, reflecting fears among some Europeans that tougher sanctions would invite reprisals by Russia against countries dependent on its energy supplies, harming the Continent’s economic growth. Nowhere is the European conundrum clearer than in the Netherlands, a tiny nation of 16 million but one of the wealthiest in the European Union. For more than a decade, the Dutch have been forging closer ties with Russia, emphasizing a growing trade and economic partnership while pointedly ignoring Mr. Putin’s regional ambitions. Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, which has its head office in The Hague, is one of the largest foreign investors in Russian gas fields in Siberia. Shell is the largest corporation in the Netherlands, and its stock is widely held in the nation’s pension funds. If Shell loses money, the pensions of Dutch teachers, civil servants and many others suffer. As a result, the ties between Shell and the government are extremely close, and the company’s welfare inevitably influences policy, analysts said.
world/europe,“They have direct access to everybody in the establishment,” said Sweder van Wijnbergen, who was the secretary general of the Ministry of Economic Affairs from 1997 to 2000. A former boss, Hans Wijers, then the minister in charge of the economy, sits on the Shell board of directors. “Naturally, Shell will try to prevent any sanctions against Russia,” Mr. van Wijnbergen said. “Of course, the government ultimately makes its own decisions.” A spokesman for the company declined to say whether Shell would reconsider its investments in Russia after the downing of the plane. Four Shell employees died in the crash of Flight 17. After China, the Netherlands is Russia’s most important trading partner. The Russians and the Dutch have invested billions in each other’s countries. In 2012, the Netherlands imported about $27.3 billion worth of gas, reselling 95 percent of it to the rest of Europe, official statistics show. Russia imported $9.7 billion in office equipment, food and flowers. The port of Rotterdam saw the import of Russian oil rise fivefold over the past decade, making the country the largest importer of Russian gas. Shell has been a major investor in a huge Russian liquefied natural gas project in Siberia. The Dutch entanglement with Russia through Shell is emblematic of ties that many European nations have with Russia. In making the case for tougher sanctions to his Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain argued that Europe should use its economic leverage against Russia.
world/europe,“It is time to make our power, influence and resources felt,” Mr. Cameron said Monday. But other European countries have parried efforts to strengthen penalties on Russia. France has opposed proposed sanctions against arms sales to Russia, in part because it is building two Mistral-class helicopter carriers for Russia’s military. “For the time being, a level of sanctions has not been decided that would prevent this delivery,” President François Hollande of France said Monday. “The Russians have paid,” he said, and canceling the deal would require France to reimburse Russia $1.5 billion. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Monday said that communication lines with Russia needed to stay open. Juurd Eijsvoogel, a foreign affairs columnist for one of the leading Dutch newspapers, NRC Handelsblad, said, “Germany does not follow the U.S. blindly.” In Ukraine, Europe is widely seen as waffling. “It looks like they will not impose any strict sanctions,” said Svitlana Khutka, an associate professor of sociology at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in Kiev. “Why? Because they say they are very concerned, deeply concerned, very, very concerned, very much concerned, so very deeply concerned,” she said in an interview. “You just don’t believe that they are concerned, because it is quite evident that they have their own interests.” The Dutch have declared Wednesday, when the remains of passengers on board Flight 17 are expected to arrive in the Netherlands, a day of mourning. At the same moment, Dutch leaders are carefully trying to balance the open anger — an increasing number of people are calling the episode a war crime — with the country’s deep economic ties with Russia.
world/europe,In full-page advertisements in major Dutch newspapers, the government offered condolences, but described the downing of the plane as a “disaster” rather than a missile strike. In recent days, Prime Minister Mark Rutte has made sure to keep his lines of communication with Mr. Putin open, to “bring the bodies home,” he has said repeatedly. Behind the scenes, Dutch investors in Russia are also consulted, former insiders said. “Of course representatives of Shell are discreetly talking to the government throughout the plane ordeal, in order to minimize damage to the company,” Mr. van Wijnbergen said. Many Dutch people said they hoped for a tougher stance toward Russia from Mr. Rutte. “His real test will come after the bodies have arrived here, and after we have mourned,” said Mr. van der Kaaij. “I think many people in the Netherlands expect him to take a tougher stance. What kind of country are we if we just smooth this over?”
theater,Edie Falco’s New Role, in Her Colleague Liz Flahive’s Play - The New York Times Suppose you wrote a new play. It’s only your second, but it’s got a great part for an actress who can win over the audience to a character who can be unsympathetic, someone who can convey existential malaise at the same time as tough-day-at-work frustration. Now suppose that when you’re not working on your plays, you write for a TV show. This show just happens to star, as the title character, an actress who has turned a mob wife and a Vicodin-addicted nurse into audience darlings and who makes a point of returning to her New York theater roots every chance she gets. This should make for the easiest casting process in the world, right? Just tap her on the shoulder with one hand while holding the script in the other? “Absolutely not,” said Liz Flahive, whose day job is as a producer of the Showtime medical comedy “Nurse Jackie,” which stars one Edie Falco. “That’s not how I would feel comfortable. It just wouldn’t be good manners.” Sitting next to Ms. Flahive in a lounge at City Center, where Manhattan Theater Club is staging the play, Ms. Falco said, “I wish you had.” Through far more circuitous means the two women are spending their “Nurse Jackie” hiatus working on Ms. Flahive’s new piece, “The Madrid,” which is in previews and opens on Feb. 26. “To think that I would have dibs on a new play — that doesn’t happen often,” said Ms. Falco, the only actress to win Emmy Awards for starring in both a comedy (“Nurse Jackie”) and a drama (“The Sopranos”). “I get offered them, but only after other people turn them down.”
theater,Ms. Falco plays Martha, a kindergarten teacher who one impulsive day goes AWOL on her students and her family. This happens in the first scene of “The Madrid,” which follows her friends and loved ones — particularly her 22-year-old daughter, Sarah (Phoebe Strole) — preparing for a short- and long-term life without Martha. (The title refers to the dingy apartment building where Martha sets up shop.) “It feels like a play about a maternal identity crisis, albeit from the daughter’s point of view,” said Ms. Flahive, 33. She began writing the play when she was six months pregnant with her son, now 2. “I haven’t met a mother who hasn’t wanted to disappear for a while,” she said. Her desire to escape from the all-consuming demands of parenthood was strictly predictive at that point. What about Ms. Falco, 49, who herself has two young children? “Well, I can’t speak for every mom, but ...,” she said with a slightly sheepish grin. “I mean, parenthood is not a hobby. Your life is basically sucked from you.” “Nurse Jackie,” which is produced in New York City, has an impressive roster of stage talent on both sides of the klieg lights: Anna Deavere Smith and Bobby Cannavale have appeared with Ms. Falco, and Rajiv Joseph (“Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,” this spring’s “North Pool”) was among Ms. Flahive’s fellow writers. So Richie Jackson, Ms. Falco’s manager and the show’s executive producer, wasn’t surprised to see Ms. Flahive plugging away on a play during her downtime. He brought her on to the “Nurse Jackie” crew after seeing her first play, the 2008 domestic drama “From Up Here.”
theater,“I would jokingly say to her now and then, ‘How’s the play coming along?’ ” Mr. Jackson said. “One day she sent me an e-mail and said, ‘Here it is.’ It was extraordinary, and I sent it on to Edie without telling Liz. I wanted her to be able to be honest without worrying about Liz’s feelings.” He’s not the only one to take some credit for the pairing. Mandy Greenfield, director of artistic operations at Manhattan Theater Club, co-producer of “From Up Here” and commissioner of “The Madrid,” said, “Edie had been very vocal with us about wanting to create a role in a new play.” After she read “The Madrid” Ms. Falco was the first actress she suggested. “When I mentioned her name to Liz, her face lit up.” Whoever linked them up, Ms. Flahive maintains that she didn’t write “The Madrid” with Ms. Falco in mind. Given the unpredictable nature of casting, she said, “That’s a recipe for heartbreak.” Ultimately Ms. Falco, whose “Sopranos” and “Nurse Jackie” hiatuses have been filled with Broadway revivals (“Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,” “The House of Blue Leaves”) and new work (“This Wide Night”), eagerly signed up to do Ms. Flahive’s play. The two have four years of shared experience to draw upon. Along the way they have learned to do a lot with a little, a skill that comes in handy on a play in which the main character becomes more of a presence through her absence. “Liz has an incredible ability to get to an emotion with very few words,” Mr. Jackson said, “which makes her a perfect writer for Edie.”
theater,The more relaxed pace of “Madrid” rehearsals was also a blessing for both women. “You have the luxury of time in a play,” Ms. Falco said, particularly when it comes to revisiting a certain scene or moment. “In TV I feel horrible for the writers. There’s just no time.” What there is plenty of in television is money, which may explain why so many playwrights have dabbled, or more, in that world. Among Ms. Flahive’s close friends are the playwrights Kim Rosenstock (“Tigers Be Still”) and Steven Levenson (this spring’s “Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin” and “Core Values”). They are working on the series “New Girl” (Ms. Rosenstock) and “Vegas” (Mr. Levenson). “The money certainly can be very enticing, and you have to be clear that that’s not what’s driving you,” Ms. Falco said, at which point Ms. Flahive interjected, “But the money can also put you on a plane to a workshop of your play.” New episodes of “Nurse Jackie” will begin April 14, and the fate of the show beyond this season, its fifth, remains uncertain. While Ms. Falco has adopted a Zenlike serenity over her career moves — “My little plans for myself are never as good as what shows up” — at least one aspect of Ms. Flahive’s future is clearer. It appears that writing “The Madrid” has quenched any pangs of maternal wanderlust. “I would like to take a beat and hang out with my boy,” she said.
health,Scientists Move Closer to Understanding Schizophrenia’s Cause - The New York Times Scientists reported on Wednesday that they had taken a significant step toward understanding the cause of schizophrenia, in a landmark study that provides the first rigorously tested insight into the biology behind any common psychiatric disorder. More than two million Americans have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, which is characterized by delusional thinking and hallucinations. The drugs available to treat it blunt some of its symptoms but do not touch the underlying cause. The finding, published in the journal Nature, will not lead to new treatments soon, experts said, nor to widely available testing for individual risk. But the results provide researchers with their first biological handle on an ancient disorder whose cause has confounded modern science for generations. The finding also helps explain some other mysteries, including why the disorder often begins in adolescence or young adulthood. “They did a phenomenal job,” said David B. Goldstein, a professor of genetics at Columbia University who has been critical of previous large-scale projects focused on the genetics of psychiatric disorders. “This paper gives us a foothold, something we can work on, and that’s what we’ve been looking for now, for a long, long time.”
health,The researchers pieced together the steps by which genes can increase a person’s risk of developing schizophrenia. That risk, they found, is tied to a natural process called synaptic pruning, in which the brain sheds weak or redundant connections between neurons as it matures. During adolescence and early adulthood, this activity takes place primarily in the section of the brain where thinking and planning skills are centered, known as the prefrontal cortex. People who carry genes that accelerate or intensify that pruning are at higher risk of developing schizophrenia than those who do not, the new study suggests. Some researchers had suspected that the pruning must somehow go awry in people with schizophrenia, because previous studies showed that their prefrontal areas tended to have a diminished number of neural connections, compared with those of unaffected people. The new paper not only strongly supports that this is the case, but also describes how the pruning probably goes wrong and why, and identifies the genes responsible: People with schizophrenia have a gene variant that apparently facilitates aggressive “tagging” of connections for pruning, in effect accelerating the process. Some scientists warned that the history of biological psychiatry stands as a caution against premature optimism. “This work is extremely persuasive,” said Dr. Samuel Barondes, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, “but any step forward is not only rare and unusual, it’s just one step in a journey of a thousand miles” to improved treatments.
health,The study, by scientists from Harvard Medical School, Boston Children’s Hospital and the Broad Institute, a research center allied with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, provides a showcase of biomedical investigation at its highest level. The research team began by focusing on a location on the human genome, the MHC, which was most strongly associated with schizophrenia in previous genetic studies. On a bar graph — called a Manhattan plot because it looks like a cluster of skyscrapers — the MHC looms highest. “The MHC is the Freedom Tower” of the Manhattan plot, said Eric S. Lander, the director of the Broad Institute. “The question was, what’s in there?” The area is a notoriously dark warren in the genome known to contain genes that facilitate the body’s immune response, for example, by flagging invading bacteria to be destroyed. That property had given rise to speculation that schizophrenia might be a kind of autoimmune condition, in which the body attacked its own cells. But the research team, led by Steven McCarroll, an associate professor of genetics at Harvard, and by Aswin Sekar, one of his graduate students, found something different. Using advanced statistical methods, the team found that the MHC locus contained four common variants of a gene called C4, and that those variants produced two kinds of proteins, C4-A and C4-B. The team analyzed the genomes of more than 64,000 people and found that people with schizophrenia were more likely to have the overactive forms of C4-A than control subjects. “C4-A seemed to be the gene driving risk for schizophrenia,” Dr. McCarroll said, “but we had to be sure.”
health,The researchers turned to Beth Stevens, an assistant professor of neurology at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard, who was an author of a 2007 study showing that the products of MHC genes were involved in synaptic pruning in normal developing brains. But how important was this C4 protein, exactly? Very important, it turned out: Mice bred without the genes that produce C4 showed clear signs that their synaptic pruning had gone awry, Dr. Stevens’s lab found. Taken together, Dr. Stevens said in an interview, “the evidence strongly suggested that too much C4-A leads to inappropriate pruning during this critical phase of development.” In particular, the authors concluded, too much C4-A could mean too much pruning — which would explain not only the thinner prefrontal layers in schizophrenia, but also the reason that the disorder most often shows itself in people’s teenage years or early twenties. “The finding connects all these dots, all these disconnected observations about schizophrenia, and makes them make sense,” Dr. McCarroll said. Carrying a gene variant that facilitates aggressive pruning is hardly enough to cause schizophrenia; far too many other factors are at work. Having such a variant, Dr. McCarroll estimates, would increase a person’s risk by about 25 percent over the 1 percent base rate of schizophrenia — that is, to 1.25 percent. That is not nearly enough to justify testing in the general population, even if further research confirms the new findings and clarifies the roles of other associated genes.
health,Yet the equation changes when it comes to young people who are at very high risk of developing the disorder, because they are showing early signs — a sudden slippage in mental acuity and memory, or even internal “voices” that seem oddly real. This ominous period may last a year or more, and often does not lead to full-blown schizophrenia. The researchers hope that the at-risk genetic profile, once it has been fleshed out more completely, will lead to the discovery of biomarkers that could help clarify a prognosis in these people. Developing a drug to slow or modulate pruning poses another kind of challenge. If the new study shows anything, it is that synaptic pruning is a delicate, exquisitely timed process, and that it is still poorly understood. The team does not yet know, for example, why C4-A leads to a different rate or kind of pruning than C4-B. Any medication that tampered with that system would be a risky proposition, the authors and outside experts agreed. “We’re all very excited and proud of this work,” Dr. Lander said. “But I’m not ready to call it a victory until we have something that can help patients.”
world/americas,Raúl Castro Prepares to Resign as Cuba’s President, Closing a Dynasty - The New York Times HAVANA — Raúl Castro, who took over from his brother Fidel 12 years ago and led Cuba through some of its biggest changes in decades, is expected to step down on Thursday and hand power to someone outside the Castro dynasty for the first time since the Cuban revolution more than half a century ago. During his two terms as president, Mr. Castro, 86, opened up his Communist country to a small but vital private sector and, perhaps most significantly, diplomatic relations with the United States. It was a notable departure from his brother’s agenda, yet it was possible only because he, too, was a Castro. His handpicked successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, 57, is a Communist Party loyalist who was born a year after Fidel Castro claimed power in Cuba. His rise ushers in a new generation of Cubans whose only firsthand experience with the revolution has been its aftermath — the early era of plenty, the periods of economic privation after the demise of the Soviet Union, and the fleeting détente in recent years with the United States, its Cold War foe. Officials started gathering here in Havana on Wednesday morning and put forward Mr. Díaz-Canel as the sole candidate to replace Mr. Castro, all but assuring his selection by the Communist Party.
world/americas,Though Mr. Díaz-Canel’s path to the top office has been forecast for years, many an heir apparent before him has fallen by the wayside in the search for a successor to lead the country, whether because of party disloyalty, snide remarks or projecting too much power for the Castros’ liking. In that delicate balancing act, Mr. Díaz-Canel, a former provincial leader who became the most important of Cuba’s vice presidents, has shown the sort of restraint prized by the Castros. But that same caution has left him an enigma both inside and outside the country. Few American officials — even those in the United States Embassy in Havana — have spent time with him or can claim to have shared more than a few passing words. Even the most seasoned Cuba experts have only faint clues as to what he will do, how he will lead and how much latitude he will have to chart his own course. Cuba’s next president could be hemmed in from multiple sides. For one, Raúl Castro is expected to remain the head of the Communist Party and wield great influence. Even Fidel, who ruled Cuba since the revolution, did not officially become president until years later, allowing others to occupy the post while he ran the country. Beyond that, the diplomatic opening with the United States has closed abruptly under President Trump, limiting Mr. Díaz-Canel’s ability to maneuver economically.
world/americas,“There is nothing in his résumé to suggest he is going to take risks,” Theodore Piccone, a Cuba scholar at the Brookings Institution, said of Mr. Díaz-Canel. “But that is the way the system works — anyone willing to take the risk before now would not be in line to be the president.” [Cuba’s New President, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez: Loyal Servant of a Revolution He Didn’t Fight] Mr. Castro is leaving office at a time of tremendous change on the island, both real and promised. In just the last decade, Cuba has lost its defining leader, Fidel, which made way for Raúl to take unprecedented steps to loosen the state’s grip on the economy and begin to nurture a private sector. Then, two years ago, the nation brokered a détente with the United States, paving the way for the reopening of the American Embassy and the first visit of a sitting United States president in 88 years. But change is often a managed affair in Cuba, orchestrated to maintain order while leaving little to chance or, especially, political uncertainty. While historic, the economic changes in Cuba have been halting, to the frustration of many Cubans hoping for better pay and more opportunity. So, too, has foreign investment, with leaders leery that it could grow to the point that they can no longer control it. Now, the country’s next president will face a new set of challenges. Since coming to office, Mr. Trump has lashed out at Cuba and reversed, in spirit if not entirely in deed, the new relationship that President Barack Obama established with the Cuban government.
world/americas,As Cuba seeks to modernize its moribund economy with a new generation of leaders less tethered to the past, the United States appears to be moving back toward a policy of isolation. Fewer American tourists are visiting Cuba and bringing dollars with them, in no small part because of Mr. Trump’s decision to undo some of Mr. Obama’s easing of restrictions on travel to the island. And then there are the mysterious ailments that affected a group of American diplomats stationed in Havana. American officials say they were attacked by unidentified devices that damaged their hearing. In response, the United States issued a travel warning to its citizens and reduced the size of its embassy staff by two-thirds. For now, there is no office in Cuba that can issue visas for Cubans seeking to visit family members in the United States. How the sudden slide in relations with the United States will affect Mr. Díaz-Canel’s ability to sustain the economy and stave off domestic pressure remains unclear. Mr. Díaz-Canel, though a prominent advocate of bringing internet service to the island and considered a relatively modern thinker within the context of Cuba, is not expected to deviate from the party line or the prescribed, deliberate path toward economic reform outlined by his predecessor. In all likelihood, he will govern with less flexibility than Mr. Castro, who enjoyed a special status on the island because of his family name and revolutionary credentials. And Mr. Castro is not vanishing from the scene. As president of the Communist Party, he will preside over an important bastion of power.
world/americas,“Díaz-Canel is one of those people who has risen through the ranks because he represents the prevailing view within the party, not because he himself has taken any particular initiative,” said Benjamin Rhodes, who was a top aide to Mr. Obama and one of the main brokers of renewed relations with Cuba. “I think he is going to be significantly more constrained than either Fidel or Raúl.” Still, as the public face of this long-awaited transition, Mr. Díaz-Canel has been thrust between the crosscurrents of change and tradition. It will certainly not be an easy task: preserving the achievements of the revolution — socialized medicine and education, among them — amid economic turbulence that threatens the nation’s future. Mr. Díaz-Canel’s leadership will be defined in some respects by how he manages the competing forces within the country and his own government. Today, the streets of Cuba brim with young people anxious for a new dynamic, one in which the future is valued more than the past and individual prosperity is not considered a threat to historic ideals. But the ranks of government remain filled by an older, powerful generation of leaders clinging to the past, a group venerated for its connection to the revolution. Their resistance made reform difficult for even Raúl Castro to push through. Without the same legacy to rely on, Mr. Díaz-Canel will be forced into a minefield of tasks that even his predecessor failed to complete. Chief among them are economic reforms central to the nation’s survival.
world/americas,He will have to foster the growing private sector, the future engine of the economy and the fulcrum on which employment will hinge, while guarding against the income inequality it often brings. After years of visible growth, with restaurants and bars popping up across Havana and elsewhere, the government decided last year to stop issuing licenses for private businesses, fearful that the pace was getting out of control. Some establishments were practically minting money, with hourslong waits for meals that cost as much as a night out in New York. In a nation where government salaries hover around $30 a month, this raised concerns not only about inequality, but also the potential for a class of businesspeople with the resources to be politically powerful. Foreign investment to update Cuba’s crumbling infrastructure is another priority. Business zones launched with much fanfare by the government carry few prospects. The government’s conditions for foreign investment remain unattractive, experts say. Even the very basics — food and energy — need attention. Cuba imports the majority of its agricultural products, as well as its oil. Inefficiencies and failing infrastructure have left a poor farming legacy that keeps food off the tables of many regular Cubans. The slow collapse of Venezuela, a longtime benefactor of Cuba, has expedited the crisis and robbed the country of much-needed resources. Venezuela has already cut its oil shipments to Cuba drastically, worsening the island’s finances.
world/americas,Perhaps most immediately, Mr. Díaz-Canel will have to unify two separate currencies in widespread use on the island, a gambit that will produce big winners and losers in a country that prides itself on equality. “It’s a high-wire act,” said Julia Sweig, a Cuba expert at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. “The expectation dynamic among the Cubans is that they still want a functioning state that delivers services. And yet they also want the state to get out of the way.” To say that Cuba has remained in stasis would be unfair. Beginning with a slate of economic reforms pushed forward by Raúl Castro, all the way through to the decision to restore diplomatic relations with the United States, the nation has been opening. Many have criticized the pace at which economic reforms are rolled out, but the delay is due in part to the magnitude of the experiment the nation is conducting: an effort to define its own brand of socialism in a modern world. The Cubans have sought counsel from the Chinese and, most recently, the Vietnamese, whose leadership was in Havana last month for high-level talks. But the Cuban government is also deeply worried about liberalizing too quickly and converting its fragile gains into a sideshow for tourists plowing into the next big Caribbean destination. Move too slowly and it risks economic collapse and widespread discontent, especially from a young population that has known only hard times. Move too fast, and it risks unstitching the unique tapestry of Cuba’s social project.
world/americas,To drive home this point, Raúl Castro for years has shown young officials a documentary about the oligarch class in Russia after the demise of the Soviet Union. In Cuba, the screenings offer a cautionary tale of how a nation and its values can unravel if economic transition is not managed carefully. “Raúl Castro is a conservative if the regime’s future and the future of the achievements of the revolution are in danger,” said Hal Klepak, a military analyst and biographer of Raúl Castro. “He’s a reformist in every other occasion.” That is the sort of continuity that many are expecting from Mr. Díaz-Canel — especially with Raúl Castro still in the picture as party president. “I think he is very smart, very cautious, as I think he better be for a while, until he delivers some goods,” Mr. Klepak added about Mr. Díaz-Canel. “I view him as a reformist with Raúlista credentials: He’s reformist while reform reinforces the achievements of the revolution.” “The moment that reformism threatens the achievements of the revolution, he flips,” he added.

sports/tennis,Roger Federer Withdraws From French Open Because of Injury - The New York Times PARIS — Roger Federer withdrew from this year’s French Open on Thursday, putting an end to one of tennis’s most remarkable streaks. The last time Federer, 34, did not take part in the main draw in singles at a Grand Slam event was in the last millennium. That was in August 1999, when he lost in the second round of the qualifying tournament at the United States Open to a fellow Swiss, Ivo Heuberger. Since then, Federer has played in a record 65 straight Grand Slam singles tournaments, winning a record 17 titles and firmly establishing himself as the most successful men’s player of the Open era. “I have been making steady progress with my overall fitness, but I am still not 100 percent and feel I might be taking an unnecessary risk by playing in this event before I am really ready,” Federer, who is ranked third, said in a statement Thursday. “The decision was not easy to make, but I took it to ensure I could play the remainder of the season and help to extend the rest of my career. I remain as motivated and excited as ever.” Federer did not cite a specific injury in his withdrawal statement. His remarkable longevity has been grounded in sound technique, serious preparation, intelligent scheduling and an attacking mind-set and skill set that have allowed him to keep rallies shorter than most of his rivals have been able to.
sports/tennis,But his health has become a major concern during a deflating season in which he has played in only four tournaments and won 11 of 15 matches. “This is sad, but it’s also smart,” Paul Annacone, Federer’s former coach, said of the decision to withdraw. “It’s going to be a really busy next few months.” Annacone added: “He’s wrestled Father Time to a stalemate so far, and I hope he can keep Father Time in check a little while longer. But we all know who’s undefeated.” Federer had surgery on his left knee on Feb. 3 — the first operation of his career — after tearing the meniscus while running a bath for his twin daughters shortly after losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open. His back problems — long-running but long manageable — also have flared up, forcing him to withdraw from the Madrid tournament this month. Last week, he lost to Dominic Thiem in the third round in the Italian Open in Rome and appeared to be hampered in his movement. “I saw a lot of it in 2013,” Annacone said. “When Roger’s back is not right, I can see when he’s going out for wide balls and trying to protect it a little bit. It’s hard to play like that, just really hard, and I think more times than not you end up hurting yourself more.”
sports/tennis,After the loss to Thiem, Federer said he was not certain he would play at Roland Garros. As it turned out, he was only able to practice, traveling to Paris and training briefly on the red clay at the stadium on Wednesday. Guy Forget, the new French Open tournament director, said Ivan Ljubicic, Federer’s coach, had made a preliminary request for Federer not to play his first-round match until Tuesday, which is the last day reserved for first-round singles play at Roland Garros. “I told him, of course, we’d try to do the most we could, depending where he ended up in the draw,” Forget said. “When a player asks for this kind of thing, it shows that each day counts.” Darren Cahill, the ESPN analyst who is coaching Simona Halep, said the cool and clammy weather in Paris this week had probably not helped Federer’s chances. “Been coming here many years, never felt it so cold on court like it was today,” Cahill said Thursday. “The weather makes it tough for anyone with a back issue, or any issue, for that matter. Roger’s made a career of making smart, educated decisions, so I’m sure he’s doing the right thing. “Watching him in Rome, he was always going to be iffy here, considering it now means five-set battles. He knows his body. He knows the risk and potential setbacks to the grass-court season if there’s a hiccup in Paris. It seems like the right move if he’s not near 100 percent.”
sports/tennis,Federer, a three-time singles finalist at the French Open before winning the title in 2009, would have been seeded third this year. His withdrawal, announced on the eve of Friday’s draw, means the nine-time champion Rafael Nadal will move up to the No. 4 seeding. That eliminates the possibility of a quarterfinal rematch between Nadal and No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who played in that round in 2015, with Djokovic winning in straight sets. While his rivals focus on clay, Federer will shift his attention to grass and the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where he plans to chase his first gold medal in singles. “Given his chances at Wimbledon are far greater than Roland Garros, this would seem to be a wise choice,” said Jim Courier, the United States Davis Cup captain and two-time French Open champion. “It’s a busy summer, with the Olympics added to the mix this year, so there is a lot of meaningful tennis ahead for him.” In preparation for Wimbledon, which he has won seven times, Federer has entered the grass-court event in Stuttgart, Germany, for the first time and is also expected to play, as usual, at the tournament in Halle, Germany. But respecting that schedule depends on Federer’s ability to recover. “My plan is to achieve the highest level of fitness before returning to the ATP World Tour for the upcoming grass-court season,” he said in his statement.
sports/tennis,When Federer last missed a Grand Slam singles tournament, Pete Sampras was No. 1 and social media was a term that referred to chatty reporters. On Thursday, he announced his decision on Facebook, and it was not long at all before there was a suitable hashtag: #WhenFedererLastMissedASlam. It has been nearly 17 years. Federer’s record, like many tennis records, is difficult to compare across eras. The greats of the pre-Open era rarely stayed amateurs for long and were thus ineligible to play in the Grand Slam tournaments for long. The greats of the early Open era often skipped the Australian Open. But Federer’s mark still merits an exclamation point in a period during which the game has become faster and more physical. “People go, ‘Great, 65 in a row,’ but if you really want to know how good that is, think about how much tennis Roger has played in those 65,” Annacone said. “How many times has he been in the quarters, semis and finals?” Federer is three ahead of Ai Sugiyama, the women’s leader, who played in 62 straight major singles tournaments from 1994 to 2009. Federer is nine ahead of the closest men: Wayne Ferreira and Feliciano López, who are tied at 56. Ferreira, the former South African star, is long retired, but López, a flashy Spanish left-hander, is ranked No. 23 and entered in the French Open. If he plays, he will break his tie with Ferreira, but he would need to play singles in every major tournament through Wimbledon in 2018 to break Federer’s record.
sports/tennis,That is far from a sure thing. López, like Federer, is 34. The threat to Federer’s mark is more likely to come from younger players, including the 30-year-old Tomas Berdych, who is about to play in his 51st straight major, or Djokovic, who will turn 29 on Sunday and is about to play in his 46th in a row.
us/politics,Obama Presses Perry to Rally Support for Border Funds - The New York Times DALLAS — President Obama on Wednesday directly challenged Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to rally Republicans in support of a $3.7 billion emergency measure aimed at solving the humanitarian crisis caused as thousands of Central American children have crossed the Mexican border. The president described a frank exchange with Mr. Perry, who has been one of his most vocal critics, after their private meeting aboard the presidential helicopter and then at Dallas Love Field. The meeting was hastily negotiated as the border crisis came to shadow Mr. Obama’s previously planned trip to Texas and Colorado to raise campaign money and talk about an improving economy. The president said the emergency aid would address Republicans’ calls for increased border security while also providing care for the thousands of unaccompanied children who have been detained in the Rio Grande Valley. Mr. Obama suggested that election-year political maneuvering was blocking the package because Republicans see the crisis as a way to damage him and his party. “The problem here is not major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful,” Mr. Obama said he told Mr. Perry. “The challenge is, is Congress prepared to act to put the resources in place to get this done?” “Another way of putting it — and I said this directly to the governor — is, are folks more interested in politics, or are they more interested in solving the problem?” Mr. Obama said.
us/politics,Mr. Perry, in a statement after his meeting with the president, reiterated that the crisis was the result of “bad public policy,” though he did not specify — as he has in the past — that Mr. Obama’s policies were to blame. He also again asked Mr. Obama to visit the border, about 500 miles south of Dallas, a call that Mr. Obama rejected on Wednesday. “This isn’t theater; this is a problem,” he said. “I’m not interested in photo-ops. I’m interested in solving a problem.” Mr. Obama promised to “do the right thing by these children.” But he also urged parents in Central America to stop sending their children into the United States, a trip he called especially dangerous. “It is unlikely that their children will be able to stay,” Mr. Obama said. More than 52,000 children have flooded into the United States in the last eight months. Mr. Obama’s arrival in Texas, the state with the longest border with Mexico, focused attention on the emerging spike in migration from Central America as well as the political stalemate between the president and his Republican adversaries on a broader immigration overhaul. The president and Mr. Perry met before a round-table discussion on the border issue with local officials and religious leaders. The governor, who had initially refused to stand for an Air Force One photo opportunity with the president, ultimately did greet Mr. Obama on the tarmac at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The pair shook hands amiably if not warmly, and they chatted as they walked to the Marine One helicopter for a brief ride to the Love Field site of the round-table discussion, with Mr. Obama at one point putting his hand on the governor’s back.
us/politics,Mr. Obama said his Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, would soon make his sixth trip to the border to coordinate the federal response with that of the Perry administration. Jim Cole, the deputy attorney general, was in the border town of McAllen, Tex., on Wednesday to tour the Customs and Border Protection facility there and to discuss shifting resources to the region. Mr. Perry’s handling of the crisis is being closely watched by Republicans, given that his 2012 bid for the party’s presidential nomination failed partly because of a sense among the party’s hard-liners that he was too soft on immigration, supporting policies like tuition benefits for Latinos brought into Texas as children. Signaling a tougher stance, he has called on Mr. Obama to deploy 1,000 more National Guard troops to the border and use additional surveillance drones to stop the flow of illegal immigrants. Mr. Obama indicated that he had not ruled out such measures, but that they ultimately were not the answer. “We’re happy to consider how we could deploy National Guard down there, but that’s a temporary solution,” he said. The long-term answer, Mr. Obama said, would be to pass a year-old bipartisan Senate bill overhauling the immigration system and providing more border security and a path to citizenship for millions who have lived and worked in the country illegally for years. In Washington, congressional Republicans expressed both frustration and skepticism about Mr. Obama’s aid request, and members of Mr. Obama’s administration told Congress that they were straining under what one called the “difficult and distressing” surge of unaccompanied minors across the border.
us/politics,Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, W. Craig Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that “the children continue to come across the border” despite the government’s best efforts. Congressional Republicans are left with a dilemma. Their goals are to increase the federal presence on the border and address what they agree is a humanitarian crisis, but they do not want to accomplish them by giving Mr. Obama $3.7 billion that would help get him out of a situation that they believe is of his own making. “What I do think this shows is another area where lack of leadership from this administration is coming back to haunt us,” said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida. At the root of the crisis is a 2008 law intended to curb human trafficking abuses. It requires officials to provide extra legal protections for migrants coming from countries that do not share a border with the United States. The unintended consequence has been to allow children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to overwhelm the immigration system. Some Republicans have said that before they would vote in favor of Mr. Obama’s request, they would need to see the 2008 law amended or repealed to expedite the children’s return to their home countries. Some also said they wanted the relief spending to be matched by cuts in other areas.
us/politics,Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, said he was working with the state’s senior senator, John Cornyn, to introduce legislation in the near future that would amend the 2008 law to treat illegal immigrants from such countries by the same rules that currently apply to Mexico and Canada. The change, he said, would speed up deportations. On the Democratic side, Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, and Dianne Feinstein of California, have expressed deep reservations about sending the children back to potentially dangerous situations. “I think we’d better think twice,” Mr. Durbin said. Ms. Feinstein likened the situation to the “boatloads of Jewish immigrants trying to come to this country during Nazi Germany and getting turned back.” “That’s not what this country is all about,” she said. “This, in my view, has to be handled in a way which is compassionate.” The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Immigration Council also stepped in on Wednesday, filing a class-action lawsuit in Seattle on behalf of the children. The suit argues that the federal government is failing to provide them with adequate legal representation during the deportation process.

us/politics,Trump Drops False ‘Birther’ Theory, but Floats a New One: Clinton Started It - The New York Times Donald J. Trump publicly retreated from his “birther” campaign on Friday, tersely acknowledging that President Obama was born in the United States — and effectively conceding that the conspiracy theory he had promoted for years was baseless. Mr. Trump made no apology for and took no questions about what had amounted to a five-year-long smear of the nation’s first black president. Instead, he claimed, falsely, that questions about Mr. Obama’s citizenship were initially stirred by the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, in her unsuccessful primary contest against Mr. Obama in 2008. Still, Mr. Trump’s brief remarks, tacked on to the end of a campaign appearance with military veterans at his new hotel in downtown Washington, represented a sharp reversal from a position he had publicly maintained, over howls of outrage from all but the far-right extreme of the political spectrum, since 2011. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,” Mr. Trump said. “Now, we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump sought to stoke interest in his eventual statement on his birther views, telling Fox Business that he would save his views for the media-heavy event at his hotel because “we have to keep the suspense going.” Mr. Trump’s embrace of and refusal to disavow the birther issue helped drive his standing among black voters to historically low levels, with some public opinion polls showing him supported by zero percent of African-Americans.
us/politics,Given his other racially incendiary statements, Mr. Trump’s aides privately say they fear he will be unable to shake free of charges that he is racist, a label that has stuck to him with deleterious effect, polls show. Mindful that the birther issue could also haunt Mr. Trump in his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, on Sept. 26, his aides tried for several days to put it to rest. But Mr. Trump himself revived the issue late Thursday, declining in an interview with The Washington Post to acknowledge that Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii. In his brief remarks, Mr. Trump leveled the accusation — which his supporters have been pressing for weeks — that Mrs. Clinton first raised doubts eight years ago about Mr. Obama’s birthplace. “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,” Mr. Trump said. “I finished it.” During the 2008 Democratic contest, a senior strategist for Mrs. Clinton at one point pondered, in an internal memo that was later leaked, the ways in which Mr. Obama’s personal background differed from those of many Americans. But contrary to Mr. Trump’s assertion, neither Mrs. Clinton nor her campaign ever publicly questioned Mr. Obama’s citizenship or birthplace. The topic was such a fringe issue within the Republican Party that in 2011, conservatives, including Ann Coulter, now a vocal Trump supporter, called on Mr. Trump to stop pursuing it.
us/politics,Mr. Trump’s aides, in a statement late Thursday, tried to argue that he had actually “ended” the birther issue. Mr. Trump’s spokesman, Jason Miller, asserted — also falsely — that Mr. Trump had “obtained” Mr. Obama’s birth certificate; the president actually released the long-form version in 2011. “Mr. Trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Trump’s remarks on Friday came after Mr. Obama, in a brief exchange with reporters at the White House, again expressed scorn for the subject. “I was pretty confident about where I was born,” he said. “I think most people were as well. My hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.” Two of Mr. Trump’s top advisers — his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York — said in recent days that Mr. Trump had come to believe that Mr. Obama was born in the United States. But Mr. Trump refused to say so. “I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Mr. Trump said in the Washington Post interview. “I just don’t want to answer it yet.” The Clinton campaign made clear that it would not let Mr. Trump slide on the subject. In a speech to the  Black Women’s Agenda symposium in Washington on Friday — before Mr. Trump made his statement — Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump owed Mr. Obama and the country an apology.
us/politics,“For five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,” Mrs. Clinton said. “His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.” She added, “There is no erasing it in history.” Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Mr. Trump was making such pronounced racial attacks that critics had struggled to adjust. “One of things that we are all used to in this business is dog whistles,” Mr. Clyburn said. “But the thing that we are not used to, and I’m finding it very difficult to get used to, are the howls of wolves. These are howls. These are not whistles.” Mr. Trump must improve his standing with suburban moderates who shrink from backing someone accused of racism. But his remarks on Friday seemed unlikely to make much of a dent. Connie Keys, 54, a stay-at-home mother in Montclair, N.J., said Mr. Trump still seemed not to accept Mr. Obama as presidential. “He makes it sounds like, ‘I should be thanked, I should be applauded, because I’m the one who finally told the country that the president was born here,’ when in fact the voters decided that for themselves when we elected President Obama twice,” said Ms. Keys, who is white. The birther issue brought Mr. Trump attention and vaulted him to the front of Republican primary polls in 2011 as he considered a White House bid. He claimed, without ever offering evidence, that he had hired investigators, and said they “cannot believe what they’re finding.”
us/politics,Mr. Obama, frustrated by the degree to which questions about his citizenship were spreading and attention was being diverted from federal budget discussions, released his long-form birth certificate that April. “We do not have time for this kind of silliness,” he said. Mr. Trump, who was en route to New Hampshire for a political trip at the time, took a victory lap. “I am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,” he told reporters. But he still refused to accept that Mr. Obama’s birth certificate was authentic. “We have to look at it to see if it’s real,” he said. On Friday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said he was glad that Mr. Trump “now rejects the crazy idea President Obama wasn’t born in America.” But he warned that this would not end the discussion. “The problem he’ll have is that he was a leader of this movement,” Mr. Graham said. “I don’t think he did the country a service, himself a service or the party a service by pushing this so hard and so long.” Democrats seized on Mr. Trump’s remarks as a litmus test for Republican candidates. “He continues to disqualify himself, and yet Republican Senate candidates continue to stand by his side,” said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She said Republican candidates needed to say “if they think Donald Trump should apologize to the American people for the absurd lies he has spread about President Obama and why they continue to support a campaign that provides a safe harbor for this type of disgusting race baiting.”
us/politics,Mr. Trump took no questions after his remarks about Mr. Obama. As reporters shouted questions, he smiled and left the room. Not long after, the structure holding up the curtain that had provided a backdrop for his remarks collapsed, sending American flags toppling to the ground. No one was hurt.
sports/baseball,Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig Moves to Match Swagger With Heads-Up Play - The New York Times GLENDALE, ARIZ. — Before their game here on Sunday, the Los Angeles Dodgers practiced cutoffs and relays from the outfield. In past spring trainings, this was less a demonstration of fundamentals and more the Yasiel Puig Show. But times are changing. “He would want to show everybody this off-the-charts throwing arm that no one had ever seen before, and he’d airmail the cutoff man and it’d go all the way to the catcher,” A. J. Ellis, the Dodgers’ catcher, said of Puig. “It would look amazing, but in a baseball setting, that’s not a good play. “And today, he’s catching the ball and he’s still throwing with that amazing arm, but now he’s accurate and he’s diligent and he understands where he needs to throw the baseball. It’s still impressive, but it works in the baseball setting.” That is precisely what the Dodgers want from Puig, their 24-year-old right-field sensation. They want him to take all his sizzle and flash and apply it in the right places. Puig, who defected from Cuba in 2012, seems to agree. He reported to spring training early, with the pitchers and catchers, a signal that he was serious about getting to work after a bitter end to last season. “That’s what I’m doing now, just being more disciplined, getting here on time, getting work done and working hard,” Puig said through an interpreter. “That’s what I’ve been doing to try to get better.”
sports/baseball,The Dodgers won the National League West last season but were eliminated in a division series by St. Louis. Puig, who had eight strikeouts in 12 at-bats, was benched for the finale and appeared only as a pinch-runner. In the off-season, the Dodgers revamped their front office and made several roster renovations. In their flurry of moves, they traded Matt Kemp to the Padres and let Hanley Ramirez leave for Boston in free agency. The Dodgers had sound reasons for moving on from both players, who were often injured and are now in their 30s. But Kemp and Ramirez hit for power, which would seem to underscore the need to get more out of Puig. “We feel like we have a lot of depth, really good balance and guys that have competitive at-bats,” said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers’ new president for baseball operations. “So, on the surface, there’s a chance that we lost power, but we still feel like we’re going to be really good on the run-scoring side, just maybe in a slightly different way. Puig will be a big part of that in the middle of our lineup, but there’s not any more pressure on him to do something he hasn’t.” Last year, Puig hit .296 with 16 homers, 69 runs batted in and a .382 on-base percentage. He started the All-Star Game and dominated for stretches, hitting .398 in May and .351 in July.
sports/baseball,But the overall production was less, perhaps, than it could have been, and the season was marred by off-field mistakes. He was benched for the home opener when he showed up late, and benched again in September when he skipped early batting practice. Manager Don Mattingly said then, “You can’t force guys into work.” Despite that — and his two reckless-driving arrests in 2013 — Puig has been immensely popular with fans. His No. 66 jersey ranked fifth in sales among all major league players in the second half of last season, trailing only Derek Jeter, Clayton Kershaw, Mike Trout and Buster Posey. “I think they like the way I work, the way I play, whether it be the good things I do or the bad things I do,” Puig said, referring to the fans. “And maybe they see the potential of me being a superstar the likes of Miguel Cabrera.” The other top-selling stars — and Cabrera, for that matter — are far more accomplished but with less outward emotion than Puig, who loves to flip his bat and once slid into the plate after a game-ending homer. His swagger is a big part of his appeal. “There are a lot of people that are stars in the game, and their personality is very normal, just very quiet guys who go about their business,” Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy said. “I’m not an advocate of forcing them out of their shells, but I’m a big believer in letting everybody be who they are. People fall in love with those players, because they’re the players who don’t seem to fit what everybody else looks like.”
sports/baseball,At that moment, as if on cue, Puig entered the clubhouse, announcing his presence in a booming voice in Spanish. “There you go,” McCarthy said, smiling. As for the substance to go with the style, Puig is working on it. Ellis said his batting practice, like those cutoff drills, seems more serious now, not just an audition for the home run derby. “It’s not just talent, talent, talent,” Ellis said. “It’s talent, along with trying to execute as a baseball player would execute. And that combination is dangerous, whenever that fully forms. It’s Mike Trout, that’s what it is.” Trout is considered the best player in baseball. Puig may have that in him, and the Dodgers are encouraged as he tries to bring it out.
us,REMEDY FOR WAITING; Harried Doctors Try to Ease Big Delays and Rushed Visits - The New York Times The patients at the Anchorage Native Primary Care Center, a medical clinic in Alaska, did not like to wait. And yet waiting, it seemed, was almost all they did. It took a month or longer to see a doctor. And when patients arrived at the clinic, they usually waited an hour or more to get into an examining room. While their health care at the clinic cost them nothing -- they are Native Americans, using a facility that was partly financed by the federal government -- the delays were so onerous that those who could afford to get their health care elsewhere did so. That was last year. Now the clinic  is unrecognizable. Those who call by 4 p.m. are guaranteed appointments  that day to see their own doctor, even if it is for a routine checkup. And once they arrive, they see their doctor within 15 minutes. ''Most of them still don't believe it,'' said Dr. Christopher Sargent, a family-practice doctor at the clinic. The transformation of the Anchorage clinic is part of a new movement in the practice of medicine that is trying to improve the age-old and often disheartening experience of a visit to the doctor's office. It is aimed at placating patients who are fed up with long waits for appointments, jammed waiting rooms and rushed visits. And it is led by some of the very doctors whose patients were so angered. The doctors, annoyed themselves, decided that there had to be a better way.
us,Their ideas included a new method of scheduling that was put in place at the Anchorage clinic, as well as innovations such as group office visits for up to two dozen people who wanted extra time with the doctor, scheduled telephone calls from a doctor in lieu of office visits for patients with chronic diseases that require vigilance and giving patients access, online, to their medical records. But medical experts have had many good ideas. The real question is, Do they work? After several years of testing some of these ideas, researchers now have evidence that they not only can greatly alleviate irritations felt by doctors and patients, but they can also save substantial amounts of money. Based on the early results, some medical groups across the nation are starting to incorporate the innovations, as are the national health services of England and Sweden. A Boston-based nonprofit organization, the Institute for Health Care Improvement, has formed a national coalition of 23 medical centers that are putting a variety of the ideas on improving care into practice and gathering data on their effectiveness. But even the most enthusiastic proponents readily admit that they face real hurdles. Many doctors have not heard of the new methods and even some who have hesitate to use them because of worries about how to bill insurance companies. And yet, supporters say, the benefits can be overwhelming.
us,''This isn't rocket science,'' said Dr. John Wasson, a Dartmouth doctor who invented one of the new methods. ''With most people, you can make dramatic improvements if they get a little more attention and are told how to manage their own issues.'' Doctor Paved Way The new scheduling system used at the Anchorage clinic had its start when Dr. Mark Murray, a family practice doctor at the Kaiser Permanente medical center in Roseville, Calif., reached the end of his rope. The backlog had gotten so bad that patients  had to wait an average of 55 days for nonemergency appointments. By the time they finally got into a doctor's examining room, they would be so annoyed that the doctors found themselves spending a third of each appointment apologizing or blaming someone else for the long waits and rushed visits. Dr. Murray decided there had to be another way. Turning to industry for inspiration, he reasoned that the crush of patients was like a warehouse full of goods. So how, he asked, did companies keep their warehouses from overflowing? The answer for doctors, he decided, was to clear out the warehouse -- getting oldest  appointments off the books by working longer hours for a while -- and then offering patients appointments with their own doctors the day they called for any problem. He persuaded the administrators at his clinic to try it.
us,Dr. Murray found that demand was entirely predictable. For example, at his clinic, which he said was typical, there was a surge of calls from patients every Monday. There were more calls in the fall and winter than in the summer. And if a doctor took care of 2,500 patients, 21 of them on average  wanted to be seen on any one day and 90 percent of the time the number of patients calling for appointments would be 16 to 25. By doing such analyses of their own patients, doctors can figure out how to balance supply and demand, Dr. Murray said. While they might need to work late on some Mondays in the winter, for example, that would  be no different from what they were doing when they had a backlog and were scheduling two or three patients for the same time slots, hoping some would not show up, and trying to fit in emergency patients anywhere they could. Within a year, after Dr. Murray began  clearing the backlog, the crush of patients at the clinic was gone. ''In this department where in the past we were totally and completely saturated, we were now voting at the end of the day to see who would go home early,'' Dr. Murray said of family-practice section. Even the problem of dealing with hypochondriacs was alleviated, Dr. Murray said. Those patients, he said, always found a way into the doctor's office, seeing any doctor that was available. But under the new system they were confined to their own doctor.
us,''Then you can have an influence,'' Dr. Murray said. ''You discuss the issue with them. You say: 'You come in more than anybody else. This has got to be inconvenient. What is it that I can do to change it?' '' Of course, Dr. Murray and others said, doctors never had to have a backlog in the first place. ''Doctors often forget that they set up their own private hell,'' Dr. Wasson of Dartmouth said. As word spread of Dr. Murray's innovation, other medical centers began asking him for help. About a year and a half ago, Dr. Murray stopped practicing medicine and, with Catherine Tantau, a nurse who had worked with him to develop the idea, began a consulting business on how medical offices can accomplish what he had had Roseville, or what they call ''open access scheduling.'' Many doctors in private practice say they are afraid to try open access, Dr. Murray said, because they think a warehouse of waiting patients assures them of income. ''They think the warehouse is filled with money,'' he said. In fact, Dr. Murray said, the warehouse is filled with ill will as irritated patients start looking elsewhere for medical care. And open access ends up producing at least the same revenue as the old system. Those who have examined the results of open access say that the system worked as well elsewhere as it did in the California clinic.
us,One of the first to try it was the clinic in Anchorage, which provides medical care for more than 20,000 patients. It took months to clear out the patient backlogs, but now, the clinic administrators said, the system is working just as Dr. Murray promised. The only problem came at first, when patients simply could not believe the new guarantee that they could get an appointment with their doctor on the day they called. Many were calling and making an appointment just to see if they could. ''There was this period of, 'I don't believe it, I'm going to try it again,'' said Michelle Tierney, health systems administrator for the Anchorage clinic. For Dr. Douglas Eby, who is vice president of medical services for the Southcentral Foundation, which manages the medical clinic , the real proof of success is in the data. Visits to the clinic for urgent care have dropped by nearly 50 percent, he said. Many more patients are getting preventive care -- the number of mammograms and Pap tests has tripled. And the number of patients who failed to show up for their appointments has fallen to less than 10 percent from 23 percent. Staff members said in a survey that they would never go back to the old system. ''I just knew there had to be a better way,'' Dr. Sargent said. ''I just wish I had thought of it.'' Patients in Groups
us,Dr. John Scott, a geriatrician at a Kaiser Permanente clinic near Denver, had his own problems with the way medical offices were run -- and came up with his own solution. His breaking point came one morning when he realized that every patient he saw had gotten short shrift. ''Every time I closed the door on a patient, I knew there were other things that should be addressed,'' Dr. Scott said, ''but in 20-minute visits, you just don't have the time.'' Wondering why things had gone awry, he decided that doctors were focusing on the wrong group of patients. Everything was set up to help patients with acute problems --  heart attacks, bleeding. But most had chronic diseases and their needs could not be satisfied by doctors who had time for little more than checking their blood pressure and pulse. ''In the regular doctor's office visit,'' Dr. Scott said, ''there is a socialization piece: 'Hi. How are you? How's the family?'Then there's the education, 'Are you taking your medications?' Then there's the hands-on piece where the doctor examines the patient's heart and lungs. Then there's the questions. And usually we answer them with our hand on the door. ''We usually deal with one thing, like your heart. We don't deal with other things like, 'How does your vision impact the fact that you can't draw up your insulin properly?' ''
us,He decided that maybe patients could get the attention they needed if a doctor saw a group of them all at once. To see if the idea would work, he designed a pilot study involving 321 elderly patients with a variety of medical complaints. Each had chronic health problems and was constantly seeking medical attention, averaging more than one office visit a month. Dr. Scott and his colleagues offered half the patients their usual care and the others an opportunity to make any regular appointments they wanted but also to attend a monthly group visit with their doctor. The results were so encouraging in reducing doctor visits while improving patients' health that Dr. Scott expanded it to a study involving 800 patients. Those results which, were even more encouraging, have now been submitted to a leading medical journal for publication. Both studies found that patients who were offered group visits stayed healthier, with significantly fewer visits to the emergency room and to specialists and a slower rate of physical decline. And the patients were happier with their doctors. At first, patients in both groups rated their doctor highly. As time went on, however, those who were seeing their doctor only in the traditional method of office visits liked the doctor less while those who were seeing their doctor in the group visits liked the doctor more. Dr. Scott said: ''We tell the doctor: 'This is what's happening to you. When you're answering questions with your hand on the doorknob, you're giving the message with your body that you couldn't care less about the patient.' ''
us,The program also saved more than $12 a month for each patient offered group visits. Kaiser Permanente's administrators, convinced by the data, encouraged the formation of more groups, and there are now 39 in Kaiser Permanente clinics in the Denver area, with two more scheduled to start by March, said Marlene McKenzie, who coordinates the program. Elsewhere, doctors have been experimenting with group visits for patients who all have one chronic disease, like asthma, diabetes or depression. Others are offering  regularly scheduled group sessions for any of an individual doctor's patients -- even those with serious illnesses like cancer -- who want extra time with the doctor and with a health care professional, like a health psychologist or nurse, who also is present at the meetings. At a recent group visit at a Kaiser Permanente clinic in Wheat Ridge, Colo., 17 elderly people with a variety of ailments began arriving early, eagerly settling into plastic chairs in a windowless room. One couple, Kenneth and Edith Carrier, came even though it was their 54th wedding anniversary. ''It's a heck of a way to spend your wedding anniversary,'' said the 80-year-old Mr. Carrier. But, he added, ''We have a great time.'' For Dr. Scott, the success of the group visits seemed almost too good to be true. ''We went back and looked at the program and said, 'My God, how does this work?' '' he said. One reason, he decided, was that the patients were not afraid to ask questions. In an ordinary office visit, he said, ''Many folks think the doctor is so busy that they don't want to ask anything.''
us,Just as important, the patients help each other, Dr. Scott said. ''I was talking about arthritis one time, and a little voice in the back of the room said: 'You mean I'm going to have to live with this? How am I going to live with this?' Another woman held up a rheumatoid claw and said, 'Honey, at the break I'll tell you how.' '' Regular Phone Chats At Dartmouth Medical School, Dr. Wasson had another idea to improve medical office practice. But his experience showed the obstacles to change, even when an idea's worth can be demonstrated. Dr. Wasson reasoned that one problem for patients was just the sheer trouble of making a doctor's appointment and then, when they arrive, waiting around to get into the examining room and blurting out their questions -- all for something that might not really require that the doctor see them. He developed a study to see whether telephone calls from a doctor might substitute for some office visits. It involved 497 men with chronic diseases.  age 54 and older, at the Veterans Affairs General Medical Clinic in White River Junction, Vt. The researchers assigned half the patients to have their usual office visits. The others had to wait twice as long as usual between office visits but they had received,  instead, three scheduled telephone calls from their doctor in the interim. Each call lasted about 10 minutes. Two years later, the patients who received the calls had 19 percent fewer office visits, used 14 percent less medication, and had fewer admissions to the hospital and shorter stays when they were admitted. Their medical costs were about 28 percent less.
us,Dr. Wasson and his colleagues tried twice to replicate their success. Both times, he said, the doctors were willing to make the calls, but willingness was not enough. One attempt was at a handful of Veterans Affairs' medical centers. The doctors, who were expected to wedge the phone calls into their already busy days, said they simply could not do it. The other attempts were at managed care systems for Medicare patients in Vermont, New Hampshire and Florida. But patients were changing plans and doctors so frequently that the doctors often did not know whom to call. Frustrated, they gave up. For most medical practices, which have a mixture of managed care and fee-for-service patients, there usually is no payment to doctors for phone calls, Dr. Wasson said. And so, he added, ''they don't want to eat up their fee-for-service time with calls.'' The same goes for other ideas, like e-mails between doctors and patients, said Dr. Donald Berwick, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Health Care Improvement, a nonprofit education and research organization in Boston that is encouraging the adoption of the new methods. For now, he added, having a good idea and showing it works might not be enough. A major stumbling block is how to compensate doctors. Some universities use research grants to pay them. At Kaiser, doctors who participate in group visits are compensated by being given extra time when they do not have to see patients. But, for now, the compensation problem can seem overwhelming.
us,''I met with about 100 doctors the other night and I described this stuff to them,'' Dr. Berwick said of the array of ideas for improving care. ''They love it. They all want to go there. But you should have heard the concerns they had. They say: 'I'd lose my shirt. Many of the visits we have are completely useless, but I only get paid for patient visits.' ''It's discouraging,'' Dr. Berwick added. ''I know this is better for patients. I know it is better for physicians. I know the costs will go down. But whether we can get these changes made is anybody's guess. ''I tell the practices to just do it. But there is a very very cautious attitude that says that the status quo always wins.''
business/economy,A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split - The New York Times With the release of an ambitious overhaul of the tax code, House Republicans are moving to fulfill a long-held desire of corporate America: a large and audacious tax cut. Yet economists are divided over whether the plan is likely to revitalize the economy or merely bestow a windfall on the wealthiest investors. Even before President Trump vowed as a candidate to sharpen America’s competitive edge, Republicans led by the House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, were arguing that large tax cuts would unleash a hurricane of economic activity. “With this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,” Mr. Ryan told reporters Thursday on Capitol Hill. “This is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans.” Economists are still parsing the details, but even some ardent supporters of the plan say expectations about heady growth and job gains are exaggerated. Interest rates are already at bargain-basement levels, plenty of potential investment capital is sloshing around, and the official jobless rate is at lows not seen in many years. Moreover, the cost of the tax package will inevitably deepen the deficit and lead to spending cuts that are likely to hit low- and middle-income workers. “It’s hard to see the stimulative benefit on the economy,” said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. “Most of the benefits as best I can tell will go to wealthy people. The idea that you’re going to get a huge spur to growth is delusional.”
business/economy,Such dismissiveness failed to deter fans of the twin pillars of the House bill: lowering the top nominal tax rate on corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent, and changing the way global profits are taxed. “This will make the United States a better place to invest and a better place to be headquartered in,” said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School who has at times complained about the White House’s economic claims. Under the current system, multinational corporations have been shopping around the globe for countries with low tax rates where they can locate their profits and sometimes their operations. Those global profits are taxed by the United States, but only after they are booked at home. The result is that companies warehouse trillions of dollars offshore, indefinitely postponing the payment of United States taxes. Tax rates don’t single-handedly drive investment decisions, and even now deductions and tax credits often shove the rate paid by corporations far below the 35 percent maximum. Still, many economists argue that matching or undercutting the top rate in other advanced industrialized countries — particularly in Western Europe — should encourage investment and productivity. Slashing the rate to 20 percent is “a pretty dramatic change in the attractiveness of the United States relative to other countries,” said Alan Viard, a tax specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
business/economy,Companies were noncommittal on how the plan might actually change their tax practices — like those of Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, which had $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents outside the country on March 31. “Given the complexity of our U.S. taxation system,” a spokesman said Thursday, “the devil will lie in the details of any new legislation.” A shift to taxing domestic and not foreign profits is aimed at discouraging multinationals from moving headquarters, investments and recorded profits abroad. Most other nations have embraced some version of this approach, known as a territorial system. But economists are split on whether that will reduce or worsen global tax avoidance. The bill proposes a global minimum tax of 10 percent to ensure that companies will have to pay something no matter where they have their headquarters. If they pay a lower rate in a foreign country, they would have to remit the difference to the United States. What could bite even harder is a proposal to tack a 20 percent excise tax on transactions between multinationals and their foreign affiliates to deter them from stripping profits out of the United States tax base. No safeguards are foolproof, supporters concede, but they argue that’s the price of admission. “The reality is, base-erosion rules will always be messy and imperfect,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “If you want a territorial system, get over it.”
business/economy,Yet if the House plan resolves some longstanding issues with the corporate tax code, it also creates new ones. Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others. A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business. Indeed a hefty chunk of the administration’s growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause. But the proposal has a five-year time limit. “If expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect,” said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute. For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration. And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment. New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government. “If they want to claim credit for the growth effect,” Mr. Viard said, “then they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.” All would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals. They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.
business/economy,They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair. And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on. That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the educational, transportation, technological and other systems that undergird the nation’s overall economic strength. Critics worry that the focus on corporate competitiveness gives other goals short shrift. “The corporate rate cuts are a windfall immediately for stockholders, and not workers,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And because 35 percent of United States stocks are foreign-owned, he calculated that $70 billion a year of the tax benefits would go to people in other countries. As for working people, he labeled the supposed benefits a “sideshow” because they come so far down the road and are so speculative.  As economists can attest, American competitiveness can be an elusive concept. “Business folks won’t describe it like this, but I think the best way to describe what it means to be more competitive is to describe it in terms of increasing the standard of living of the American people,” said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia Law School. “If it doesn’t do that, then why do we care?”
science,Evidence Is Cited For Life on Mars, But Some Demur - The New York Times Scientists at the Johnson Space Center at Houston say they have found fresh evidence of life on Mars, but other researchers immediately disputed the claim. A crystal found in a meteorite from Mars is similar to crystals formed on Earth by bacteria and may be evidence of the oldest life form ever found, the researchers say in a study appearing on Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ''This is supporting evidence for the presence of ancient life on Mars,'' said Dr. Kathie L. Thomas-Keprta, an astrobiologist at the space center and the lead author of the study. The magnetite crystal was found in a Mars meteorite called Allen Hills 84001, or ALH84001. Researchers at the Johnson Space Center in 1996 announced that the space rock contained microscopic evidence of life, but their assertion has been dismissed by most other researchers. Dr. Thomas-Keprta said the new study strongly supported the original claim and may even suggest that there is still microscopic life on Mars. But some who rejected the 1996 study said they were not convinced by the new evidence. Dr. Ralph P. Harvey, a geologist who has studied the meteorite, said the new conclusions were hasty. ''I don't think this report should be considered as proof'' that life ever existed on Mars, said Dr. Harvey.
science,He said he was troubled that Dr. Thomas-Keprta and her co-authors  found many crystals of magnetite in the meteorite but were reporting only on those crystals that they believed could have come from bacteria.
arts/music,Nicolai Gedda, Celebrated Opera Tenor, Dies at 91 - The New York Times Nicolai Gedda, the Swedish singer who rose from an impoverished childhood and a youthful career as a bank clerk to become one of the most celebrated tenors of the 20th century, died on Jan. 8 in Tolochenaz, Switzerland. He was 91. The Royal Swedish Opera confirmed his death to the news agency Agence France-Presse. Mr. Gedda’s death, after a heart attack at his home in Tolochenaz, had not been announced by his family until this week. Widely admired for his sensitive musicianship, masterly tonal control and impeccable diction in a spate of European languages, Mr. Gedda possessed a lyric tenor voice that shimmered like silver but was no less warm for that. He was one of the most versatile, and professionally long-lived, tenors of his era, with many dozens of roles to his name in a career that lasted until he was well into his 70s — a good two decades past a classical singer’s customary retirement age. Mr. Gedda was ubiquitous on recordings and in the world’s foremost opera houses and concert halls, including La Scala in Milan and Covent Garden in London. Over a quarter-century, he sang 367 performances with the Metropolitan Opera, from his debut in the title role of Gounod’s “Faust” in 1957 to his final performance, as Alfredo in Verdi’s “La Traviata,” in 1983.
arts/music,The fluid lightness of Mr. Gedda’s voice made him especially well suited to the French repertoire: His roles included Des Grieux in Massenet’s “Manon,” Hoffmann in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann,” Roméo in Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette” and the title role in Berlioz’s “Benvenuto Cellini.” Among his Italian roles were Nemorino in Donizetti’s “L’Elisir d’Amore,” Ernesto in his “Don Pasquale” and Edgardo in his “Lucia di Lammermoor,” as well as the Duke of Mantua in “Rigoletto,” Alfredo in “La Traviata” and Riccardo in “Un Ballo in Maschera,” all by Verdi. But the role for which Mr. Gedda was very likely most famous was Russian: Lensky, the young poet in Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin.” Reviewing Mr. Gedda in a concert performance of “Onegin” with the Boston Symphony in 1976, Richard Dyer wrote in The Boston Globe: “The tenor’s voicing of Lensky’s aria — an ideal union of responsiveness to word and musical line, a demonstration of vocal and technical mastery and varied and beautiful tone, and an expression of wise and generous human feeling — was a classic demonstration of why, for some of us at least, operatic singing is the highest achievement of human art.” Mr. Gedda’s prowess in a Russian opera is perhaps unsurprising in light of the fact that Russian, along with Swedish, was his native language: He was abandoned as a child by one Russian father and reared by another. The permutations of Mr. Gedda’s name over time attest to the volatile nature of his childhood:
arts/music,According to his memoir, “Nicolai Gedda: My Life & Art,” published in English in 1999, he was born in Stockholm on July 11, 1925. The son of an unwed teenage waitress, Clary Linnea Lindstrom, and an unemployed father of Russian-Swedish parentage, Nikolai Gädda, he was christened Harry Gustaf Nikolai Gädda. His parents abandoned him at birth and planned to consign him to an orphanage. But when he was six days old, his father’s sister, Olga Gädda, intervened, determining to rear him as her own. A few years later, Olga married Michail Ustinoff, a Russian-born singer, and the child became known as Nikolai Ustinoff. As the British newspaper The Telegraph reported in its obituary of Mr. Gedda on Friday, Swedish authorities deemed the couple too poor to adopt him. “Nevertheless,” Mr. Gedda wrote in his memoir, “they had the courage to keep me illegally.” But the situation was far from idyllic. At the slightest infraction, Mr. Gedda wrote, his foster father would beat him with “a narrow Cossack belt that had once belonged to his uniform.” Mr. Gedda, who grew up speaking Russian and Swedish, believed for years that the Ustinoffs were his biological parents. It was not until he was an older teenager that he was told the circumstances of his birth. In 1929, when Michail Ustinoff became the choirmaster of a Russian Orthodox Church in Leipzig, the family moved there, and young Nikolai soon acquired German. His first voice lessons were with his foster father, and by the time he was 5, he was singing and playing the piano with facility.
arts/music,In 1934, after the rise of Hitler, the family left Germany and returned to Stockholm. He lived there with his foster parents until he was in his early 20s, sleeping in a tiny alcove off the kitchen of their modest apartment. After finishing high school, Mr. Gedda took a job as a bank clerk in Stockholm, earning extra money as a wedding singer. (He would adopt the name Nicolai Gedda early in his career.) Through a customer at the bank, he was introduced to the tenor Carl Martin Ohman, who had been a mentor of the renowned Swedish tenor Jussi Björling. Mr. Gedda began lessons with Mr. Ohman and later studied at what is now the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. Mr. Gedda made his operatic debut at 26, as the coachman Chapelou in “Le Postillon de Lonjumeau,” by the French composer Adolphe Adam, with the Royal Swedish Opera. His performance — notably the aria “Mes amis, écoutez l’histoire,” with its stratospheric high D, was rapturously received. Soon afterward, Mr. Gedda sang for Walter Legge, the influential classical record producer at EMI. As Opera News reported in its obituary of Mr. Gedda, on hearing him Mr. Legge sent telegrams to the conductor Herbert von Karajan and Antonio Ghiringhelli, who oversaw La Scala. “Just heard the greatest Mozart singer in my life,” his wires read. “His name is Nicolai Gedda.”
arts/music,From then on, Mr. Gedda never wanted for work. He made his La Scala debut as Don Ottavio in Mozart’s “Don Giovanni,” conducted by Mr. Karajan, in 1953. The next year he sang Faust at the Paris Opera and the Duke of Mantua at Covent Garden. Mr. Gedda made his United States debut in 1957, singing Faust with the Pittsburgh Opera. Reviewing his Met debut, in the same role later that year, under the baton of Jean Morel, Howard Taubman wrote in The New York Times: “His carriage is tall and straight and his movement buoyant. It is credible that he will attract Marguerite. Even more impressive than his appearance is the intelligence of his singing.” Mr. Gedda’s other Met roles over the years included Don Ottavio, Tamino in Mozart’s “The Magic Flute,” Admète in Gluck’s “Alceste,” Grigory in Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov” and Pinkerton in Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly.” With the Met, he also sang Anatol in the world premiere of Samuel Barber’s “Vanessa,” conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos, in 1958, and Kodanda in the United States premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti’s “The Last Savage,” under Thomas Schippers, in 1964. Mr. Gedda’s first two marriages ended in divorce. His survivors include his third wife, Aino Sellermark Gedda, the co-author of his memoir. Information on other survivors could not be confirmed. His recordings include many works in the standard repertoire, along with operettas and Leonard Bernstein’s “Candide.” Mr. Gedda never met his biological father. In 1977, when he was in his 50s, he met his biological mother for the first and only time.
arts/music,As he recounted in his memoir, when he entered her apartment in a Stockholm suburb, he noticed a large framed photograph of himself as a young singer, prominently displayed. He realized, he wrote, that she had purchased it from a photographic agency, as any stranger might have done.
nyregion,More Diversity in New York City’s Police Dept., but Blacks Lag - The New York Times It is among Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly’s prouder legacies: A majority of the police officers in New York City are now members of minorities, and have been since roughly 2006. But as the Police Department has attracted an increasingly kaleidoscopic range of nationalities to its ranks in recent years — officers hail from Albania to Yemen — department statistics reveal a decline in new recruits among black New Yorkers. The decline comes despite aggressive recruitment efforts in places like central Harlem and the Bronx, where the department regularly assigns friendly recruitment officers to visit. In 2003, 18 percent of the Police Academy’s 2,108 graduates were black. Of the 1,247 recruits who started the academy this summer and will graduate on Friday, blacks make up about 10 percent, according to the department. By contrast, the percentage of Hispanic recruits has remained around 25 percent from 2003 till now, and the percentage of white non-Hispanic recruits has actually risen in recent years, to 57 percent from 52 percent in 2003. There are many possible explanations for the decline, including demographic shifts in the city’s black population, a rise in the number of new immigrant applicants and possibly the highly publicized reduction of officers’ starting salary midway through the decade. (It was since raised to a base pay of about $42,000.)
nyregion,The Police Department’s aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics may have played a role as well. As the percentage of black recruits to the Police Academy zigzagged downward over the last decade, the number of recorded street stops, mostly in minority neighborhoods, rose higher, sowing distrust of the police. “I think most people are past saying ‘Oh, don’t be a cop,’ ” said Orayne Williams, 22, a senior at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who is from Flatbush, Brooklyn. “But it still does exist. People from the community have that mind-set.” Standing nearby, his friend Parris Bailey cut in. “I like the stop-and-frisk idea; they need to be able to do their job,” said Ms. Bailey, 21, who lives with her parents in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and counts “Law and Order” among her favorite shows. But she said she never considered being a police officer. “Defense attorney,” she said. Mr. Williams said he was preparing for the Law School Admissions Test, not the police exam. Police departments often struggle to diversify their ranks, and the New York Police Department has made strides over the last decade. It is roughly 30 percent Hispanic at the patrol level; it has more than doubled the number of Asian police officers since 2003; and it is slowly moving toward being majority minority across all ranks. (About 52 percent of the 34,000-member force was white at the start of 2013; 16 percent was black.)
nyregion,By contrast, at the Port Authority Police Department, blacks make up a small part of each academy class. Out of 217 graduates in 2012, 13 were black. That is up from just four in 2008, the last year of new recruits. Recruiters for the New York Police Department, who are officers themselves, pitch the job mostly for its benefits: compensation of over $90,000 after five and one-half years, the option to retire after 22 years with half pay and health care. The recruiting slogan is: “Be Proud.” At the start of the Bloomberg administration, attitudes toward the police in minority neighborhoods softened in anticipation of a shift from the law-and-order approach of Rudolph W. Giuliani and a string of police shootings of black men. Under Mr. Kelly, the department pushed to increase diversity while requiring two years of college credit or military service to enter the academy. Yet critics charge that police behavior in minority neighborhoods over the last decade has hindered efforts to attract black officers, alienating many young men and sowing broader resentment. “We had this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde recruitment strategy that played out in the community,” said State Senator Eric Adams, a retired police officer. “I had a conversation with Commissioner Kelly around this,” he added. “He had to acknowledge that the Police Department is not doing well at recruiting black men.”
nyregion,John J. McCarthy, the department’s chief spokesman, pointed to statistics showing the overall diversity of the department and that, since 2010, the percentage of blacks taking the Police Department exam had remained relatively constant, fluctuating between 17 and 20 percent of all test takers. Those who pass may not become officers for a variety of reasons, including residency requirements and background checks. (There is also now a two-and-a-half-year wait between the time an applicant takes the test and enters the academy, possibly dissuading some.) “Although the N.Y.P.D. is smaller than it was over a decade ago, the agency is more diverse than ever before,” Mr. McCarthy said. “In fact, the N.Y.P.D. is the most diverse police department anywhere in the world.” The incoming police commissioner, William J. Bratton, had to deal with similar apparent distrust in Los Angeles. Under his leadership, the department convened focus groups with African-American residents to learn of their concerns before trying aggressive recruiting. Some said they actively discouraged their children from joining the force. “One group that was particularly adamant against young black men joining were mothers who saw their sons, and in some cases their grandsons, jacked around over the years,” said John W. Mack, a former head of the Los Angeles Urban League and then president of that city’s police commission during Mr. Bratton’s tenure there. “And why would you want your sons to join a police force who was doing that?” The situation can be frustrating for black officers in New York.
nyregion,“This is a great job,” said Detective Yuseff Hamm, the president of the Guardians, a black fraternal organization that dates from 1942. “This is a great career. This is an absolute benefit to the citizens of New York. But a lot of people don’t look at it that way in the community.” Detective Hamm said the biggest challenge was attracting new black recruits who do not already have family members in law enforcement. Stop-and-frisk, he said, is just one of many concerns. “It comes up in them saying, ‘Is that what I would have to do?’ ” he said. More often, he said, the department’s educational requirements pose problems. “It’s necessary, but a hindrance at the same time,” he said. Census data shows that the number of blacks who could be eligible to be hired by the Police Department — 21- to 35-year-olds with at least two years of college living in the city or surrounding eligible counties — has increased since 2000. At the same time, said Susan Weber-Stoeger, a demographer at Queens College, the number represents a smaller percentage of all New Yorkers who fit that criteria. Outside John Jay College, Mitchell, 21, a black senior from Canarsie, Brooklyn, said he was in the process of joining the force in 2014. (He declined to give his last name for fear of violating department rules.) “All the cops there on Utica Avenue, the white cops, look scared,” he said of a thoroughfare that cuts through some minority areas. “What are you scared of? The black cops you see there, they’re relaxed.”

world/asia,In Myanmar, Karen Rebels Deny Signing a Cease-Fire - The New York Times TAY BAY HTA, MYANMAR — When Myanmar announced a cease-fire last month with one of the country’s most prominent rebel groups, images of longstanding enemies shaking hands across a table were beamed around the globe and touted as evidence of further reconciliation in a country emerging from decades of military dictatorship and interethnic strife. Now, three weeks after the deal was announced, the leadership of the rebel group is denying that a cease-fire was signed. “We can’t say there’s a cease-fire yet,” Naw Zipporah Sein, the general secretary of the Karen National Union, said in an interview. “We still need to discuss the conditions.” There have been no reports of clashes between Karen rebels and government troops in recent weeks. But the defiant stance of the Karen leadership appears to be a significant setback for the government’s efforts to end the grinding civil conflicts that have divided the country for decades. Reconciliation with the country’s armed ethnic groups has been one of the conditions that the United States and other Western countries have put on Myanmar before economic sanctions and other punitive measures are lifted. The day after the cease-fire announcement, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the U.S. secretary of state, said that the United States would reward “action with action” and announced that Washington would appoint an ambassador to Myanmar after more than a decade without one. She called the cease-fire an “important step forward” for the country.
world/asia,The confusion over the cease-fire remains murky and appears to be a mix of misunderstanding and backpedaling by the rebel group’s leadership. Ms. Sein said the delegation sent to negotiate with the government was not authorized to sign a cease-fire. A document was signed, but all that was agreed upon in January, she said, was that the two sides would “meet again” at the end of February. She declined to release a copy of the agreement. Top officials of the Karen National Union, a cash-strapped organization with a ragtag army of several thousand troops, also admit that they underestimated opposition from the organization’s rank and file to a deal with the government. “The grass roots are very much concerned that it went too quickly — they thought it was a sellout,” said Saw David Tharckabaw, vice president of the Karen National Union and chief of its foreign affairs section. “There is a feeling that we have been cheated.” The organization must now “move more slowly” in dealing with the government, Mr. Tharckabaw said. He portrays the cease-fire announcement in January as part of a public relations campaign by the government for the benefit of foreign nations. “The government wanted to show the world that the longest-running war between the government and a rebel group was over,” Mr. Tharckabaw said. He said the Karen delegation came under “high pressure” to sign an agreement. The government of President Thein Sein has pushed ahead with a raft of changes in recent months, including the release of hundreds of political prisoners and a loosening of restrictions on the news media.
world/asia,But ethnic strife remains a key challenge, one that has dogged Myanmar, also called Burma, from the first days of independence in 1948. E-mails to Mr. Thein Sein’s office seeking comment on the status of the Karen cease-fire were not answered. About one-third of Myanmar’s population are members of minority groups arrayed along the borders with Bangladesh, India, China and Thailand. In the impoverished hills that make up the Karen homeland, tensions persist between rebels and government troops, according to Bo Aung Hang, a battalion commander in charge of a region along the Moei River, which separates Myanmar from Thailand. The area is strewn with land mines. In Tay Bay Hta, a hamlet along the river without electricity or running water or roads, there is a palpable pessimism that is in stark contrast to the rekindled hopes for democratic reforms in some of Myanmar’s biggest cities. The mood here is for defiance, not reconciliation. During a ceremony this week to commemorate 63 years of fighting against the central government, Mr. Bo Aung Hang told an assembled group of about 150 villagers that the Burmese Army wanted to “eliminate the Karen people.” “All that will remain of the Karen is a picture in a library,” he said. As he spoke, rebel soldiers stood guard, carrying a variety of assault rifles and a grenade launcher. “Over the past 10 years, 40 soldiers have been killed in my battalion,” Mr. Bo Aung Hang said. “Those of us still alive are still leading the revolution.”
world/asia,Rebels call the central government the “enemy.” The leadership of the Karen National Union said that no date had been set for the next meeting with the government but that they are ready to respect the deadline and convene before the end of this month. The organization has submitted a sweeping list of 11 demands, including a call for a simultaneous cease-fire encompassing all ethnic groups. (Fighting has flared in recent weeks between ethnic Kachin rebels and the government along the border with China.) Mr. Tharckabaw, the vice president of the Karen National Union, summarizes the Karen demands as wanting “equality and self-determination.” “In short, we want a genuine federal system where the states will have their own autonomy,” he said. Villagers who over the last few decades have been in the cross-fire of one of Asia’s longest-running conflicts, are skeptical that a deal can be reached, said Bothien Thientha, a long-serving officer in the Karen National Liberation Army who was wounded in a battle with a pro-government militia two and a half years ago. “No one trusts the government,” he said. “We’ve been cheated so many times.”

world/asia,North Korea Claims Its Nuclear Arsenal Is Just a ‘Deterrent’ - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea — In a speech before his ruling Workers’ Party, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said on Saturday that his country would live up to its international commitment to nuclear nonproliferation, while trying to end the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula by using its “strong nuclear deterrent” as leverage against the United States. Mr. Kim presented what North Korea’s state media called an “ambitious blueprint” for his impoverished yet nuclear-armed country on Saturday, the second day of the Seventh Congress of his ruling Workers’ Party, the first such gathering in 36 years. Mr. Kim said that his country’s dealings with the outside world should be based on the fact that it has become a nuclear power — a status the United States has repeatedly vowed to not recognize. “Our party and government will struggle to root out the danger of nuclear war being imposed on us by the United States, based on our strong nuclear deterrent and defend peace in the region and in the world,” Mr. Kim said. His speech was carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Sunday. Mr. Kim said North Korea would act like “a responsible nuclear power” by not using a nuclear weapon unless its sovereignty is violated. “We will comply sincerely with our international commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and strive to achieve the denuclearization of the world,” he said.
world/asia,Mr. Kim also said his country was willing to improve ties with hostile countries if North Korea is treated with respect and as a friend. Mr. Kim’s comments appeared in line with what outside analysts have said has been shaping up as North Korean policy in recent years. The analysts also said North Korea wants the United States to accept it as a nuclear power and sign a peace treaty in exchange for a commitment not to grow its nuclear arsenal or export nuclear weapons knowledge. North Korea has indicated in recent years that it can discuss its nuclear disarmament only in the context of global denuclearization. But Washington has insisted it can start dialogue with Pyongyang only when it agrees that it will abandon its nuclear weapons program. But senior North Korean officials attending the party congress vowed to expand their country’s nuclear arsenal, and claimed an ability to strike the United States with nuclear weapons. “Our means of nuclear strikes are ready to launch any time, targeting American imperialists’ bases of invasion in the Asia-Pacific region and the mainland United States,” Vice Marshal Ri Myong-su, the chief of the Korean People’s Army’s General Staff, said on Saturday. Vice Marshal Ri, one of Mr. Kim’s top aides, said that if there were an order from Mr. Kim, his military would launch nuclear strikes to “liberate” South Korea and “completely erase the United States off the face of the earth.”
world/asia,North Korea had previously made similar threats and claims about its nuclear capabilities. But remarks by senior officials during the congress showed that Mr. Kim was using the rare political gathering to rally the party behind his so-called “byungjin” policy. On Saturday, Mr. Kim said that policy was not a temporary step but his party’s “permanent strategic line.” The byungjin — or “parallel advance” — policy calls for stockpiling nuclear weapons in the belief that the deterrent would allow the country to focus on economic recovery. Since taking power four years ago, Mr. Kim has adopted it as his national strategy, despite warnings from Washington and Seoul that it would further isolate his already heavily sanctioned country. Vice Marshal Ri’s comments were reported by the North’s state-run Pyongyang Radio and Korean Central Broadcasting Station, also a radio network. United States and South Korean officials doubted that North Korea has developed a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that would deliver a nuclear payload to the continental United States. Its three tests of the intermediate-range ballistic missile Musudan, which is believed to have a range long enough to reach United States military bases in Guam, all failed last month, with the projectiles crashing to the sea or exploding shortly after liftoff, they said. But under Mr. Kim, North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile program. He presented his nuclear weapons program as his key achievement during the party congress, which served as a platform to cement his grip on power.
world/asia,“It is our unshakable determination that because the Workers’ Party has its byungjin line, there is nothing we cannot conquer in nuclear armament,” said another senior party official, Wang Chang-wuk, according to the North Korean radio reports. “We are determined to push through the party’s decision on building a nuclear might and to develop and make more diverse and advanced nuclear weapons of our own style.” On Saturday, a parade of top party officials spoke at the congress, idolizing Mr. Kim, who is believed to be in his early 30s, for “ushering in a great heyday in strengthening” North Korea, said the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. In his review of policies on Saturday, they said, Mr. Kim provided “an encyclopedic political program giving a perfect solution to all problems.” More than 3,400 delegates from across North Korea were attending the congress, the first since 1980, when Mr. Kim’s grandfather, the North’s founding President Kim Il-sung, was in charge. The congress will elect a new party leadership, reaffirming Mr. Kim at the top post, the North Korean media said.

world/asia,Saudis Bankroll Taliban, Even as King Officially Supports Afghan Government - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — Fifteen years, half a trillion dollars and 150,000 lives since going to war, the United States is trying to extricate itself from Afghanistan. Afghans are being left to fight their own fight. A surging Taliban insurgency, meanwhile, is flush with a new inflow of money. With their nation’s future at stake, Afghan leaders have renewed a plea to one power that may hold the key to whether their country can cling to democracy or succumbs to the Taliban. But that power is not the United States. It is Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is critical because of its unique position in the Afghan conflict: It is on both sides. A longtime ally of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia has backed Islamabad’s promotion of the Taliban. Over the years, wealthy Saudi sheikhs and rich philanthropists have also stoked the war by privately financing the insurgents. All the while, Saudi Arabia has officially, if coolly, supported the American mission and the Afghan government and even secretly sued for peace in clandestine negotiations on their behalf. The contradictions are hardly accidental. Rather, they balance  conflicting needs within the kingdom, pursued through both official policy and private initiative. The dual tracks allow Saudi officials plausibly to deny official support for the Taliban, even as they have turned a blind eye to private funding of the Taliban and other hard-line Sunni groups.
world/asia,The result is that the Saudis — through private or covert channels — have tacitly supported the Taliban in ways that make the kingdom an indispensable power broker. In interviews with The New York Times, a former Taliban finance minister described how he traveled to Saudi Arabia for years raising cash while ostensibly on pilgrimage. The Taliban have also been allowed to raise millions more by extorting “taxes” by pressing hundreds of thousands of Pashtun guest workers in the kingdom and menacing their families back home, said Vali Nasr, a former State Department adviser. Yet even as private Saudi money backed the Taliban, Saudi intelligence once covertly mediated a peace effort that Taliban officials and others involved described in full to The Times for the first time. Playing multiple sides of the same geopolitical equation is one way the Saudis further their own strategic interests, analysts and officials say. But it also threatens to undermine the fragile democratic advances made by the United States in the past 15 years, and perhaps undo efforts to liberalize the country. The United States now finds itself trying to persuade its putative ally to play a constructive rather than destructive role. Meanwhile, the Afghans have come to view Saudi Arabia as both friend and foe. The question now, as Afghan officials look for help, is which Saudi Arabia will they get? Prince Turki al-Faisal, who led the Saudi intelligence agency for over 24 years and later served as ambassador to the United States until his retirement in 2007, rejected any suggestion that Saudi Arabia had ever supported the Taliban.
world/asia,“When I was in government, not a single penny went to the Taliban,” he wrote in emailed comments. He added that the “stringent measures taken by the kingdom to prevent any transfer of money to terrorist groups” had been recognized by Daniel L. Glaser, the United States assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the Treasury, in testimony to Congress in June. Others say the verdict is still out. “We know there has been this financing that has gone on for years,” Hanif Atmar, director of the Afghan National Security Council, said in an interview. “This sustains the terrorist war machine in Afghanistan and in the region, and it will have to be stopped.” That may be easier said than done. Saudi Arabia remains one of the main sources of what Secretary of State John Kerry recently called “surrogate money” to support Islamist fighters and causes. Much of that largess is spread about in pursuit of what Mr. Nasr describes as a Saudi strategy of building a wall of Sunni radicalism across South and Central Asia to contain Iran, its Shia rival. That competition is being rekindled. With the Americans leaving, there is the sense that Afghanistan’s fate is up for grabs. In recent months, the Taliban has mounted a coordinated offensive with about 40,000 fighters across eight provinces — a push financed by foreign sources at a cost of $1 billion, Afghan officials say.
world/asia,At the same time, Saudi Arabia is offering the Afghan government substantial defense and development agreements, while Afghans say sheikhs from Saudi Arabia and other Arab Persian Gulf states are quietly funneling billions in private money to Sunni organizations, madrasas and universities to shape the next generation of Afghans. “The Saudis are re-engaging,” said Mr. Nasr, now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, in a telephone interview. “Afghanistan is important to them, which is why they invested so much in the 1980s, and they are looking to make themselves much more relevant.” The seven-year Taliban theocracy in Afghanistan was coming to a fiery end. It was 2001, and the Taliban government was collapsing under United States bombing unleashed in retaliation for the Sept. 11 attacks. Disguising himself as a doctor, Agha Jan Motasim, the Taliban finance minister, escaped over a remote border crossing into Pakistan aboard a Red Crescent ambulance, he said in a recent interview. In the Pakistani border town of Quetta, he and other Taliban leaders regrouped and began organizing the insurgency that continues today. Mr. Motasim was appointed head of the finance committee. One of his first stops was Saudi Arabia. As home to both enormous oil wealth and Islam’s holiest sites, it was the perfect place to make appeals not only to rich Saudi sheikhs and foundations but also to important donors who traveled to the kingdom on pilgrimage from all over the Muslim world.
world/asia,Between 2002 and 2007, Mr. Motasim traveled to Saudi Arabia two or three times a year. Ostensibly he went on pilgrimage, but his primary purpose was to raise cash for the Taliban. “There were people coming from other countries for umrah and hajj,” he said referring to the different Muslim pilgrimages. “Also the Saudi sheikhs would come as well. I would ask them for their help for the war.” “It was not only the Saudis who would help us but people who would come from different countries,” he recalled. “Saudi Arabia was the only country where I could meet them.” Once secured, the money could be moved in myriad ways to Taliban coffers, officials said, including through regional banks near Pakistan’s tribal areas and the hawala system of informal money-changers. Last year, Afghan security forces even discovered families of Al Qaeda members entering eastern Afghanistan with a stash of gold bars, Rahmatullah Nabil, former head of Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said. The Saudi authorities often say they cannot control or always identify the millions of Muslims who travel to the kingdom every year on the hajj, said Barnett Rubin, who worked as special adviser to the United States envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban always traveled on fake Pakistani passports under assumed names and were unknown to Saudi authorities, said a security official in the region, who spoke on condition of strict anonymity, citing the extreme sensitivity to upsetting Saudi Arabia.
world/asia,American requests to cut the funding yielded little result. In 2009, American officials complained that the Taliban and other extremist groups were raising millions of dollars during annual pilgrimages, according to American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. A December 2009 cable from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that donors in Saudi Arabia constituted the “most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” The cables date from a period when Richard C. Holbrooke, who died in 2010, acted as special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and actively sought to curb funding to the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The funding from the gulf extended well beyond that period and to other groups besides the Taliban, including the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In a leaked email from 2014, Mrs. Clinton described the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia as “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” Financing such groups, she wrote, was part of a contest between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who were in “ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world.” It was September 2008, the holy month of Ramadan, and King Abdullah was hosting an iftar dinner in Mecca. But this was no routine breaking of the fast at sunset. The feast was an important signal of the king’s personal support for a covert yet still evolving peace effort. Among the dozens of guests were Afghan officials and elders, as well as former Taliban members.
world/asia,Within months, at a more discreet venue in the Red Sea port of Jidda, the Saudi intelligence agency convened Afghanistan’s chief adversaries to hash out a peace deal. Mr. Motasim, the same man who had been collecting money for the insurgency, was named by the Taliban as its representative. On the other side, the emissary for President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan was his brother, Qayum Karzai. During three days of intense discussions — breaking at intervals when the men locked horns — a Saudi intermediary nudged the two sides forward. The peace effort had begun in 2006. The initial broker was Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who had won credibility by fighting the Soviets for 10 years in Afghanistan. In an interview, Mr. Anas said his decision to seek out the Saudis as a third-party mediator was obvious, because of the kingdom’s special status as home to Islam’s two holiest sites and its support during the fight against the Soviet occupation. “Even in a very far village in Afghanistan, Saudi means something,” said Mr. Anas, who today runs Al Magharibia, a satellite television channel based in London. Still, getting the Saudis on board took some persuading. The events of 9/11 had deeply embarrassed them. Both the kingdom and the United States had nurtured the mujahedeen to push out a Soviet occupation in the 1980s, but the subsequent behavior of the Taliban infuriated the Americans. Harboring Osama bin Laden was the last straw. For the Saudis, it was more complicated.
world/asia,Even when the Taliban refused to hand over Bin Laden — Prince Turki, the Saudi intelligence chief, requested it in person in 1998 — the kingdom still did not break with them. Saudi Arabia supported the Taliban government up to 2001 and beyond, in alignment with Pakistan, the kingdom’s main ally to check Iranian influence in the region. “The problem is Saudi Arabia sees Afghanistan through the lenses of Pakistan,” Mr. Anas said, describing a prime challenge of his peace initiative. To achieve peace, Mr. Anas said he wanted to encourage the Saudis to build a relationship with Afghanistan directly. People involved in the effort — who spoke on condition of anonymity because the process was conducted in confidentiality — say King Abdullah was moved to back the effort out of a sense of compassion. He did so, they said, even in the face of resistance from other Saudi royals who were unhappy with the American occupation. Yet others were wary of further involvement in Afghanistan. To overcome Saudi reluctance, Mr. Anas took the Saudi emissary to Afghanistan to show that it remained a freely practicing Muslim society, despite the presence of American troops. President Karzai wrote King Abdullah, who had ascended to the throne in August 2005, a deferential letter requesting his intercession. It worked. King Abdullah met the Afghan leader at the door of his plane on a pilgrimage visit. Mr. Karzai still speaks highly of his friendship with King Abdullah, who died in 2015.
world/asia,“He would never, never, never leave my call unanswered,” he recounted in an interview. “The same day he would get back to me, talk to me and do all that I asked.” The Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz, personally oversaw the negotiations, sending his emissary between Mr. Motasim of the Taliban and the Afghan government for two years. But when talks neared a critical endpoint, the Taliban were gripped by a vicious power struggle. The Saudi demand that the Taliban renounce terrorism and its ties to Al Qaeda was never met. Mr. Motasim was accused of embezzlement and removed. The next year, 2010, his main protector, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s chief operational commander, was arrested in Pakistan, while an assassin shot Mr. Motasim and left him for dead outside his home in Karachi, though he survived. Both events were interpreted as Pakistan’s opposition to any peace process being negotiated without its participation, several of those involved in the process say. “It was then that this process was sabotaged,” Mr. Motasim said. King Abdullah intimated to President Karzai in 2010 that there were obstructions beyond his control. “I wish to help Afghanistan,” Mr. Karzai recalled the king’s saying. “I want it to be peaceful, I want you to sit down and talk to the Taliban, but you must recognize that all I can do is what Saudi can do. “That was a very meaningful word,” Mr. Karzai concluded, “meaning that there were other forces who were probably not willing to allow this to happen.”
world/asia,Despite those covert efforts, the Saudi kingdom, publicly and officially, has been largely absent in Afghanistan. While paying lip service to the American mission, Saudi Arabia has not built a significant project in its own name in Afghanistan in 15 years. Yet official Saudi neglect stands in stark contrast to the wealth of private Saudi funding that has done more than bolster the Taliban and allied militant groups in the region. It has also spawned hundreds of universities, madrasas and radical groups that have extended Sunni influence and that Afghans fear are sowing seeds of future turmoil. One of those Afghans is Nisar Karimzai, who runs a small research office, the Organization for Research of Peace and Stability. During the Soviet occupation, Mr. Karimzai went to school in Pakistan, where he fell in with a Sunni extremist crowd. “They teach that the Shia are not Muslim,” he recalled, referring to Shiites. He eventually discarded extremist thinking. But his own experience made him wary when he saw a cousin become involved with an Islamist group called Jamiat Eslah. “I recognize the way they are training them,” Mr. Karimzai said. “It was exactly the same way they taught me. “Personally I am scared,” Mr. Karimzai added. “In five years we will face a danger from them. One day they will fight and we will have a very big problem.” Jamiat Eslah promotes a strict Islamist worldview and describes itself as a self-financed, nonpolitical organization focused on humanitarian and educational work.
world/asia,But the size of its operations, with 40 to 50 buildings including offices, a university and a hospital, indicates substantial outside funding, said Mr. Nabil, a former head of Afghan intelligence. The group’s bank accounts show no foreign bank transfers, according to an internal government report. Nevertheless, the report concluded that the group is financed by sources in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The group is just one of a proliferating number that have sprouted in recent years as Sunni Arabs from the Persian Gulf compete with Shiite Iran for influence here. The Iranians, too, have been busy building madrasas, universities and cultural centers for the Shiite population, and even a road to the border with Iran. The rivalry underlying the scale of such competing funding, Afghan officials and others warn, spells trouble. In 2001, Afghanistan had just 1,000 madrasas. Today, there are more than 4,000, the majority of them built in the last few years. After a summer and fall of violent attacks, including at the American University of Afghanistan  and against Shiite gatherings, Afghans worry at the growing sectarian tilt of Sunni extremist groups. Hajji Abdul Qahar Abed, who serves as chief of staff to the chief executive of the government, Abdullah Abdullah, warns that after decades of war and dislocation, Afghans are particularly vulnerable. “My personal fear is that their associates will lead them somewhere that will hurt the people again,” he said of Jamiat Eslah.
world/asia,Another youth movement gaining traction is Hisb ut-Tahrir, a secretive, anti-establishment group that has a wide underground following in Central Asia, according to several government officials. Officials and former insiders of the group said they believed it was funded by foreigners including Saudis and other gulf Arabs, as well as donors in Egypt and Europe. “They want to reach as many people as they can and bring them into the party and eventually strengthen their ranks and announce a caliphate,” said Massoud Rahimi, a student at Kabul University, who said he declined when a cousin tried to recruit him. “It is going to put Afghanistan on the road of conflict,” he said. Upon his election 2014, Afghanistan’s current president, Ashraf Ghani, chose Saudi Arabia for his first official trip. Then five months later, after a second trip to meet the new Saudi king, Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, Mr. Ghani pledged Afghan support for the Saudi military coalition for Yemen. In return, Mr. Ghani wanted Saudi Arabia’s rulers to stop the flow of funds from rich Saudi sheikhs to the Taliban and encourage the Taliban back into negotiations. “The signs are positive,” said Mr. Atmar of the National Security Council. “We have not yet seen concrete movements against this, but we believe that we have a strong commitment.” Yet other Afghan officials and local diplomats are deeply skeptical. One diplomat in Kabul said tracking the flow of illegal money was virtually impossible. Another, who had served in Saudi Arabia, doubted that Riyadh would change, adding that the vast royal family is split into fiefs often working at odds with each other.
world/asia,The scale of the Taliban’s recent offensive also has left many Afghans wary. “The level of finance, the level of logistical support in terms of weapons and other materials, and the level of organizational support in terms of leadership of the war they have received is unprecedented,” said Nader Nadery, chief adviser on strategic affairs to the president. “It clearly indicates a declared war against Afghanistan,” he added, accusing Pakistan, the stalwart Saudi ally. Mr. Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, recently led a delegation to Saudi Arabia. They went seeking investment, but also asked Saudi leaders to press Pakistan to end its safe haven for terrorists, a request President Karzai also made repeatedly. “They said they will do that, and they said they will try in the gulf region to use their influence to mobilize against terrorism,” said Nasrullah Arsalai, director general of the council of ministers secretariat in Afghanistan, who was part of the delegation.  “Saudi Arabia knows if we fight together, it means the Taliban will not be able to bring money from there,” he said. Yet Ruhullah Wakil, a tribal elder who is now a member of the Afghan peace council says he, too, recently beseeched Saudi officials to sponsor the work of the council, which is authorized to pursue negotiations. The Saudis were uninterested. “They are deaf,” he said. “We asked them to help. We asked them even just to give us some dates to serve to guests. “But they gave us nothing.”

opinion/sunday,Life During Wartime in Syria - The New York Times WHAT does it feel like when a war begins? When does life as you know it implode? How do you know when it is time to pack up your home and your family and leave your country? Or if you decide not to, why? For ordinary people, war starts with a jolt: one day you are busy with dentist appointments or arranging ballet lessons for your daughter, and then the curtain drops. One moment the daily routine grinds on; A.T.M.’s work and cellphones function. Then, suddenly, everything stops. Barricades go up. Soldiers are recruited and neighbors work to form their own defense. Ministers are assassinated and the country falls into chaos. Fathers disappear. The banks close and money and culture and life as people knew it vanishes. In Damascus, this moment has come. I spent nearly two weeks in Syria earlier this month; I was privileged — and lucky — to get a visa because there is a near-total media blackout. The fear that rises with civil war was palpable. Car bombs exploded in the streets; there was a shootout in a television station. The week after I was in Damascus, the Red Cross declared the 17-month uprising a civil war, which means that international human rights law applies throughout the country. More essentially it means that Syrians can’t any longer deny, as some did, that their country is at war and that the life they’ve lived is rapidly coming to an end.
opinion/sunday,During my time in Syria, daily life unfolded as it does everywhere in the world. I attended operas at one of the best opera houses in the Middle East, Dionysian pool parties on Thursday afternoons, weddings, in which couples married in elaborate Sunni and Shia ceremonies, and, watched makeup artists do their magic on actresses’ faces for a magazine photo shoot: all of these activities are part of a life that somehow continued as war crept up Syria’s doorstep but is about to fade away, except as memory. Not far beneath the surface of the festivities, there was a current of tension, a tangible dread that the 17-month conflict would soon spill onto the streets of Damascus. People had begun to leave Damascus when I arrived. There were going-away parties, and embassies were shutting down. The neighborhoods of Barzah and al-Midan, where I walked the streets two weeks ago after Friday Prayer, are now no-go areas, opposition strongholds. Then it was tense to talk in the street after Friday Prayer, or to try to talk to rebel supporters. Now it will be bloodier. And I wonder how many of the people I saw two weeks ago are now fleeing Syria, crossing over the border to Lebanon.
opinion/sunday,I know about the velocity of war. In all of the wars I have covered — including in Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Chechnya, Kosovo — the moments in which everything changes from normal to extremely abnormal share a similar quality. One evening in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, in 2002, for example, I went to bed after dinner at a lavish French restaurant. When I woke up, there was no telephone service and no radio broadcast in the capital; “rebels” occupied the television station and flares shot through the sky. In my garden I could smell both the scent of mango trees and the smell of burning homes. My neighborhood was on fire. The 24-hour gap between peace and wartime gave me enough time to gather my passport, computer and favorite photos and flee to a hotel in the center of the city. I never returned to my beloved house with the mango trees. In early April of 1992, a friend in Sarajevo was walking, in a miniskirt and heels, to her job in a bank when she saw a tank rolling down the street. Shots were fired. My friend crouched, trembling, behind a garbage can, her life forever altered. In a few weeks, she was sending her baby to safety on a bus in the arms of a stranger to another country. She would not see him for years.
opinion/sunday,MAJ. GEN. ROBERT MOOD of Norway, the chief United Nations monitor in Damascus, told me there is no template for war. But reading dispatches from the village of Tremseh and seeing the refugees fleeing Homs with mattresses strapped to their car rooftops, the tiny faces of children pressed against the window, it is hard not to remember the mistakes of the past two decades. As Russia continues to veto Security Council efforts to sanction and reproach President Bashar al-Assad, friends in Syria e-mail and tweet about assassinations, brutal killings, doctors torturing victims. It is hard not see another Bosnia looming. Syrians who called themselves Syrians a few months ago now say they are Alawites, Christians, Sunnis, Shias, Druze. Diplomacy is failing. Kofi Annan, who has a godlike demeanor, stood on the sidelines and watched as genocide unfolded in Bosnia and Rwanda while he was in charge of peacekeeping operation. Now he is pleading with the Assad regime to agree to a cease-fire. In every war I have covered, cease-fire is a synonym for buying time to kill more civilians. Thirteen years ago, Mr. Annan issued a report to the General Assembly on the failure of the international community to prevent the massacre of Bosnians at Srebrenica. He called it “a horror without parallel in the history of Europe since the Second World War.” Yet once again the member states lack the will or impetus to stop the slaughter of women, children and innocents. As they bicker and squabble over reports and sit in hotel rooms unable to be the eyes and ears on the ground and report what is happening, more people die.
opinion/sunday,This is what the beginning of civil war looks like. IN the time I spent in Syria earlier this month, I talked to as many people from as many denominations and backgrounds as possible. I wanted to see how Assad supporters told the story of what was happening to their country. And I wanted testimonies from those who suffered under the regime. On the two-hour drive from Damascus to Homs, I went through eight government checkpoints. Inside, the half of the city that was not leveled by tanks and fighting was semi-functioning: the shrubbery in the center of the road had been left to grow wildly, but a bus passed through to collect a few people lingering. It was a strange sign of normalcy. At a crowded refugee center, I met a woman named Sopia who last saw her 23-year-old son, Muhammad, in a Homs hospital bed in December. She told me that shrapnel hit him during a mortar attack and a piece had lodged in his brain. Sopia said she arrived at his bed one morning and found it empty. Doctors explained to her that they had moved him to a military hospital. Sopia said she had a “terrible feeling” as she began to search desperately for her son. She found Muhammad’s body — 10 days later — in the military hospital. It bore clear signs of torture: there were two bullets lodged in his head, electrocution marks on the soles of his feet and around his ankles and cigarette burns on his back.
opinion/sunday,For Sopia, the morning she saw her son’s body was the moment she realized she was in a country at war. She told me her son was a simple man, a construction worker, and had no links to the rebels. But Sopia and her family lived in Baba Amr — an area of Homs that had been an opposition stronghold — and men of a certain age are assumed to be fighters or supporters of the Free Syrian Army. I asked Sopia over and over whether her son was a fighter. No, she said, he wasn’t. Sopia’s grief was not unlike that of the mothers of government fighters, about the same age as Muhammad, who had been killed in Damascus by improvised explosive devices or flying shrapnel. To them and to Sopia, politics seems to matter less than raw pain, inconsolable loss. Armed soldiers at roadblocks throughout the country check passing cars for guns and soldiers. Suspicious passengers are detained for questioning. On my way to Homs, polite but menacing pro-Assad gunmen detained me, my translator and her mother at one checkpoint for several hours. (We were released only after the translator’s mother, an elderly Syrian woman, begged them to release us so she could take needed heart medication.) In Homs, I met a little boy who sat on a parquet floor playing Go Fish. For him, the war started when Syria’s Arab Spring began in March of 2011. Then, his parents forbade him to leave the house. Now there is a sniper at the end of his street, and in the evening mortar rounds thunder in the dark, and get louder as night wears on.
opinion/sunday,The little boy lives near the ghostly ruins of Baba Amr where the air outside his balcony is still rich with the scent of jasmine, olive trees and orange blossoms. If he went inside and closed his eyes, it would be possible for him to believe no war was going on outside. The boy’s family does not support Mr. Assad; in fact, the boy’s grandmother vehemently loathes him. But they are not leaving. Why? The boy’s mother told me they are staying because this is their home. Life here is already like life in a prison, a sense that will only worsen. The boy has one DVD, a pirated version of “Home Alone” that he watches over and over when the electricity is on. He misses his friends, most of whom have fled. Back in Damascus, I sat on another jasmine-scented roof terrace chatting with an elegant Syrian architect. Her two children played inside as we sipped tea on the terrace and I wondered how much longer she would remain in the country. I went to a Children’s Orchestra of Syria rehearsal and heard a scratchy version of Evening Prayer from the opera “Hansel and Gretel.” Watching the children and their young, earnest faces as they played their oboes and flutes, I wondered how many would die, how many would flee, how many would stay and fight in the days ahead. I visited a military hospital in Barzah where I watched the mangled, broken bodies of 50 government soldiers roll off bloody stretchers and into coffins in preparation for a mass funeral.
opinion/sunday,Hospital workers — outfitted with masks that probably offered little protection against the stench of death — covered each coffin with a Syrian flag; a band played the death march. The hospital director told me that 15 government soldiers die each day. But there is no way to check those figures, or to tabulate the number of civilian deaths. The United Nations says 10,000 have been killed, but humanitarian activists say the total is closer to 17,000. IN war, it’s said, truth dies first. As war proceeds in Syria, people search for truth. In Homs, Sopia looks for an answer to the question of why her wounded son was tortured so brutally. In Damascus a young activist tells me over a tiny cup of coffee that she is not afraid to go to jail again for protesting peacefully. She uses a false name and moves often. She can’t communicate openly on her cellphone or by Skype. “I believe in what I am doing,” she said. “I am not afraid.” She wants to live in a country that is truthful and free from dictatorial rule. In a government office near the Mezze Highway, a Christian official with a Muslim name says he grew up in a country that, like Bosnia, was a melting pot for ethnic groups, for refugees from Armenia, for Christians, Shias, Sunnis and Greek Orthodox. He says the uprising will change all of this. “Everyone who believed in the Syrian model is betrayed,” he said.
opinion/sunday,In the old town of Damascus, a famous artist sat in his studio — a room in the former home of a Jewish family who used it to keep their sacred Torah — and said the war was edging closer. Two years ago, before the Arab Spring, he expressed his vision of the future of the Middle East in a sculptural exhibition called “Guillotine,” in downtown Damascus. Now if he paints a picture, he says, “A lot of people are in pieces.”

us,Critics Seek To Overturn Abortion Rule - The New York Times A bipartisan group of lawmakers mounted a drive in the House and Senate today to overturn the new Bush administration policy on international family planning assistance, which they argue is counterproductive and cruel. At issue is an order President Bush signed on his third day in office, reimposing the ''Mexico City policy'' of the administrations of the elder President Bush and Ronald Reagan. That policy bans federal aid to organizations that use their own money to perform or ''actively promote'' abortions, whether through counseling, public information campaigns or lobbying to legalize abortions. An array of legislators argued today that the policy would hamstring many clinics that are critical to women's health services abroad, potentially resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and more unsafe abortions. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said the rule presented family planning groups ''with a dangerous choice.'' ''If you want to participate in U.S. programs,'' Ms. Lowey said, ''you have to withhold vital information from patients. You have to sacrifice your right to free speech. And you have to stop providing legal health services with your own, non-U.S. funds.'' Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, argued that the rule was particularly harsh because the clinics affected were often the only source of medical care for women in a large area. There is, she said, nowhere else to go if the one local clinic must abide by the Mexico City policy (named for the 1984 population conference where the Reagan administration announced it).
us,''It is ethically wrong and it is morally wrong,'' Ms. Johnson said. The legislation introduced today has 50 sponsors in the House, including 6 Republicans, Ms. Lowey said. It has 15 sponsors in the Senate, including Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and 4 other Republicans. Senator Snowe, in a statement, described the Bush policy as ''confounding to me,'' arguing that strong family planning programs reduced the number of abortions. Sponsors said they were more optimistic about their chances in the Senate than in the House, but acknowledged it would be a struggle. Abortion opponents said they were confident they could hold the line. They said there was not enough support in the House and even if there were, President Bush would veto it. The United States Agency for International Development issued a bulletin today on the requirements for groups seeking aid; $425 million in family planning money became available under the new rules. A spokeswoman for the agency said the bulletin essentially restated the previous policy. But, she added, it tries to clarify that clinics are not prohibited from treating women who are ill from legal or illegal abortions obtained elsewhere. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and a sponsor of the bill, said today, ''Well, isn't that compassionate?'' The development agency has said it expects most groups to abide by the rules. A group of anti-abortion members of Congress hailed the policy today, saying that it was wrong to use ''taxpayer money to push abortion in third world countries,'' in the words of Representative Joseph R. Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania.
us,Advocates of family planning said today that the policy bans what groups can do with their own money, constituting a significant restriction in political freedoms that would not be allowed in the United States.

nyregion,Concorde Loses Its Nose Cone in an Accident in Brooklyn - The New York Times The supersonic passenger jet known as Alpha Delta retired unscathed in 2003 after nearly 30 years of speeding back and forth over the Atlantic Ocean. But in less than two years in Brooklyn, it already has had its pointy nose knocked off. In a multicultural crash in the middle of the night, the jet, a Concorde that is owned by a British airline, was hit by a truck that was hauling equipment from a Jamaican music and soccer festival. The truck clipped the distinctive nose cone off the parked Anglo-French jet about 3 a.m. last Monday, prompting an impassioned uproar among the jet’s band of enthusiasts. To many admirers, the tapered nose, which could be lowered up to 12.5 degrees to clear the pilots’ field of vision during the jet’s steeply angled takeoffs and landings, was what made the Concorde the Concorde. Within 20 hours of the accident, photos of the damaged plane appeared on the Internet, and Concorde lovers were deploring the level of care it had received during its postretirement odyssey in New York. Bill White, the man responsible for maintenance of the 32-year-old jet, said he learned of the damage indirectly through the Concorde’s fan club. The plane is in Mr. White’s charge because he is the president of the foundation that operates the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. After British Airways retired its fleet of Concordes, the airline leased the jet to the museum, which displayed it on a barge in the Hudson River.
nyregion,But when the Intrepid, the aircraft carrier that houses the museum, had to temporarily abandon its rotting pier on the West Side of Manhattan in late 2006, the Concorde had to go, too. British Airways considers the plane a three-dimensional billboard for its service, and it did not want the Concorde to stay with the Intrepid, which is docked at Staten Island and is closed while the West Side pier is being refurbished. So Mr. White found a temporary home for the jet at Aviator Sports, a recreational complex at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. The Concorde, which had traveled by barge to Manhattan from Kennedy International Airport in 2004, retraced most of that voyage en route to Aviator Sports. The jet’s stay there has been more turbulent than a trans-Atlantic crossing at Mach 2. Shortly after agreeing to rent the plane for $15,000 a month during the Intrepid’s absence, the original operators of Aviator Sports sold out. Their successors have balked at honoring the previous managers’ pledge to pay for the plane’s return to the Hudson waterfront, Mr. White said. The cost of that trip has been estimated at $250,000. Mr. White said he was perturbed that the current operators of the complex did not notify him of the damage right away. He said he expected the cost of replacing the nose cone to be covered by Aviator Sports’s insurance policy.
nyregion,He said he had been told that a driver “smacked the front end of the Concorde with his truck.” He added that Intrepid museum officials would “take steps with Aviator to secure the aircraft so that this kind of a ridiculous happening won’t happen again.” Salvatore Musumeci, the director of security at the complex, said, “It was an unfortunate thing that happened, and everyone here is upset about it.” He said he did not know who would pay for the repairs. John Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways, said the airline expected the jet to be fixed and returned to the Manhattan pier by the end of the year. Replacement parts for Concordes are no longer being manufactured, but Mr. Lampl said the airline knew of collectors who had bought spare nose cones at an auction. He said he expected that Intrepid officials could buy one from one of those enthusiasts.
world/asia,Hong Kong Told to Strive for a ‘Less Perfect’ Democracy - The New York Times HONG KONG — On the eve of a decision by Beijing on rules for elections in Hong Kong, a top Chinese scholar presented a series of justifications on Thursday for why the territory’s more than seven million people should temper demands for Western-style democracy, insisting that a “less perfect” version of democracy is better than none at all. Hong Kong is set to pick its top official, the chief executive, by a popular vote starting in 2017. China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, is expected to give guidance in the coming days on how it should implement the elections. Beijing has taken the position that candidates must be vetted by a nominating committee, which democracy activists and pro-establishment figures alike say will screen out anyone seen as unacceptable by Beijing. Speaking in Hong Kong on Thursday, Wang Zhenmin, dean of the law school at Tsinghua University in Beijing, who advises the central government on Hong Kong issues, said “no democracy in the world” was perfect. “The overwhelming majority of the people in Hong Kong and the central authorities would like to see universal suffrage in 2017,” he said. “We should not let the people down. More is less, less is more. Less perfect universal suffrage is better than no universal suffrage. Leave some room for future growth.”
world/asia,Mr. Wang, who visited Hong Kong under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make its case for the new rules, also assured Hong Kong residents that contrary to published reports, the territory’s independent courts would be respected and flourish in coming years, as China itself moved toward a more rules-based system. He said reports that judges would be subject to a political requirement of “loving the country” were the result of mistranslations of a Chinese white paper. But the meat of his presentation focused on the election rules in the former British colony. One person familiar with the deliberations in Beijing, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the discussions, said the Congress would almost certainly insist that candidates be vetted by a nominating committee that would restrict the public from putting forth candidates. Democrats in the Hong Kong legislature have vowed to block any measure that does not allow for free and fair elections, and a broad coalition of citizens, including religious leaders, students and even some members of the city’s financial community, have vowed to stage large protests that may disrupt business in Asia’s top financial center if the government’s plan limits who can be on the ballot.
world/asia,Mr. Wang acknowledged that there was mistrust over Beijing’s intentions in Hong Kong, which is run separately from the rest of China under an agreement with Britain that paved the way for the return of Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Hong Kong citizens enjoy civil liberties, including freedoms of assembly, speech and religion, that are not available elsewhere in China. Many Hong Kong residents fear that such autonomy is being eroded, citing recent pressure on the media and a controversial policy document issued by Beijing earlier this year. “Since the handover in 1997 we have not made good progress on confidence-building between Hong Kong and the mainland,” Mr. Wang said. He likened the central government in Beijing to a mother, who would never do anything to harm her children. “The mother always acts in the best interests of her children,” he said. “Her intentions are pure.” In an unusual theoretical leap for a state that is still at least nominally socialist, Mr. Wang suggested one reason to keep control of the nomination process was to protect the interests of its capitalist class. “We have to take care of every class,” he said. “Every group of people. Every person. Rich or poor. No one should be ignored. No one should be left behind. Especially those whose slice of pie will be shared by others upon the implementation of universal suffrage.”
world/asia,Many of Hong Kong’s tycoons — at the top of the hierarchy in a city that has for decades been ranked as one of the most free-market economies in the world — have long feared that democracy would lead to the introduction of a European-style welfare state, with much higher taxes on their fortunes to pay for it. Since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, a committee of about 1,200 electors who choose the top leader has been stacked with tycoons, and the first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, was drawn from their ranks. Mr. Wang drew on a theoretical shift made more than a decade ago that allowed capitalists into the Communist Party. The so-called “Three Represents” policy formally ended decades of official hostility toward the business class in a state founded to promote the interests of workers and peasants. But on Thursday, Mr. Wang appeared to take that one step further, putting the interests of the wealthy above others’ by advocating that they retain power in Hong Kong disproportionate to their numbers. “Even if it is a small group of people, a very small group of people,” Mr. Wang said. “But they control the destiny of the economy in Hong Kong. If we just ignore their interests, then Hong Kong capitalism will stop. So that’s why on the one hand we realize universal suffrage in Hong Kong, on the other hand we must guarantee the continued development of capitalism in Hong Kong.”
world/asia,Martin Lee, founder of the Democratic Party, who helped to write the laws that will govern Hong Kong separately from the rest of China until 2047, said the idea that the interests of the rich wouldn’t be protected in a democracy went against the experience of advanced industrialized states. “There’s a Republican Party in the States, there’s a Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. Right? I mean you can just form your own party,” Mr. Lee said in an interview following Mr. Wang’s remarks. “There’s no reason why the law should be bent to protect their interest above the interest of everybody else. We’re talking about equal rights, and they cannot claim to be more equal than the others.”

us/politics,Congress Meets, With 5 Days to Avoid Shutdown Over Funding - The New York Times Congress has until midnight on Friday to pass legislation funding the government as the fiscal year draws to a close. The process could get a little messy. Many Senate Democrats — and some Republicans — have said they intend to oppose a short-term funding bill proposed by Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, setting the stage for a legislative scramble to avoid a government shutdown. Among other things, Democrats are objecting that the legislation provides no money to deal with water contamination in Flint, Mich., located in a state with two Democratic senators, while it includes funds that could go for flood relief in Louisiana, which is represented by two Republicans. A test vote is set for Tuesday, and a rejection of the McConnell plan could make it difficult to find a new compromise in time to avert a shutdown. Mr. McConnell will no doubt do what he can to avoid that situation, since he has made it a priority to evade such government disruptions, particularly with the election just over a month away. Democrats, aware of his predicament, will try to use their leverage to the full extent possible. The fight is something of a surprise since it initially appeared that lawmakers would provide the funding to keep the government open until Dec. 9 with little conflict.
sports/baseball,Matt Harvey Proves Stellar in Shutout as Mets Defeat the Rockies - The New York Times On Tuesday, with about eight weeks remaining in the season, the Mets sent their season-ticket holders directions for buying tickets for potential postseason games at Citi Field. As part of the package, the Mets were selling hypothetical seats to the World Series — and it was not a cruel joke. Whether the Mets realize their potential, though, and reach the playoffs for the first time since 2006 seems to depend largely on their young starting pitchers: how they perform and whether the Mets can keep them healthy while managing their innings limits. On Tuesday night, for example, Matt Harvey pitched as well as he has all year, blanking the Colorado Rockies for eight innings. But the Mets led by only 1-0 in the eighth, when Manager Terry Collins pulled him for a pinch-hitter. Harvey put up a brief fight. He told Collins he could go one more inning. He had thrown 97 pitches. “But that’s one less inning we have in September,” Collins told him. The Mets tacked on three runs that inning to finish off what ended as a 4-0 win. They would be wise to do all they can to keep Harvey pitching. Although his first year back after Tommy John surgery has not always been this smooth, lately he has seemed to find his rhythm more easily. He still has the occasional nine-strikeout game, but he has made an effort to pitch deeper into games, pounding the strike zone with his fastball and creating easy outs while conserving his energy and still, at times, baffling hitters.
sports/baseball,Harvey has not issued a walk in his last three starts. He has pitched at least seven innings in each of his last six starts, the longest such streak of his career. In that time, he has compiled a 1.44 E.R.A. and 35 strikeouts. On Tuesday, Harvey even extended his scoreless streak to 15 innings. He allowed only four base runners all night, three of them on infield singles. He certainly had a legitimate case to stay in the game. But he understood Collins’s reasoning. “It is what it is,” Harvey said, “in order to get me into October.” After the game, Collins indicated that Harvey was fast approaching his innings limit. That is why the Mets will probably use a spot starter or two this month and are awaiting Steven Matz’s return in September so they can use a six-man rotation. “I’ll tell you this,” Collins said. “We are going to do everything in our power to keep from shutting this guy down. Any of those guys down.” INSIDE PITCH After the game, the Mets sent Kevin Plawecki to Class AAA Las Vegas and recalled Anthony Recker. ... In the second game of his rehabilitation stint, David Wright played third base for six innings for the Mets’ Class A team in Port St. Lucie, Fla. He fielded two bunts and one slow-rolling grounder, and went 1 for 3 with a single and a strikeout.

arts/music,How the Dixie Chicks Hit the Charts Without Radio Support - The New York Times In February, eager programmers at the nation's top country music stations got their first chance to hear new music from the Dixie Chicks in four years. But in a suite at the annual Country Radio Seminar in Nashville, brows soon furrowed over what would be the band's first single, the angry "Not Ready to Make Nice," which jabs at fans and programmers who ostracized the trio after its lead singer, Natalie Maines, disparaged President Bush in 2003, just before the start of the Iraq war. "It took our breath away," Julie Stevens, program director of KRTY-FM, a country station in San Jose, Calif., said of the song. Before hearing it, she said, she had figured "fans would forgive and forget as long as she shut up about it." Now, she said, "that's not going to happen." But surprise: even though the Dixie Chicks' new album, "Taking the Long Way," has been shunned by country and other mainstream stations, it has spent its first two weeks at the top of the Billboard chart. That is one of the best starts ever for a country album receiving scant airplay. Has it broken the mold? For now, at least. The fast start can be explained largely by a huge promotional push that put the trio on the cover of Time magazine and on "60 Minutes," "Larry King Live" and "Good Morning America," and that included an exclusive deal with the Target retail chain, which offered fans who bought the album early access to concert tickets, along with exposure on Web sites like Amazon and MSN, which is run by Microsoft.
arts/music,But staying power is another matter. With the promotional rollout over and the group still seen in country radio circles as polarizing, it is doubtful, even with their early momentum, that the Dixie Chicks will get much airplay, industry experts say. And that could hurt the record's chances to sustain its solid early sales. "The question becomes, without radio airplay, will they see any spikes, or will it just be a slow, steady downward spiral?" said Lon Helton, the Nashville bureau chief for Radio & Records magazine. Another troubling sign is uneven ticket sales for the band's coming national concert tour, which has prompted organizers to halt sales in markets like Indianapolis and Oklahoma City ahead of a likely reshuffling of tour dates. Still, there is a precedent for an album to be ignored by country radio and still be a hit with fans: the rootsy soundtrack to "O Brother, Where Art Thou?," released in 2000, sold millions of copies and won the Grammy for album of the year. The Dixie Chicks' CD opened at No. 1 on Billboard's national album chart last week with sales of 526,000 copies. That was the third-biggest opening of the year, but far behind the trio's last album, "Home," which sold 780,000 copies the week it was released in  2002, according to Nielsen SoundScan data. The album held on to the top spot this week despite a not-uncommon 48 percent drop, and could log a third consecutive week at No. 1 if it outsells a new CD from the rock band AFI.
arts/music,The initial publicity campaign orchestrated by the group's label, Columbia Records, took into account its diminished stature among country programmers. Columbia's chairman, Steve Barnett, said: "We knew going into this campaign that radio was not going to embrace the girls. We were aggressive in our strategy to reach the masses and felt that we were successful." The effort appears to have attracted many who had not paid much mind to the Dixie Chicks before. The album rang up solid sales from more unconventional outlets, including Starbucks shops and Apple's iTunes music service.  Underneath that was strong turnout from the trio's hard-core fans, retailers said. "For the most part, it was their core fan base that came out," said Bryan Everitt, director of music operations for the 153-store Hastings Entertainment chain, based in Amarillo, Tex. Mr. Everitt said "Taking the Long Way" was the company's top seller for the last two weeks, even though many of its stores are "right here in George W. Bush country." Given Ms. Maines's remark at a concert in London in 2003 — "Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas," the band's home state — red-state markets might be the last place to expect brisk sales. But whatever the band's appeal at the cash register, its identity has been clouded by far more than politics.
arts/music,From early in their career, the Dixie Chicks' flair for independence — even impetuousness — has made for uneasy relations with the Nashville establishment. Nonetheless, the band became one of the most commercially successful recording and performing acts in history, racking up sales to date of more than 24 million copies. The Dixie Chicks' 2003 tour generated box-office sales of $60.5 million, up to that year an all-time high for a country tour. After Ms. Maines's anti-Bush remark, songs from the album "Home" virtually disappeared from American airwaves within days, and their No. 1 country single, "Travelin' Soldier," soon plummeted to No. 63. In appearances tied to the new CD, the band has taken pains to stand apart from the country genre — and, critics say, the mainstream country audience. "Taking the Long Way" leans more toward somber, 1970's-style country-rock than the airy power-country style that drove the band's earlier hits. As Ms. Maguire told Time, the band would rather attract fans "who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith." She added, "We don't want those kinds of fans." That kind of sentiment has undermined the Dixie Chicks' prospects even at radio stations that had not abandoned it before. Ms. Stevens, the San Jose radio programmer, said she had played the band's music even when many other country programmers had taken it off the air in 2003. But now, she said, the band's choice of songs seemed aimed at renewing old tensions.
arts/music,"If they don't care, how in the world am I going to care?" Ms. Stevens asked. "I'm tired of fighting their fight."

world/europe,‘That Ignoramus’: 2 French Scholars of Radical Islam Turn Bitter Rivals - The New York Times PARIS — What propels Islamist terrorism and attacks against France is more than an academic debate: The answer shapes policy toward blunting the threat. So it is no inconsequential matter in a culture under attack, and one that so cherishes its intellectual debates, that France’s two leading scholars of radical Islam — former friends — have turned bitter rivals over their differing views. “Madman,” “thug,” “illiterate,” “paranoid,” “ass,” “not a thinker” — these are just some of the choicer insults the two men have hurled at each other in a peculiarly personal quarrel with far larger stakes that has reverberated through the French news media and society for months. The two distinguished academics, Olivier Roy and Gilles Kepel, have long lists of books to their name, and years of field work in the Middle East, Central Asia and the troubled French suburbs. They are both eagerly consulted by the French news media and government officials. But with France on edge and the continued target of terrorist attacks, their clashing analyses of the origins, development and future of jihadism have broken out of academic circles to present an important question for France and for all of Europe: Which man holds the key to understanding the phenomenon? Mr. Kepel, 61, a professor at Sciences Po, the prestigious political science institute, finds much of the answer inside France — in its suburbs and their dysfunctional sociology — and in the role of Islam, angering many on the left.
world/europe,Mr. Roy, 66, who as a bearded young man roamed Afghanistan with the mujahedeen in the 1980s and now teaches at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, places greater emphasis on individual behavior and psychology in a jihadism he considers strictly marginal to Islam. Mr. Kepel sees individuals as cogs in a system — part of a classically French, structuralist tradition that minimizes the role of individual human agency. Mr. Roy, on the other hand, sees mostly troubled people in the jihadist ranks who act out their fantasies of violence and cruelty. The terrorists who have carried out recent attacks were mostly marginalized young men and petty criminals, he says, adding that they have used Islam as a cover to pursue extreme violence. “They haven’t had a militant past,” Mr. Roy said of many of these terrorists, in a telephone interview. The problem they represent, he says, is the “Islamicization of radicalism.” It is a signature phrase that enrages Mr. Kepel, who leans toward its opposite: the radicalization of Islam. “That ignoramus,” Mr. Kepel grumbled in an interview this month in his book-lined office, offering some choice gibes about his onetime friend’s lack of Arabic. Mr. Kepel testified for an influential 2015 parliamentary report, wrote a best seller on terrorism after the attacks in Paris in November, and has been omnipresent in television and radio studios. “At the ministry, they tell me, ‘I saw Kepel yesterday,’ ” said Mr. Roy, himself a favorite of the country’s dominant left-leaning news media. His arguments, for the moment at least, appear to be winning in government circles.
world/europe,As the jockeying has intensified in official circles, so has the falling-out between the old friends. Today they cannot stand each other, and, with the passion that typifies intellectual fights in a country where nothing short of war is more serious, they contemptuously dismiss each other’s views. “The King Is Naked,” read the headline on Mr. Kepel’s attack on Mr. Roy this spring in the newspaper Libération, in a play on the French meaning of Mr. Roy’s name. In turn, while acknowledging a long and now broken friendship, Mr. Roy today offers his own less-than-friendly critique of Mr. Kepel as a kind of cloistered intellectual. “We were friends for 20 years,” Mr. Roy said in the interview. “I traveled with him in Istanbul. But I was very struck by his incapacity to talk to anybody.” “He’s sincere the way a madman is,” he added. “He’s not a thinker. He’s not a philosopher.” The French debate has echoes of Republican criticism in the United States of President Obama for his reluctance to use the word Islam in connection with terrorism. But as is so often the case in contemporary France, the heart of the dispute here is a disagreement about the country’s relationship with Islam. Mr. Roy sees a Muslim population that is relatively well integrated. But for Mr. Kepel, the murderous jihadism that struck France in 2015 is the expression of a slow-burning Islamist radicalization that took shape over decades because of a failure of integration.
world/europe,The year 2005 is the dividing line for Mr. Kepel. After riots in the Paris suburbs that year, Muslim youths felt a “need to dissociate from France, and leave it,” he wrote in his book “Terreur dans l’Hexagone,” which appeared soon after the Paris attacks in November and sold tens of thousands of copies to a public hungry for explanation. Mr. Kepel calls this the third generation of Islam in France, after a first generation of immigration and a second of unsatisfied political restiveness. In 2005, Mr. Kepel said, a text appeared online that founded what he calls the third generation of jihadism abroad. This 1,600-page text — “Appeal to Global Islamic Resistance,” by a Syrian-born engineer, Abu Musab al-Suri — calls for “civil war in Europe” fomented by “unintegrated” Muslim youth. For Mr. Kepel, this was the playbook for the atrocities of the Islamic State jihadists that have bedeviled France. “If you want to comprehend their functioning, you have got to understand their background,” Mr. Kepel said. “You have got to understand the intellectual resources of Salafism,” he added, referring to the ultraconservative, sometimes militant movement in Islam. But Mr. Roy scoffs at what he sees as his rival’s near-obsessive reliance on the text by Mr. Suri, a onetime functionary of Al Qaeda who broke with Osama bin Laden. “Nobody is interested in al-Suri,” Mr. Roy said. “It’s absurd.” When Mr. Kepel “talks of a ‘third generation in 2005,’ that’s false,” Mr. Roy said. “It’s exactly the same profile as in the second generation — petty delinquency.”
world/europe,“There is no proof that shows the young men go from Salafism to terrorism,” Mr. Roy said, pointing out that the planner of the Paris attacks in November, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, ate McDonald’s, which is not halal. “None of the terrorists were Salafists.” “They are on the margins,” Mr. Roy said of the recent wave of terrorists. “They have trajectories that are profoundly individual.” French commentators have avoided picking sides in this fight, though Mr. Kepel’s more coldblooded approach has generally found less sympathy. “The Islamicization of radicalism — this is more of an intuition — but it is a humanist intention,” Leyla Dakhli, a researcher at the C.N.R.S. research institute, said in an interview. “It is a hypothesis that has the merit of not isolating the Muslim world,” said Ms. Dakhli, who analyzed the quarrel recently in the magazine Revue du Crieur. Others find the two points of view not necessarily mutually exclusive. But there is little chance that the two men will reconcile and write a book together, in the great French tradition. “He insulted me,” Mr. Roy said. “It’s unacceptable. He’s been insulting me for six months, at all the conferences. He’s been waging a personal campaign. It’s totally unacceptable.”
style,When Your Uber Driver Brings a Time Machine - The New York Times The name next to the tiny photo of my Uber driver looked familiar, and so did the face. If it was him, I was in for one awkward (or interesting) ride with the ex-husband of the woman now married to my ex-husband. Wrapping up a business trip, I was standing outside a hotel in Silicon Valley. My meeting had ended sooner than expected so I was headed to the airport to try to catch an earlier flight to New York. Since I wasn’t in a rush, I had chosen the shared ride feature. I had two minutes to decide whether to cancel, as the car icon was closing in. I kept the reservation. I knew it was him. What are we to each other, two people whose ex-spouses are now married? The word must exist in some language, maybe French or Italian. Twelve years ago our marriages ended, and several months later our exes moved in together. His wife had been my husband’s assistant, then associate. Their work involved investing in start-up companies in Latin America, so they traveled often, and we spouses often tagged along. Back in the New York City area, we regularly had dinner at each other’s houses. I knew their children. Over time, they moved to the Connecticut town where my husband and I had a weekend house, which meant we saw them even more. I didn’t think much of it, though friends told me they thought it was creepy.
style,The divorce shattered me. My husband and I had met near the end of college and shared a huge circle of friends. I was attracted to his fancy suburban background, a step up from my scrappier family where I was the first to graduate from college. We lived in Hong Kong, saw Angkor Wat and Easter Island. At first, our opposite natures felt complementary — my curiosity, his need for the familiar. The biggest difference, or so we thought, was that I wanted children and he didn’t. And if we weren’t going to have them, I wanted more of everything else: spontaneity and adventure. Yet he was ready to settle down. In suburbia, no less. We started unraveling. If we’d had children, we would have had a reason to fight for the marriage. At the time, I said the child issue was our undoing, but we knew it was more than that. We couldn’t make it past 10 years, when initial attraction often starts sliding into other kinds of marital love. And we both had turned to others for emotional support. Time really is the only thing that heals a wound like divorce. I can’t remember when I stopped thinking about my ex every day, but I realized — as my Uber driver wound his way through traffic toward me — that it had been ages since that whole mess had ruled my life. I can conjure up my ex’s face but not his smell or his voice. I don’t recall what it felt like to wake up next to his body.
style,Over the past 12 years, I had barely thought of the guy whose face was now on my phone. He had emailed me after we each separated, looking for commiseration or help in his divorce case. I was too consumed by my own pain to reply. When his car pulled up, I saw a big, familiar smile through the windshield. He sprang out and said, “I had a feeling it was you!” After a long embrace, we got into the car, with me in the passenger seat instead of the back. It was oddly comfortable sitting next to him. He canceled the ride share passenger and we went to a cafe, where we sat for nearly two hours, chattering. We whipped out our phones to share photos. Weddings. Homes. Trips. A new wife and gaggle of stepchildren for him. A new husband and French bulldog for me. Full, happy lives. Or at least that’s what the photos suggested. It made me wonder what photos from our previous marriages would have suggested about those lives. Did we feel as contented then as we both appeared to feel now? Would others have been able to see something shattering behind the smiles? And that’s when we turned to a subject that once cut deeply for us both, though I can’t remember who asked first: Had our exes been physically involved before our splits? He didn’t know, and neither did I, though we didn’t think they had, at least not “technically.”
style,Most startling, though, was how it no longer mattered — to either of us. That once-scalding question had lost its potency. But it took seeing him and talking about it to make me realize that. We quickly moved on. He knew my mother and best friend and wanted updates. I was thrilled to hear that his children were now promising young adults, details I could have gotten through my ex had I ever thought to ask in the occasional emails we trade. Boys who would remember me as their stepfather’s ex-wife. “He’s been a standup guy as a stepfather,” my Uber driver said. I assumed he was, even though it caused me terrible pain that he hadn’t wanted children in our marriage. “They were meant for each other,” we said nearly in unison, before rattling off the quirks that made them compatible and agreeing that we are all better off in our new couplings. I have been with my new love for 12 years, almost exactly as long as I had been with my ex. Two years ago we traveled to Italy. As we packed, I couldn’t help remembering another trip to Italy in my previous life, a trip for a 10th anniversary that marked the beginning of the end. On our first night in Positano, I lost my footing on the cobblestone streets and knew I had broken something.
style,A local doctor confirmed it and gave me a shot of something alcoholic. The next day we flew home, cutting our trip short. The marriage never felt the same. That foot never felt the same either. Until recently, when I noticed my toes don’t feel numb anymore. When I met the man who is now my husband, I was 39 and he was 46; our window for having children was nearly closed. I knew he didn’t want them, yet I couldn’t pull away. I started to admit that maybe there was a reason I chose men who were skittish about fatherhood. It was easy to assign the decision to someone else. I still mourn that loss, but increasingly I’m at peace with it. Rather than going deep into a few key relationships, I have an ever-expanding collection of people in my life — extended family, younger friends, mentors of all ages. I have gratifying work, volunteering and time to read, travel, learn. None of this came out in the wave of photos, but looking at them made me see it. My Uber driver, whose tie to me still yearns for a name — perhaps my ex-once-removed? — wanted to make sure I didn’t miss my flight. So we returned to the car and headed to the airport, where we hugged again and promised to keep in touch.
style,I immediately called my husband. We rarely talk when I travel, preferring to text and email. I come home to flowers and some little surprise near the mail. If I have taken a red-eye, I jump into bed with the man and pooch I have gotten a real chance to miss. This time I couldn’t hold it in. “You’ll never believe who my Uber driver was!” I said. And then I spilled the whole story. We were on so long, I nearly missed my flight. My husband was rapt, wanting every detail, even though he would see me in a few hours. And I was glad because, for years, he hadn’t wanted to hear about my first marriage, studiously avoiding the subject. But this had changed for him too, now that it was so far away. “That could have been a scene in a movie,” he said. In the movie version, though, I would have had a fling with the ex-once-removed. In real life, I got closure from the most unexpected source. I realized that connections at a distance, along with the passage of time, can offer telling reflections and a reminder that marriages can unravel in an instant. How could I ensure this new life wouldn’t break apart the way my last one had? Months later, to protest Uber’s business practices, I deleted the app, but with a twinge of regret. In a strange way, Uber had helped me sort out my feelings about the most significant men in my life and moved my current relationship into a more honest place. Who knew there was an app for that?
world/australia,In Australian Election, Discontent Is the Front-Runner - The New York Times SYDNEY, Australia — Australia has burned through six prime ministers in the last nine years, a pattern that its current leader, Malcolm Turnbull, hoped to break by dissolving Parliament and calling an election for this weekend. But his plan to win a stronger mandate has collided with forces not unlike the anger that prompted Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and has fueled populist movements on the Continent and in the United States. Australian voters hold the leaders of both establishment parties in disdain, with polls showing Mr. Turnbull, leader of the right-wing Liberal Party, and Bill Shorten, leader of the opposition Labor Party, heading into the election on Saturday with historically low support. Mr. Turnbull’s support has tumbled. In June, it was 48 percent, down from a high of 69 percent soon after he took office 10 months ago, a Fairfax Ipsos poll shows. Mr. Shorten’s approval rating is even worse, at 34 percent, but is better than the 18 percent he had in November. Discontent appears to be driving voters to the fringes, with smaller parties gaining support at the expense of the two major parties. But Australia’s anti-establishment mood, unlike the one buoyed by nationalist and anti-immigration sentiments that has upended politics in the United States and Europe, is diffuse, and its beneficiaries span the political map. The liberal Greens party, which has 10 senators and one lawmaker in the lower house, expects to win more seats.
world/australia,There has been a groundswell of support for a new party led by Senator Nick Xenophon from South Australia, who was first elected to state office in 1997 on a single issue, banning poker machines — still a major concern for his party. On the far right, Pauline Hanson’s anti-immigrant One Nation party looks likely to win a seat in Queensland. “The one thing I have been fighting about is Muslim takeover,” she said in a campaign video. “It is not good for us as Australians.” Another minor party, the Liberal Democrats, is fielding 47 candidates who believe in more guns and less government. “There is a tendency, worldwide, for a plague on both their houses, or all their houses, and a tendency to look for an alternative, looking for somebody else,” the Liberal Democrats’ one member of Parliament, David Leyonhjelm, told ABC Radio National on Tuesday. Senator Bob Day of the Family First party, speaking on the same program, said, “There is no doubt the electorate has lost faith in basically the political classes’ ability to address the nation’s and the world’s problems, like we have seen in Europe.” Family First is a conservative party rooted in Christian evangelical movements. The smaller parties are predicted to gain seats, but their platforms are so diverse that the major parties cannot easily absorb them. And the major parties have little hope of winning over voters whose support for a minor party stems from their dissatisfaction with mainstream politicians.
world/australia,At the same time, the major parties are losing a grip on their core constituencies. “In the past, voters could identify with elements of a party’s policies based around their own education, wealth, occupation, even where they live,” said Rodney Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Sydney. “But people now have a whole range of identities that are important to them. It is a very tricky time to try to win seats if you are part of a major party.” These trends have left the major-party candidates flailing and, as the vote nears, resorting to more desperate attacks. Mr. Turnbull recently accused the Labor Party of lacking “the willpower” to turn back boats of asylum seekers. “Imagine the chaos,” he warned, if Labor were elected. Mr. Shorten accused the Turnbull government of having secret plans to privatize Australia’s universal health care. A vote for the conservatives, he said, will send Australia “down the path of an Americanized health care system, where how much you earn will determine the quality of your health care.” However, Mr. Shorten’s Labor Party has the same policy on turning back migrant boats as the current government. And Mr. Turnbull has vowed he will never privatize health care, although some of his party’s policies appear to be chipping away at the edges. The parties do have real differences, on climate change for instance. Mr. Shorten has promised significantly stricter limits on carbon emissions than Mr. Turnbull has. He says 50 percent of Australia’s electricity will come from renewable energy sources by 2030, compared with Mr. Turnbull’s 23 percent by 2020.
world/australia,The candidates have also sparred over same-sex marriage, even though they both support it. Mr. Turnbull says that he favors repealing a ban on same-sex marriage, but that after taking office said he would honor his predecessor’s plan to hold a plebiscite on the issue, a vote critics say would quickly descend into a divisive campaign of hatred and gay-bashing. Mr. Shorten, who once favored a plebiscite, wants Parliament to vote on the issue, which he says has wide support among Australians. While both men have changed positions, Mr. Turnbull’s shift is seen as an example of how he has been hobbled by his party’s right wing, eroding hopes that he would be a bold leader. That disappointment, along with some flat-footed campaigning, was a major factor in his tumble in the polls. Polls, not elections, killed off the last three prime ministers. The last, the gaffe-prone Tony Abbott, did not survive his first term; Mr. Turnbull challenged him and the party threw him out. Mr. Turnbull’s gamble on a new election now looks dicey. Analysts say he is likely to win, but with a reduced majority in the lower house and a fractured Senate. A slim margin could be fatal for his leadership. “Mr. Turnbull’s performance during the campaign really puts his leadership on the line,” said Peter Chen, a political analyst at Sydney University. It does not help that the campaign has been unusually long by Australian standards. Australia’s election campaigns typically run about four weeks. This one, announced May 8, will last eight.
world/australia,Voters are tired of the campaign, Professor Smith said, and both party leaders are finding it difficult to sustain.
opinion,Opinion | Saudi Arabia’s Ominous Reach Into Yemen - The New York Times
upshot,Why Even Some Republicans Are Rejecting the Replacement Bill - The New York Times Republicans in Congress are fond of calling Obamacare a death spiral of escalating costs and declining coverage. But their replacement plan could make those problems even worse. Tuesday, the morning after two House committees released legislation that would replace the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care Act, the plan received a tepid, even hostile reaction from many outside conservative groups and Republicans in Congress. The bill does less than many conservatives had hoped to open up the market for health insurance. And it still offers the kind of subsidies to middle-income people that they see as too generous. Mike Lee, a conservative senator from Utah, described the bill as “not the Obamacare repeal bill we’ve been waiting for.” (It perhaps goes without saying that it has been universally panned by Democrats.) And here’s why. Republicans are constrained by their small majority in the Senate. Instead of passing a normal piece of legislation that could change the Affordable Care Act’s many insurance regulations, they are limited to changes that can be accomplished through a technical budgetary maneuver, a reconciliation bill. The result is likely to be higher prices for insurance, and fewer people with the ability to buy it. "The individual market seems less stable under this bill than under the Affordable Care Act,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. “This bill comes across as a bit of a Frankenstein health bill because of the legislative strategy that’s being used.”
upshot,Many conservative legislators would prefer a reprise of a 2015 bill that would have simply swept away much of Obamacare. But the current bill’s drafters have felt political pressure from President Trump and their constituents to preserve some of the health law’s coverage gains. Their efforts to preserve popular parts of the law and work within the special budget rules have led to the uneasy mix of policies in the bill. The bill keeps many of the Affordable Care Act’s rules for insurance companies that Republicans have decried for raising costs. Here’s what stays. ■ The health law’s rule that insurance companies must sell polices to the healthy and the sick at the same price. ■ Its rule that insurance companies can’t limit the benefits they pay out in a year or a lifetime. ■ Its requirements that all plans cover 10 categories of benefits, including preventive health services without a co-payment, rehabilitation services and maternity care. ■ The law’s caps on how much customers can be asked to pay for health care through deductibles and co-payments. Those are popular provisions; they tend to make insurance coverage comprehensive but also somewhat costly. (The main reason that health insurance plans are expensive, of course, is because medical care is expensive, and the bill doesn’t do anything about that either.) Because they all stay, the rest of the policy changes are built atop a chassis of health insurance products that cost what today’s plans cost.
upshot,The bill effectively slashes subsidies that help many low-income people buy insurance, starting in 2020. A 60-year-old earning $20,000 in Lincoln, Neb., currently gets a subsidy of $18,470 to help her buy insurance, with extra subsidies to help her pay deductibles and co-payments, according to calculations made by Kaiser. Under the new legislation, she would get a subsidy of $4,000, and no help with cost sharing. The bill also does away with Obamacare’s requirement that people have insurance or pay a fine. That provision is unpopular, but it is seen as an important incentive for healthy people to buy insurance every year. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating that provision would lead to premiums that are 20 to 25 percent higher, even without any cuts in subsidies. As a counterweight, the bill does some things that would tend to stabilize prices. It gives states a big pot of money to help keep markets working. It allows insurance companies to charge higher prices to old customers and less to younger ones. That is not so good for our hypothetical 60-year-old in Nebraska, but might help lure some healthy 20-year-olds into the market who don’t buy insurance now. It also creates a new kind of financial incentive to buy insurance: People with a lapse in insurance coverage of more than a couple of months would have to pay a 30 percent higher price for their insurance when they re-enter the market. Advocates say this provision would get people to stay insured when they are healthy so they can afford coverage later. But some critics think it could backfire, since only sick people would be willing to pay the extra fee, which might not be enough to cover the extra cost of their care.
upshot,“The people who are going to take this gamble are going to be the healthiest,” said Craig Garthwaite, the director of the health program at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “The only time you are going to get them into the market is if they get sick.” Insurers have been vague so far on how they feel about this mix of policies. And the Congressional Budget Office, Washington’s official scorekeeper, has not weighed in with estimates of how many people would be covered or what the bill would cost the federal government. But several health policy experts have said they believe the policy changes could result in the loss of health insurance for 10 million Americans or more. Joe Antos, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he sees some good ideas in the health bill, but estimated that it would cost 10 to 15 million people their insurance over the coming decade: “It can’t be a cohesive whole, because the things that can’t be in a reconciliation bill aren’t here.”
us,In Wichita, Koch Influence Is Revered and Reviled - The New York Times WICHITA, Kan. —  In national politics, playing in Charles Koch’s arena can mean saturation advertising against vulnerable Democrats, calls for tax cuts, demands to roll back government regulation and bitter clashes over climate change. Here in the windswept hometown of the Koch family and Koch Industries, playing in Charles Koch Arena means something else entirely. “I would be hard-pressed to find two things that are more important to this community than Koch Industries and Shocker basketball,” said Gregg Marshall, coach of the Wichita State University men’s team, which packs the arena, a house that Mr. Koch restored with his donations. “They put a nice chunk of change into this building.” Welcome to Kochville, where the family name conjures up something decidedly different from the specter raised by Democrats of secretive political operations funded by tens of millions of dollars in anonymous campaign money. For many living here in Wichita along the Arkansas River, it stands instead for well-paying jobs, extensive philanthropy like the $6 million for the arena renovation, and Kansas pride in being the headquarters of Koch Industries, the nation’s second-largest privately held company, which produces oil, fertilizer and common household items. Outside of Kochville, the brothers Charles and David Koch, whose worth is estimated at more than $50 billion each, are ready villains. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, regularly skewers them on the Senate floor. Others have proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at diluting their influence. The two are even the subject of an updated documentary titled “Koch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition.”
us,But the charged atmosphere surrounding the Kochs elsewhere dissipates markedly in the city where their father, Fred Koch, started his business in 1925, even though the positive sentiment toward the Kochs is hardly universally shared. The Kochs’ reach in the city — once known as Cowtown because of its history as a railhead for Texas cattle drives and later called America’s Air Capital for its private aircraft manufacturing industry — extends far beyond the arena and company headquarters now expanding in the northeast corner of the city. Not far away is the Koch Community Plaza and Koch Scouting Center. Then there is the Koch Orangutan and Chimpanzee Habitat at the robustly Koch-supported Sedgwick County Zoo. Stop off for swimming lessons at the Koch Aquatic Center at the North Branch Y.M.C.A., or a learning experience recognizing the ecological interests of Fred Koch and his wife, Mary, at the Great Plains Nature Center’s Koch Habitat Hall. The Kochs contribute generously to Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Salvation Army and smaller community endeavors. The company’s 3,500 jobs, regular employment opportunities and growth have meant steady paychecks in Wichita while other important and historic sectors of the local economy have struggled. The company estimated its direct payments in salary and benefits to Kansas workers, most of them in Wichita, at $410 million last year. “There is almost no one in town who doesn’t have a friend, a neighbor, a relative who works out at Koch,” said Mary Beth Jarvis, a former Koch executive who oversees the organization that puts on the city’s annual river festival and the accompanying symphony concert, which has long been underwritten by the Koch family.
us,Since 2000, organizations affiliated with the Koch family or company have given more than $50 million to Wichita and Kansas nonprofit groups, according to a company tally. Charles Koch lives in Wichita, and David lives in New York City, where he is also a donor to the arts and medicine. While such strong community support has dazzled some residents, others see the Koch activities as insidious, an attempt to buy good will while the two brothers and their political allies spend much more behind the scenes to dismantle bedrock government programs more important to the average Kansan. “That is all just bells and whistles, the shiny little things to distract you while they are proceeding to try to change our country into what they want it to be,” said Randy Mousley, president of the Wichita teachers’ union. He has clashed with Koch-backed groups and legislators over deep income and business tax cuts that reduced state aid for education and forced some districts to eliminate staff and raise property taxes. “The Kochs are using their money and influence to hold our community hostage,” said Louis Goseland, the campaign director for Kansas People’s Action, a progressive activist group in Wichita that is also battling the Koch political agenda. “Right now we are working under Koch rule.” Koch officials dismiss such ideas as far-fetched. They say Koch contributions to Wichita are a way of repaying a city that has made it possible for both the Koch company and family to thrive because of its entrepreneurial spirit and available work force.
us,“We wouldn’t do it just as protection money or whatever you call it,” said Mark V. Holden, senior vice president and general counsel for Koch Industries. “It is not just about the business doing well. We are trying to get involved in issues and in places, particularly in this, our hometown, where we can make a difference.” Amplifying the company’s influence, many former executives such as Ms. Jarvis, schooled in the Koch way, move on from the company to play leadership roles at other organizations in and around Wichita. Koch officials, present and former, sit on boards throughout the community. “I don’t think there has been a time since ’95 that we have not had somebody from Koch Industries at an upper level on our board,” said Mark C. Reed, director of the zoo, who noted that it recently hosted the company’s annual picnic for 4,000 employees and their families. The philanthropic hand of the family was not always so visible as the Kochs used to shy away from recognition and kept their giving more low key. But escalating negative attention from a series of court fights and their rising conservative activism have spurred a more public role over the years, though Charles Koch only reluctantly let his name be affixed to the arena, officials said. The company last week began a national advertising campaign around the theme “We Are Koch,” emphasizing that Koch Industries was “started in the heartland” and had ample job opportunities.
us,The expansive local footprint of the company has left Koch critics to tread lightly. Mr. Mousley said he avoided the subject of the Kochs during family gatherings since his brother and sister-in-law work for Koch Industries. Some Wichita business owners and officials said they were reluctant to discuss the company’s local reach for fear of losing business or good relations with neighbors. Even Kansas People’s Action chose to participate in a protest outside the Koch office in Washington rather than Wichita, where the company expansion and relocation of a major road (paid for entirely by the company) have pushed the public perimeter away from the office tower. Mr. Holden said the addition should enhance security around the headquarters after threats against the Kochs and their business. The company would not disclose the cost of the addition, intended to accommodate 745 employees, but the entire project is believed to have a price tag in excess of $100 million. Mr. Holden said strong emotions had been stirred against the family since it escalated its political activities, citing the 2010 midterm elections as a turning point. “I attribute a lot of that venom and invective and all that to the national political theater in which we’re living now,” said Mr. Holden, who added that Democrats, led by Mr. Reid, had seized on the Kochs as a convenient foil and fund-raising tool. “They don’t have a bogyman like they do when there is a Republican presidential candidate, and so they have decided we are going to play that role.”
us,As for those living in Wichita, the Koch dominance distresses some. “My daughter, who just graduated from W.S.U., was telling me: ‘Mom, what’s here? The biggest thing you can aspire to do is work for the Koch brothers, and I don’t want to do that,’ ” said Sulma Arias, the executive director of Kansas People’s Action. Others cannot reconcile the image of the Kochs as a sinister political force with their impression of Charles Koch as a regular guy who shows up at Shocker games with his family and meets once a year with Mr. Marshall, the coach, for a “state of the program” discussion. “You see the name of our arena, so that sort of sums things up real quick,” said Ron Baker, a Kansas native and star guard for the Shockers. “I’ve never met the guy, but I heard good things of him.”
us,Trump Hotels’ Tweet Draws Backlash After Immigration Order - The New York Times Amid the uproar against President Trump’s executive order on refugees and immigrants over the weekend, one of his companies, Trump Hotels, learned a valuable social media lesson: All’s fair in political warfare, including old tweets. (Just ask Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.) On Saturday afternoon, as protests grew at airports and courthouses, a 2011 Twitter post from the president’s hospitality business caught fire with social media users who latched onto its once-innocuous inquiry, responding with stories of hardships that their refugee ancestors experienced to get to America. Others just made jokes. That’s what Trump Hotels tweeted in October of that year, adding “We’d love to hear it!” Perhaps not, however, under these circumstances. Nell Scovell, the creator of “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” provided an early model of the typical response to her 17,000 followers. Hundreds of refugee stories, which people said were lore, followed, with many users invoking the Holocaust or other political violence that they said brought their ancestors to the United States. Others took a more firsthand approach, describing their own relevant travels, while many people highlighted the protests that had swamped airports (and some Trump hotels) on Saturday and Sunday, as well as the earlier Women’s March this month. Below are a sampling of the responses. Of course, Trump Hotels is not the first brand or public figure to face an unanticipated barrage on social media. The New York Police Department (#myNYPD), McDonald’s (#McDStories) and former President Barack Obama (#ObamacareIsWorking) have all had seemingly anodyne messages commandeered by the Twitter masses for other purposes.
us,More recently, Mr. Spicer, President Trump’s press secretary, had some of his old opinions — on everything from Dippin’ Dots to Daft Punk — resurfaced as his public profile grew. (He was not a fan of the spherical ice cream.) As of Monday morning, the original Trump Hotels tweet had not been deleted, and the responses continued. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
world/asia,Daughter of Key Figure in South Korean Scandal Is Detained in Denmark - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea — One of the most-wanted figures in the influence-peddling scandal that led to President Park Geun-hye’s parliamentary impeachment last month has been detained by the Danish police, South Korean officials said on Monday. The suspect, Chung Yoo-ra — the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, the longtime confidante of Ms. Park who is at the center of the scandal — has been living in hiding in Europe, ignoring repeated calls from South Korean investigators to return home to face criminal charges. Her mother, Ms. Choi, has been indicted on charges of using her influence with Ms. Park to extort tens of millions of dollars from big businesses. Ms. Park herself has been identified as a criminal accomplice in Ms. Choi’s alleged extortion racket and is now on trial at the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether she should be formally removed from office. But Ms. Chung, 20, has been elusive. Last month, a special prosecutor asked the authorities in Germany, where Ms. Chung, a former member of South Korea’s national equestrian team, had been training, to detain and extradite her. South Korean officials had also asked Interpol to look for her and threatened to invalidate her passport. Ms. Chung was holed up with her infant son, a nanny and two male guardians in a house in the northern Danish city of Aalborg when the local authorities found her on Sunday night, said the South Korean news channel JTBC, which was at the scene when she was apprehended. It said its reporters first alerted the authorities to her whereabouts.
world/asia,“We will request her emergency extradition, working with the special prosecutor’s office,” Lee Chul-sung, the chief of the National Police Agency, said at a news conference in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday. The Danish police said on Monday that they had arrested Ms. Chung after receiving a tip from a South Korean journalist Sunday afternoon and confirmation from the international law enforcement agency Interpol that an international warrant for her arrest had been registered last Tuesday. Ms. Chung confirmed that she was aware that the South Korean authorities wanted to question her, the police said, and added that she was in Denmark for horse racing. The police said that Ms. Chung had not been charged with a crime in Denmark, although prosecutors said they had asked the court to keep Ms. Chung in custody while the question of possible extradition was clarified. South Korea and Denmark have an extradition treaty. Ms. Chung was accused of illegally enrolling in Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 2015, using her mother’s political connections to force the elite school to accept her despite poor qualifications. An inquiry by the Education Ministry revealed that the school had admitted her at the expense of other candidates with better credentials. Her enrollment was revoked in November. The special prosecutor is also looking into accusations that Ms. Choi used millions of dollars from Samsung, South Korea’s largest conglomerate, to finance her daughter’s equestrian career and a luxurious lifestyle in Germany.
world/asia,Ms. Chung has become a lightning rod for public anger as lurid accusations have emerged about her lifestyle. The accusations of illegal enrollment against her have been particularly inflammatory in South Korea, where students cram for years to prepare for intensely competitive college entrance exams. Ewha students were the first to take to the streets to protest the Choi family’s reported influence peddling. After Ms. Chung lost a gold medal to a rival in a domestic equestrian competition in 2013, her family was accused of using its connections to open a government audit of the local equestrian association. Two officials at the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism who looked into the scandal lost their jobs for not siding with Ms. Chung’s family, a former culture minister said. Ms. Park called the officials “bad men,” according to the former minister, Yoo Jin-ryong. Ms. Chung’s family also used its influence to get Ewha to give her good grades even though she hardly attended classes, Education Ministry officials said. On Tuesday, the special prosecutor asked a court to issue an arrest warrant for an Ewha professor who was accused of ordering his teaching assistants to complete assignments for Ms. Chung. “You’ve got nothing but your parents to blame for your lack of resources,” Ms. Chung wrote in a Facebook post in 2014. The post was shared widely in South Korea, where widening economic inequality has fueled increasing public anger.

giving,AFTERMATHS; An Outpouring for Other Victims, the Four-Legged Kind - The New York Times WHILE the outpouring of donations for the human victims of Hurricane Katrina was overwhelming, even more remarkable were the tens of millions raised to help their pets. The Humane Society of the United States received the largest amount, more than $20 million, said Wayne Pacelle, the society's president and chief executive. "It was off the charts," he said. Other animal welfare groups also generated large sums. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took in $13 million, and the American Humane Association received $1.6 million, although neither group's main mission is disaster response. Another group, Noah's Wish, which was founded three years ago to serve that purpose, raised $5 million. Terri Crisp, the founder and director of Noah's Wish, said that the news media's intense focus on animals for the six-week-long duration of the rescue effort was critical in galvanizing sympathetic donors. Typically, she said, animals are stranded for just a few days, far less time to win public attention. "Anytime they would see a dog on a roof, people's hearts went out, and they just wanted to make sure they got help," Ms. Crisp said.
giving,It is estimated that 13,000 to 15,000 animals were cared for by welfare and rescue groups, said Jo Sullivan, the A.S.P.C.A.'s senior vice president for development and communications. Calculating the number of hurricane-related deaths, however, is complicated because the number of strays that lived in the area is unknown. "In New Orleans, they might have bagged them up and disposed of them," said Dr. Terry Conger, an epidemiologist at the Department of Agriculture who helped plan Louisiana's animal rescue effort. "I'm sure the number of pets that expired exceeded the number of human fatalities simply because a lot of people just abandoned their pets, and there's no way to keep track of them." The Humane Society used the money for a range of purposes. It operated two staging areas in Louisiana and Mississippi for animal rescue, admitting 200 to 400 animals a day; arranged for nine 18-wheeler trucks to transport animals and supplies; rented planes to fly animals to shelters outside the region as local ones filled up; sponsored 500 animal-control personnel and individual volunteers to come to the staging areas; provided medical care for the animals; coordinated reunion efforts between pets and owners; ran a disaster-telephone center; and administered grants for local pet rescue and foster care programs. Some of the contributions were spent responding to Hurricanes Rita and Wilma, and the earthquake in Pakistan and India in October. The society also continues to help with shelter reconstruction and is pushing legislation that would include animals in future state and federal disaster plans.
giving,After last year's tsunami, the group received $400,000 from donors. It was, at the time, the most it had ever received in disaster response. After Katrina, a domestic crisis, the society expected an outpouring of $1 million maximum. Getting 20-plus times that, with $18 million pledged over the Internet, was "an entirely different order of magnitude," said Mr. Pacelle of the Humane Society. In addition, 165,000 of its online givers were new. This time around, people could consult the Web sites of animal organizations and get news reports from the field, complete with video and sound, to learn how groups were saving dogs from flooded neighborhoods or reuniting cats with their owners. Spurred to action by what they saw online, donors could give on the spot. "The new donor in the marketplace understands the most effective way to help is to go straight to the Web," said Ms. Sullivan of the A.S.P.C.A. She said that 90 percent of the money they raised after the hurricane came through online donations. The group enlisted thousands of volunteers from its Web site, a process, she said, that "built a community for us, and those people have stayed engaged. They still get our weekly newsletter, and if something like this happens again, we're going to have a group of 18,000 people to draw from to help.
giving,"People who have pets in their home call them their children," Ms. Sullivan added. "The unique part of Katrina is many of these people lost everything -- their homes, their cars, their jobs. The only thing they had left was their pets. The human-animal bond is extremely strong, but in a disaster like Katrina, it's even more important." Marie Belew Wheatley, the president and chief executive of the American Humane Association, agreed. Neglecting animals in crises brings "undue trauma on families that are already traumatized," she said. "That's an important element here, that's an important realization that this disaster has brought to light." Meeting People's Specific Needs IN addition to major relief organizations, many smaller groups are collecting donations to help hurricane victims. Here are a handful. AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF GRAPHIC ARTS -- AIGA, an association of design professionals (aiga.org), estimates that 400 members of its New Orleans chapter were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The group is making grants to members from the region, many of whom have relocated and are trying to establish themselves in new cities. AIGA has also set up a Web site, displaceddesigner.com, where donors can post offers of shelter, office space, computers and other goods to members. HURRICANE KATRINA DISPLACED RESIDENTS FUND -- Half a million people took refuge in Baton Rouge, La., many of whom remain there. The fund (foundationsforrecovery.org) supports individuals as well as agencies offering social and housing services, health care, educational initiatives and job placement.
giving,ARCHITECTURE FOR HUMANITY -- This group (architectureforhumanity.org) is collecting donations to help those working on urban planning and to help shepherd hurricane victims through paperwork for federal and state mortgage and loan programs. NEW ORLEANS MUSICIANS FUND -- The fund (musicmaker.org) is raising money for displaced musicians and for the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic (wwoz.org/clinic), which has provided subsidized medical care to musicians but lost both of its offices. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION -- Hurricane Katrina destroyed more than 25 public libraries and damaged 100. The association (ala.org) is overseeing a hurricane relief fund and an Adopt a Library program. GULF COAST WATERSHED RECOVERY FUND -- The fund (rivernetwork.org) will make grants to groups that need to replace office space, and to support longer-term objectives, like monitoring water quality and advocating for a wetlands restoration effort to help safeguard against future hurricane destruction.

world/middleeast,How the Iranian-Saudi Proxy Struggle Tore Apart the Middle East - The New York Times Behind much of the Middle East’s chaos — the wars in Syria and Yemen, the political upheaval in Iraq and Lebanon and Bahrain — there is another conflict. Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the Middle East into their battlefield. Rather than fighting directly, they wield and in that way worsen the region’s direst problems: dictatorship, militia violence and religious extremism. The history of their rivalry tracks — and helps to explain — the Middle East’s disintegration, particularly the Sunni-Shiite sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate. It is a story in which the United States has been a supporting but constant player, most recently by backing the Saudi war in Yemen, which kills hundreds of civilians. These dynamics, scholars warn, point toward a future of civil wars, divided societies and unstable governments. F. Gregory Gause III, an international relations scholar at Texas A & M University, struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way. Central Africa could be similar, he suggested, referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that, driven by meddling regional powers, killed five million. But in the Middle East, it is just getting started. Saudi Arabia, a young country pieced together only in the 1930s, has built its legitimacy on religion. By promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at Mecca and Medina, it could justify its royal family’s grip on power.
world/middleeast,Iran’s revolution, in 1979, threatened that legitimacy. Iranians toppled their authoritarian government, installing Islamists who claimed to represent “a revolution for the entire Islamic world,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The revolutionaries encouraged all Muslims, especially Saudis, to overthrow their rulers as well. But because Iran is mostly Shiite, they “had the greatest influence with, and tended to reach out to, Shia groups,” Dr. Pollack said. Some Saudi Shiites, who make up about 10 percent of the population, protested in solidarity or even set up offices in Tehran — stoking Saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism. This was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry, which would encompass the whole region. “The Saudis have looked at Iran as a domestic threat from the get-go, from 1979,” Dr. Gause said. Seeing the threat as intolerable, they began looking for a way to strike back. They found that way the next year, when Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Iran, hoping to seize oil-rich territory. Saudi Arabia, Dr. Pollack said, “backed the Iraqis to the hilt because they want the Iranian revolution stopped.” The war, over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks, killed perhaps a million people. It set a pattern of Iranian-Saudi struggle through proxies, and of sucking in the United States, whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals.
world/middleeast,The conflict’s toll exhausted Iran’s zeal for sowing revolution abroad, but gave it a new mission: to overturn the Saudi-led, American-backed regional order that Tehran saw as an existential threat. That sense of insecurity would later drive Iran’s meddling abroad, said Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs. The 1990s provided a pause in the regional rivalry, but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force. Saudi Arabia, wishing to contain Iran’s reach to the region’s minority Shiite populations, sought to harden Sunni-Shiite rifts. Government programs promoted “anti-Shia incitement in schools, Islamic universities, and the media,” Toby Matthiesen, an Oxford University scholar, wrote in a brief for the Carnegie Endowment. These policies, Dr. Matthiesen warned, cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the Islamic State. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, a Saudi ally. The United States, after expelling the Iraqis, established military bases in the region to defend its allies from Iraq. This further tilted the regional power balance against Iran, which saw the American forces as a threat. Iraq’s humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up, particularly in poorer communities that happened to be Shiite Arab. In response, Dr. Gause said, “Saddam’s regime became explicitly sectarian,” widening Sunni-Shiite divides to deter future uprisings. That allowed Iran, still worried about Iraq, to cultivate allies among Iraq’s increasingly disenfranchised Shiites, including militias that had risen up.
world/middleeast,Though it was not obvious at the time, Iraq had become a powder keg, one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later. The 2003 American-led invasion, by toppling an Iraqi government that had been hostile to both Saudi Arabia and Iran, upended the region’s power balance. Iran, convinced that the United States and Saudi Arabia would install a pliant Iraqi government — and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on Iran in the 1980s — raced to fill the postwar vacuum. Its leverage with Shiite groups, which are Iraq’s largest demographic group, allowed it to influence Baghdad politics. Iran also wielded Shiite militias to control Iraqi streets and undermine the American-led occupation. But sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum, hastening the country’s slide into civil war. Saudi Arabia sought to match Iran’s reach but, after years of oppressing its own Shiite population, struggled to make inroads with those in Iraq. “The problem for the Saudis is that their natural allies in Iraq,” Dr. Gause said, referring to Sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism, “wanted to kill them.” This was the first sign that Saudi Arabia’s strategy for containing Iran, by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the region’s Sunni majority, had backfired. As Sunni governments collapsed and Sunni militias turned to jihadism, Riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies. As their competition in Iraq heated up, Saudi Arabia and Iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state: Lebanon.
world/middleeast,Lebanon provided the perfect opening: a frail democracy recovering from civil war, with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion. Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited those dynamics, waging a new kind of proxy struggle “not on conventional military battlefields,” Dr. Gause said, but “within the domestic politics of weakened institutional structures.” Iran, for instance, supported Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political movement, which it had earlier cultivated to use against Israel. Riyadh, in turn, funneled money to political allies such as the Sunni prime minister, Rafik Hariri. By competing along Lebanon’s religious lines, they helped drive the Lebanese government’s frequent breakdowns, as parties relied on foreign backers who wanted to oppose one another more than build a functioning state. With Iran promoting Hezbollah as the nation’s defender and Saudi Arabia backing the Lebanese military, neither had a full mandate, and Lebanon struggled to maintain order. As the foreign powers escalated their antagonism, Lebanon’s dysfunction spiraled into violence. In 2005, after Mr. Hariri called for the withdrawal of Iranian-backed Syrian troops, he was assassinated. (Hezbollah has long been suspected.) Another political crisis, in 2008, culminated with Hezbollah overpowering Sunni militias to seize much of Beirut. Saudi Arabia requested United States air cover, according to a WikiLeaks cable, for a Pan-Arab force to retake the city. Though the intervention never materialized, the episode was a dress rehearsal for the turmoil that would soon come to the wider region.
world/middleeast,When the Arab Spring toppled governments across the Middle East, many of them Saudi allies, Riyadh feared that Iran would again fill the vacuums. So it rushed to close them, at times with force. It promised billions in aid to Jordan, Yemen, Egypt and others, often urging those governments to crack down. After pro-democracy protesters rose up in Bahrain, a Saudi ally whose Sunni king rules over a majority Shiite population, Saudi Arabia sent 1,200 troops. In Egypt, Saudi Arabia tacitly supported a 2013 military takeover, seeing the military as a more reliable ally than the elected Islamist government it replaced. As Libya fell into civil war, it backed a hard-line general who was driving to consolidate control. Though Iran has little influence in either country, Saudi Arabia’s fear of losing ground to Iran made it fight harder to retain influence wherever it could, analysts believe. Syria, an Iranian ally, reversed the usual dynamic. Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Sunni states steered money and arms to rebels, including Sunni Islamists. Iran intervened in turn, sending officers and later Hezbollah to fight on behalf of Syria’s government, whose leaders mostly follow a sect of Shiism. Their interventions, civil war scholars say, helped lock Syria in the ever-worsening stalemate that has killed over 400,000. The United States has struggled to restore the region’s balance. President Obama has urged Iran and Saudi Arabia “to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” he told The Atlantic.
world/middleeast,But Dr. Lynch called this plan for “a self-regulating equilibrium” between the Mideast powers “far-fetched.” The nuclear agreement with Iran, instead of calming Saudi nerves, hit on fears that “the United States wants to abandon them in order to ally with Iran,” Dr. Lynch said, calling the belief “crazy” but widespread. Mr. Pollack said he often heard Sunni Arab leaders express this as a metaphor. “They would say, ‘What is wrong with you people? You have this good, loving, loyal wife in us, and this crazy mistress in Iran. You don’t understand how bad she is for you, and yet you endlessly run off to her the moment that she winks at you,’” he recounted. The White House looked for other ways to reassure Saudi leaders, facilitating arms sales and overlooking Saudi actions in Egypt and Bahrain. Then came Yemen. A rebel group with loose ties to Iran ousted the Saudi-backed president, deepening Riyadh’s fears. Saudi Arabia launched a bombing campaign that inflicted horror on civilians but accomplished little else. The assault receives heavy American support, though the United States has few interests in Yemen other than counterterrorism and sometimes criticizes the campaign. In exchange, Riyadh acquiesced to the Iran deal and began to follow Washington’s lead on Syria. But the underlying proxy war remained. Asked when the Iran-Saudi struggle might cool, Mr. Pollack said he doubted that it would: “Where we’re headed with the Middle East is the current trend extrapolated, with more failed and failing governments.”
world/middleeast,In Yemen, this is already “reorganizing Yemeni society along sectarian lines and rearranging people’s relationships to one another on a non-nationalist basis,” Farea al-Muslimi, an analyst, wrote in a Carnegie Endowment paper, which cited similar trends across the region. Continued crises will risk sucking in the United States again, Mr. Lynch said, adding that no American president was likely to persuade Saudi Arabia or Iran to stay out of regional conflicts that it saw as potentially existential threats. President-elect Donald J. Trump will enter office having echoed Saudi Arabia’s view of the region. Iran “took over Iraq,” he said at a rally in January. “They’re going to have Yemen. They’re going to have Syria. They’re going to have everything.” Mentioning both the president-elect and Hillary Clinton, Dr. Gause said he doubted that any administration could reset the Middle East’s power struggles. “I do not think that the fundamental problem of the region,” he said, “is something that either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton could do that much about.”
politics,THE INAUGURATION: THE FAMILY; Proud Father and Son Bask in History's Glow - The New York Times In the days leading up to the inauguration, they talked about crying. Both son and father worried that they would go overboard with it, that a little telegenic mistiness might turn into something soggier. President-to-be George W. Bush said that he would not look too long or hard at his dad, lest the floodgates open. Former President George Bush joked that he had written his doctor to ask if he could ''prescribe anything to dry up tears.'' ''I hope if tears flow,'' the elder Mr. Bush told hundreds of well-wishers at a black-tie reception in his honor on Friday night, ''people understand that they are looking at the proudest father in the U.S.A.'' Anybody who watched him on the inaugural stage today could not help but see that. He was rapt as he took in every detail of his son's swearing-in, then lifted a hand to rub his eyes. And anybody who listened to his son's remarks could not help but detect a reciprocal depth of feeling. As George W. Bush recognized all the American presidents present at the inauguration, he paused after saying ''President Bush,'' then broke into a joyous smile. The elder Mr. Bush, 76, and the younger one, 54, were basking in the glow of history -- the 41st and 43rd presidents of the United States, a father-son act unrivaled in American politics since John Adams and John Quincy Adams. And that was more than a century and a half ago.
politics,But the Bushes were also experiencing something more intimate and nuanced, a peak moment of shared triumph in a father-son drama that could easily have turned out another way. There were years when ''Poppy'' watched ''W.'' wander -- and wondered where the irresolute young man was headed. There were years when ''W.'' tried to trace and walk in his father's footsteps -- and never quite got it right. There was tension, too, although neither acknowledges it anymore. But in 1973, when the elder Mr. Bush was chairman of the Republican National Committee and the younger one was about to begin business school at Harvard, George W. Bush drove after drinking too much, slammed a car into the garage of one of his parents' Washington neighbors and was instantly summoned by his father for a little talk. The son began that conversation by asking his father if he wanted to go ''mano a mano.'' His father did not accept the challenge. The two of them were always very different. The father excelled at Andover and Yale, fought in World War II, entered politics early and, by the time he became president in 1989, had qualifications galore. When he took office, expectations ran high. The son muddled through Andover and Yale, did not fight in Vietnam, entered politics extremely late and, as he became president today, had a resume of public service only six years long. As he takes office, expectations run lower.
politics,As recently as 1994, when George W. Bush mounted his first, successful campaign for Texas governor, his parents had doubts. He had never let off the sparks of a burning political ambition, and it was their next oldest son, Jeb, then running for Florida governor, who had been tacitly designated the heir to the throne. And then Jeb lost, while George W. won, abruptly rewriting the family rules and reshuffling its future. But the idea that his father never saw any great promise or intellect in George W. Bush gets oversold. There have long been facts to contradict it. In 1988, for example, his father picked him to work at the heart of his presidential campaign. ''It wasn't just that he knew W. would always be loyal and supportive,'' said Mary Matalin, a senior adviser to that campaign, in a recent interview. ''He trusted W. as a natural politician, and he knew they would be on the same wavelength.'' Over the last year and a half, the roles reversed. While former President Bush did not work in George W. Bush's campaign, he hovered large and tremulous on the sidelines, a quick, easy and frequently placed phone call away. Father and son talked daily during the legal contest over the votes in Florida, family friends said. After more than a decade of being wrapped in one another's careers, they were wrapped more tightly than ever. ''President Bush was a wreck,'' someone close to him recently remarked.
politics,The reason, his friends said, was the most ordinary of all. Despite all the talk of a Republican restoration, of one Bush avenging another's defeat, family friends said that it was not so very important to the former president that his son seize the reins of power. ''It was just important for him to have his son get something that he really wanted,'' explained Tom Rath, a Republican operative in New Hampshire who spent time last year around both Bushes. And it was important for the son, people who know him well said, to make his father proud. One of the new president's aides recently explained that while George W. Bush adores his mother, Barbara, he reveres his father. That is evident in the composition of his new administration, crowded with people his father had already deemed worthy. The elder Mr. Bush's defense secretary, Dick Cheney, is the younger Mr. Bush's vice president. The elder's deputy chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., is the younger's chief of staff. But the reverence is also evident in every syllable about his father that George W. Bush utters, in every look he throws his father's way. ''It's an incredibly deep emotional well that he draws from for his father,'' said Mark McKinnon, who was the chief media adviser for the 2000 Bush campaign. Mr. McKinnon recalled having dinner with father and son last summer at the Bush family's compound in Kennebunkport, Me. What Mr. McKinnon said he noticed was that ''they don't have to say all that much to each other for there to be this enormous love between them.''
politics,''I left the dinner and immediately called my own father,'' Mr. McKinnon added, ''to tell him I missed him.'' During the campaign, the younger Mr. Bush did not mention his father  that much, clearly wary of being seen as the beneficiary of some kind of nepotism. But more recently, he surrendered some of that caution. ''I've seen at close range the positive impact a leader can have,'' he said at a rally on Wednesday. ''My dad taught me, in the way he lived, that life is more than personal gain,'' Mr. Bush added. And today, at a luncheon after his inauguration, he called the event ''a testimony to two wonderful parents, people who instilled values and gave unconditional love.'' For his part, former President Bush showed scattered signs over the last few weeks that he was living vicariously -- or reliving vicariously -- through his son. ''He loves to be brought up to date on what's going on,'' George W. Bush said in an interview a little more than a week ago, explaining that his father would call him simply to ask about the material covered in that morning's national security briefing. At Friday night's reception, the former president joked that while he used to be the ''George'' and the ''president'' among the Bushes, he did not know ''what the hell I am'' anymore. That was not really true.
politics,He knows that he is a nervous father, the first since Joseph P. Kennedy to witness his son's inauguration. He knows that he is an emotional father, so much so that, for several weeks now, ''he cries at the drop of a hat,'' a family friend said. And he knows that he managed an accomplishment, if that is the right word for it, only one other American was ever able to claim. He made that clear when, on Friday night, he told the Republican power elite, ''I'm going home Sunday, and leave this to Mr. Quincy.''
nyregion,Sheldon Silver’s Lawyers Criticize U.S. Attorney - The New York Times Lawyers for Assemblyman Sheldon Silver filed a motion on Tuesday to dismiss his indictment on the ground that Preet Bharara, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, orchestrated a “media firestorm” that deprived their client of the presumption of innocence and prejudiced his case in court. “The effect of the U.S. attorney’s actions is to convict in the media before even calling his first witness,” Mr. Silver’s lawyers said in the motion, citing what they characterized as Mr. Bharara’s “improper extrajudicial statements.” Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who at the time of his arrest was the speaker of the State Assembly, is charged with mail and wire fraud and extortion under the color of official right. At a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Silver, through one of his lawyers, pleaded not guilty to the charges contained in an indictment returned last week. Mr. Silver, 71, standing in the corridor after the court hearing, said only, “I am confident I will be vindicated in the courtroom.” Steven F. Molo, one of Mr. Silver’s lawyers, told Judge Valerie E. Caproni at the hearing that the defense was filing the dismissal motion, claiming that Mr. Bharara’s comments had ignited “nothing less than a media firestorm.” Mr. Molo cited a news conference that Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, gave on the day charges were announced; a speech he gave the next day at New York Law School; and an interview he gave to MSNBC, all before the grand jury returned the indictment.
nyregion,“It was orchestrated,” Mr. Molo contended, saying the action had the “significant effect of compromising” the pending grand jury proceeding and “depriving Mr. Silver of his right to a presumption of innocence.” In court, Carrie H. Cohen, an assistant United States attorney, called the allegations “baseless” and said her office welcomed the opportunity to respond. “There was certainly no prejudice in the grand jury proceeding,” she added.Mr. Silver, a Lower East Side Democrat who has served in the Assembly since 1977 and was its speaker for two decades, is accused by the government of exploiting his position to obtain nearly $4 million in corrupt payments through two law firms over the last 15 years. Prosecutors say Mr. Silver masked his illicit earnings by portraying the money as legitimate income from practicing law. In one scheme, the government says, Mr. Silver provided state grants to a doctor who referred asbestos victims to a personal injury law firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, which paid Mr. Silver a portion of the money it earned from the cases. He is also accused of steering real estate developers to another law firm, Goldberg & Iryami, which is said to have paid him kickbacks disguised as referral fees. Ms. Cohen said in court that prosecutors would call 20 to 25 witnesses and that their case would take about three weeks to present. Mr. Molo said the defense case would take at least a week. Judge Caproni has not yet set a trial date.
nyregion,In their motion filed on Tuesday, Mr. Silver’s lawyers accused Mr. Bharara of having prosecuted their client’s case “full-bore through the press.” “During his many public appearances,” the defense wrote, “he has ventured far beyond the neutral recitations of the charges that once accompanied such events. Instead, he has offered his uncensored views about Mr. Silver’s guilt, his character and the severity of his crimes — always in inflammatory, over-the-top language that targets not just Mr. Silver but the entire New York State government.” The lawyers wrote that six hours before Mr. Silver was arrested on the morning of Jan. 22, when a criminal complaint was still under seal, news reports, attributed to unnamed “law enforcement sources,” began appearing about the speaker’s imminent arrest and the substance of the charges against him. The lawyers also cited Mr. Bharara’s news conference about the case later that day, and his law school speech the next day. Mr. Bharara “continued his publicity campaign” two weeks later, the defense lawyers wrote, with the MSNBC interview. The indictment was returned on Feb. 19, the lawyers wrote, “right in the midst of that media circus.” The lawyers asked Judge Caproni, at a minimum, to poll the grand jurors who indicted Mr. Silver and to order disclosure of the normally secret grand jury minutes. “It strains credulity to think that grand jurors who returned their indictment smack in the middle of the U.S. attorney’s press campaign would not have been affected by that coverage,” the lawyers wrote.
books/review,BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION & POETRY - The New York Times THE GIRL FROM THE GOLDEN HORN By Kurban Said. Overlook, $25.95. The story of the author of this 1938 novel, written in German and now appearing in English for the first time, is nearly as exotic as the book itself. Kurban Said is a pseudonym taken by the Jewish writer Lev Nussimbaum to protect himself from the Nazis. Nussimbaum, who is believed to have been born in what is now Azerbaijan in 1905, eventually settled in Berlin and Vienna and died in Italy in 1942. Before he became Kurban Said, though, he was Essad Bey, a Turkish name he adopted after he fell under the spell of the East and took to wearing turbans and passing himself off as the son of a Muslim lord. The author of at least 14 books, he wrote only one other novel, ''Ali and Nino,'' which has something of a cult following. (If these aren't twists enough, the family of an Austrian baroness alleges that she was actually the author of ''Ali and Nino.'') In any case, the plots of both novels concern the same conflict between East and West that obsessed Nussimbaum personally. In ''The Girl From the Golden Horn,'' a Muslim girl, Asiadeh, the daughter of a Turkish pasha who has fled to Berlin in the 1920's after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, falls in love with and marries a Viennese doctor. But she soon crosses paths with a Hollywood screenwriter, John Rolland, who, improbably, turns out to be the Turkish prince to whom she was long ago betrothed. Asiadeh must choose between the two men. It would spoil the suspense to reveal which man Asiadeh chooses, and suspense is perhaps the only reason to read this novel. In addition to its contrived plot, the book is burdened with philosophical discussions of the split between East and West, which, though they have new resonance today, feel didactic and polemical.

world/europe,British Police Detail Clues in Death of Berezovsky - The New York Times LONDON — In a first brief detailing of the circumstances surrounding the recent death of the exiled Russian oligarch Boris A. Berezovsky, a British police officer said Thursday that Mr. Berezovsky was found lying on his bathroom floor with a “ligature around his neck and a piece of similar material on the shower rail above him.” The officer, Detective Inspector Mark Bissell, confirmed an earlier police finding that Mr. Berezovsky’s death was “consistent with hanging.” However, in an assessment that seemed certain to provoke fresh speculation about the nature of the case, he said that while there was no evidence of a violent struggle, the involvement of another person “cannot be completely eliminated, as tests remain outstanding.” The officer said that toxicologists would continue tests on Mr. Berezovsky’s body, which could take weeks, and that there would be further searches at Mr. Berezovksy’s home in Ascot, west of London. He was speaking at the opening of an inquest into Mr. Berezovsky’s death, held at Windsor, west of London. In Britain, inquests are held to establish the cause of unusual deaths and do not generally ascribe blame. Throughout, Mr. Berezovsky was referred to as Platon Elenin, British news reports said, the name that he took in 2004 and that was used on travel documents issued by the British authorities.
world/europe,Mr. Berezovsky, 67, was last seen alive by an employee on Friday night. The same employee discovered his body in a locked bathroom the following day, setting off intense speculation over the final hours of one of the Kremlin’s most vocal critics, who was once one of the most important power brokers in 1990s Russia. The police said Monday there were no signs of violence. “The results of the post-mortem examination, carried out by a Home Office pathologist, have found the cause of death is consistent with hanging,” a police statement said then. “The pathologist has found nothing to indicate a violent struggle.” Mr. Berezovsky fled Russia in 2000 after falling out with President Vladimir V. Putin, whom he had once helped to secure power. In London, he set himself up as the focal point of émigrés seeking Mr. Putin’s ouster, resisting Russian efforts to have him sent back on criminal charges. One of his associates, Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer, died of radiation poisoning in 2006 after ingesting a rare isotope, polonium 210, from a cup of tea at an upscale London hotel. British prosecutors are seeking the extradition from Russia of another former K.G.B. officer, Andrei K. Lugovoi, who has denied murder charges. Flamboyant and impetuous, Mr. Berezovsky was frequently in the headlines, most notably last October when, in a stunning reversal of his fortunes and life style, he lost a spectacular $5.1 billion lawsuit against a former protégé, Roman A. Abramovich, the billionaire who owns the Chelsea soccer club and many other interests, including businesses and yachts.
world/europe,The courtroom defeat left Mr. Berezovsky with huge legal fees, friends said, and sent him into a profound depression. In a statement released through the police on Wednesday, the family of his second wife, Galina Besharova, paid glowing tribute to him, contrasting with a far less salubrious image of the onetime billionaire sponsored by the Kremlin and Mr. Berezovsky’s critics in Russia and elsewhere. The tribute, the police said, was written by a daughter, Anastasia, and said: “My father was not the typical parent, nothing about him was ordinary. He has colored my life in infinite ways, and I know that what he concerned himself most with was making all his children proud. “His determination and excitement for every aspect of life is something that stands out in even my earliest memories of him and that will always remain deep in my heart. “He has taught me many things about this world. He has taught me to never stop fighting for what one believes in no matter what the costs may be. I doubt anyone could have met a man with a stronger presence, or with charm that was more overwhelming than the one my father possessed. “There aren’t enough words in any language that can somehow express everything that he was and everything he will continue to be. The only word that comes close is extraordinary.”
science,THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; The New Treatment Cheney Did Not Get - The New York Times Doctors caring for political leaders and celebrities often become embroiled in medical controversies over how they did -- or did not -- treat their patients. Some debates reflect the many ways to treat certain ailments successfully. Still other disagreements involve outside doctors who become public second-guessers for reasons like ego, rivalry, promoting a specialty, or marketing a product or technique they helped develop. Last week, Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, Vice President Dick Cheney's cardiologist, found himself at the center of a debate among some in the medical field over his decision to clear a blocked coronary artery in Mr. Cheney and then not to use a new radiation technique to help prevent another blockage. The blockage was caused by scarring in a wire-meshed stent that Dr. Reiner had placed in Mr. Cheney's diagonal coronary artery at George Washington University Hospital in November after his fourth heart attack. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have received stents, saving many from the bypass surgery that Mr. Cheney had in 1988. But in about 25 percent of recipients, stents set off serious inflammation and scarring known as restenosis.
science,The radiation technique that Dr. Reiner did not use is intended to prevent new scarring after a blocked stent is opened. In November, the Food and Drug Administration licensed two types of devices that use either beta or gamma radiation after studies showed that they could reduce the chances of blockage from further scarring by about 60 percent. The Novoste Corp. of Norcross, Ga., makes a beta device and Cordis, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, makes a gamma device. (The types differ in radiation energy -- beta radiation in the form of electrons penetrates tissues less than gamma in the form of photons.) The debate in Mr. Cheney's case partly reflects the fact that doctors at George Washington did not have the device when he might have needed it. Mr. Cheney is donating millions to the George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates for a cardiovascular institute in his name. Dr. Reiner belongs to the group, which he describes as an incorporated nonprofit organization separate from the university and hospital. Cordis has encountered delays in delivering its radiation product but is speeding up delivery to George Washington to March 21 because of Mr. Cheney, said David Swearingen, a company spokesman. Dr. Reiner, who has taken the one-day training course for the gamma radiation technique, said he would have transferred Mr. Cheney to a nearby hospital that offered such treatment if he believed his patient needed it. Many cardiologists not connected with the case have said that by not being irradiated, Mr. Cheney is being subjected to a higher possibility of another angioplasty and hospital stay. But the critics did not say that Mr. Cheney received bad medical care; most said the decision was a tossup in his type of blocked stent. Mr. Cheney could still get the radiation, if needed.
science,Short-term findings, up to five years, have made radiation a promising prevention technique for blocked stents. But medical leaders have cautioned against widespread use until many questions are answered about long-term effectiveness and safety of coronary artery radiation in larger numbers of patients. Meanwhile, cardiologists debate whether to use the radiation techniques for the first restenosis or save it until a second one develops. In interviews over the weekend, Dr. Reiner said he respectfully disagreed with his critics' viewpoint. ''I enjoy a lively discourse, and I don't mind folks evaluating what we do,'' Dr. Reiner said. But, he also said, the eager second-guessing from doctors who do not know all the facts in Mr. Cheney's case ''has been a little frustrating and disappointing.'' Dr. Reiner spoke with Mr. Cheney's permission, but he said the vice president had not authorized disclosure of all the medical facts in his case. After Mr. Cheney, 60, complained to him about ''a little chest burning'' on March 5, Dr. Reiner said he told his patient to go to George Washington. There, the doctor inserted a tube into an artery in Mr. Cheney's thigh, threaded it into the coronary arteries surrounding his heart, and took angiogram X-rays that found one end of the stent was nearly blocked in the diagonal artery, which was three millimeters in diameter Using an ultrasound device, Dr. Reiner then examined the blocked stent and said he ''was encouraged'' to find that the affected area was short (one to two millimeters in length) and limited to a specific point in the stent that otherwise was clear.
science,To Dr. Reiner, the critical point for withholding radiation was that the scarring was not spread throughout the stent. He said he believed that by inflating a balloon on the tip of a catheter to clear the blockage without taking the extra step of radiation there was ''a reasonable likelihood of getting a durable result.'' Although the radiation is very low,  Dr. Reiner pointed to its potential adverse effects that include restenosis from uneven radiation at the edges of the stent, heart attacks from blood clots that form months after the radiation, aneurysms (ballooning of coronary arteries) and more remotely, cancer. At a news conference just after completing the procedure on March 5, Dr. Reiner said that Mr. Cheney had at least a 40 percent chance of needing another angioplasty within six months because of a second restenosis. But Dr. Reiner said that on Friday a researcher told him that he would soon report a study that showed a 20 percent restenosis rate for Mr. Cheney's type of problem. ''Because I injured the vessel again with the balloon, there certainly is a possibility that the stent will renarrow,'' thus increasing the odds that radiation will be added to another angioplasty, if needed, Dr. Reiner said. There is no way to predict who develops a restenosis and whether it will be focal or diffuse.
science,Other cardiologists suggested that Mr. Cheney would be wise to undergo a scheduled angiogram in two to three months to detect any early blockage before it caused symptoms, particularly if they occurred while he was traveling. But Dr. Reiner said he had no plan to perform such a test unless Mr. Cheney developed symptoms again. Dr. Reiner disagreed with criticism that not having the radiation equipment available influenced his treatment judgment, saying that even if he had had the equipment, he would not have used it in Mr. Cheney's case. If the blockage had been diffuse, Dr. Reiner said he ''would have considered irradiation more strongly.''  Because he did not have the equipment, he said, he would have transferred Mr. Cheney that day to another hospital like Washington Hospital Center, which has the equipment, or he would have waited to perform the procedure after George Washington received the equipment. The technique involves coordinating the cardiologist with a radiation oncologist and physicist to deliver a measured amount of radiation in beads that are strung in a ribbon and inserted through a catheter to the site of the repaired stent and artery. The staff leaves the room for the treatment period of 10 minutes or so, still monitoring the patient, and then returns to remove the beads and resume its work. The radiation is a one-time procedure and adds about $4,000 to the $12,000 or so cost of angioplasty.
science,''When you look at a technology in its infancy, I think it is often appropriate to be a little circumspect about applying it, especially using something like gamma radiation,'' Dr. Reiner said. He went on: ''It is a technology that we will see used more frequently, but although we feel that it is safe, especially in the doses of radiation delivered to the coronary arteries, it still is applying radiation energy to the human body.'' Colleagues at George Washington have participated in and consulted on Mr. Cheney's care, Dr. Reiner said, explaining that ''I have the luxury of working within a group that offers a collegial and collaborative process.'' Dr. Reiner said he had not formally consulted with experts elsewhere, although several cardiologists had  called to offer support. Dr. Reiner said he had ''not spoken to Mr. Cheney since he left the hospital'' on March 6. Cardiologists who perform angioplasties usually instruct patients to report symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath. But Dr. Reiner is like many cardiologists who do not routinely call their patients after the procedure. ''Absent recurrence of symptoms, there really is nothing to chat about,'' Dr. Reiner said. Dr. Reiner also said he had not spoken with White House doctors since Mr. Cheney left the hospital and had not asked them to increase their monitoring because ''they are pretty vigilant to begin with.''
science,When Dr. Reiner next examines Mr. Cheney in about another week, one thing on his checklist is to weigh him. After extensive discussions between the doctors and the Cheney family about his diet, the vice president has lost more than 10 pounds since his heart attack in November, in part by exercise and by having an aide serve chicken, fish and salads rather than beef and other items. In talking with Mr. Cheney, Dr. Reiner said, ''he does not strike me as a man who is stressed'' and ''I am not at all convinced that this is a stressful job for him, although he obviously feels some stress.'' But, Dr. Reiner added, ''There is a difference between having a job of enormous responsibility, which he does have, and being highly stressed by your job, which he is not, and I think he thrives in this environment.'' The stress may have been less on the patient than on Dr. Reiner, who said he was ''beat after a hard week.'' ''The easiest part of caring for the vice president has been delivering care to him,'' Dr. Reiner said. ''Dealing with the media and critics has been more difficult.''
your-money,Affordable Care Act’s Tax Effects Now Loom for Filers - The New York Times If you decided to skip health insurance this year, consider this: Unless you can prove you have a valid excuse, you will be liable for a penalty during the coming tax season — and the time to start making your case is now. That’s not all. People who bought subsidized insurance through one of the marketplaces may have new tax forms to complete, while paying the penalty itself may demand some serious number-crunching. The Internal Revenue Service is gearing up to answer questions, but it warns that only half of the callers may get through — and those who succeed may have to wait a half-hour or more. “There are quite a number of moving parts that taxpayers have not had to deal with,” said Kristin Esposito, technical tax manager for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act — including its penalty provision — is in effect for the first time this year and will be reconciled through a person’s tax return. For most taxpayers, this will simply mean checking a box on a tax return indicating they had insurance for the full year. But millions of others will have to grapple with new tax forms and calculations that may generate unexpected results. For instance, most of the 6.7 million people who bought insurance through the exchanges received subsidies, which reduced their monthly premiums. But those subsidies were based on previous years’ income — so people whose incomes have changed will inevitably have to pay some of that money back, while others may receive fatter refunds.
your-money,Paying the penalty may also deliver some surprises. People who were uninsured for more than three consecutive months may owe something. (And since the penalty will double next year, now is the time to determine how much that might cost, before it is too late to buy a health policy through a federal or state-run marketplace for 2015.) “This is a learning experience for everyone involved,” said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. “When you combine that with all of the problems with the exchanges, there will be a lot of confusion and people will be sorting it out. I am sure the I.R.S. will be inundated with calls.” But be prepared to hit redial. John Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, admitted in a recent speech that because of budget constraints, the agency may be equipped to answer just over half of the phone calls it receives. Many will get a “courtesy disconnect.” The tax filing season will also serve as yet another big test for the federal government, since it will require several government entities — the state and federal marketplaces and the I.R.S. among them — to share data and send out new tax forms with accurate information in a timely manner. Here are some of the biggest ways the new law may affect taxpayers:
your-money,EXEMPTIONS Consumer advocates said they were concerned that some taxpayers might not realize that they needed to apply for certain exemptions, and, in some cases, substantiate their circumstances. (An estimated 23 million people will qualify for an exemption in 2016, while many others will be granted a pass because of a hardship, according to a federal analysis.) Some exemptions must be applied for through the exchanges, while others can be claimed only on income tax returns and some can be granted through either channel. (The I.R.S. and Healthcare.gov have lists of where to apply for each). For instance, people who cannot find affordable coverage — costing 8 percent of household income or less — must claim that exemption on their tax returns. But the most time-consuming exemptions require mailing a signed paper application to the exchanges: These are processed manually, which can take a couple of weeks. Those exemptions include several hardships, such as foreclosure, the death of a family member, unpaid medical bills and eviction, as well as religious reasons for not using insurance. “Do it now because it’s a cumbersome process,” advised Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Once an exemption is approved (and if it’s not, the applicant can appeal), a taxpayer is sent an “exemption certificate number,” which should be entered on the tax return. “We know in some cases those certificates have not come back yet,” said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, private insurance program director at Families USA, a consumer advocacy group.
your-money,TurboTax, the tax-preparation software brand, has a free exemption check tool that can determine if taxpayers qualify and help them apply. PENALTIES Uninsured people who cannot qualify for an exemption will be required to pay a penalty, also known as the individual shared responsibility payment. Even people who went without insurance for more than three months may have to pay something. The penalties will rise sharply over the next couple of years, so taxpayers contemplating paying the penalty instead of buying insurance for the coming year should run those calculations soon: Open enrollment on the health care exchanges runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. For the 2014 tax year, individuals pay whichever is more: $95 or 1 percent of the portion of their modified adjusted gross income that exceeds the federal income tax filing threshold: $10,150, for example, for those with single filing status. But payments are calculated on a monthly basis for each household member. Those figures are about to double. A family of four earning $100,000 who skipped coverage in the last year would owe just shy of $800 in 2014, but it would need to pay nearly $1,650 in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center’s calculator, which can determine how much a taxpayer might pay. There is some question about how aggressive the I.R.S. will be in collecting the penalty in its first year. But in 2016, an estimated four million people will pay penalties, according to a federal analysis.
your-money,The agency will not be permitted to resort to its usual collection tactics, such as using levies — like wage garnishment — or liens. It cannot criminally prosecute those who do not comply, either. But the I.R.S. can deduct the penalty from any refund due. And if a taxpayer isn’t owed a refund — and fails to pay the penalty — the amount will accrue interest and roll over into the following tax years. The I.R.S. could continue to deduct the growing amount from any refunds due for 10 years, which is how long the agency is allowed to collect payments. RECONCILING People who bought subsidized insurance on the exchanges received what is actually an advance on a tax credit. Since the amount of help taxpayers received was based on 2012 income, it will need to be reconciled against what they actually earned in 2014 — particularly if they earned more or less and did not update their income data on the exchange. Some people will be surprised that they must pay some of that money back, or at least have it deducted from what they would have received in a refund. Conversely, people who earned less money in 2014 — and who received subsidies that were too small — may receive money back. Changes in life circumstances — a divorce, marriage, a new child — can also affect those numbers.
your-money,“This is the part that can be very complex,” said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. “People think of the tax credit as a discount on their premium. But realizing it can be something you repay a portion of is going to be a surprise.” Taxpayers may be comforted that there are caps on the amount that must be paid back, though a family of four with a household income exceeding $94,200 would have to pay back the full amount if it received too much in premium subsidies. But some taxpayers who are on the edge of losing premium subsidies may be able to reduce their incomes enough to qualify for the credits. For instance, people can contribute to a retirement account — like a 401(k), 403(b) or traditional I.R.A. (and I.R.A. contributions for 2014 can be made by April 15 for the 2014 tax year), tax experts said. “This is the perfect time to look at their income,” Ms. Pickering added, “because they still have time to make a change.”

magazine,New Sentences: From ‘The Great Nadar,’ by Adam Begley - The New York Times A parenthetical sentence is a paradoxical thing. It straddles worlds: It is both inside and outside the text simultaneously, included and excluded. It is not quite important enough to merit the full center-stage spotlight but also not unimportant enough to be shoved entirely behind a curtain. A pair of parentheses is the sound of a text leaning over and whispering to us. The sentence quoted above is a particularly wonderful example. It refers to a celebrated 19th-century French surgeon, Baron Guillaume Dupuytren. His storied career, however, is immediately undercut by the way it is reduced to this single parenthetical detail. The sentence unspools with perfect comic cruelty. For nine words, all we know is that the great doctor treated a great man — the most powerful man in 19th-century France. The 10th word arrives like a pie in the face. All that accrued historical glamour is suddenly attached to the least glamorous possible medical condition. It is a perfect poetic expression of deflated glory: Napoleon’s hemorrhoids. (It is also the perfect name for your hard-core punk band, if you’re into that kind of thing.) That we learn all of this in parentheses, as a kind of whispered aside, only makes it funnier. It’s like a friend saying, ‘‘I’m eating the most delicious cannoli from the best pastry shop in all of Boston — here, try a bite,’’ and then, just as you raise it to your lips, whispering, ‘‘I got it out of the garbage.’’

And it wasn’t even a normal part of the front-flap jacket copy — all the pseudo-sentient hand-waving that passes for plot summary in the world of Dan Brown, in which the great triumphs of human thought are reduced to windup toys skittering around a shoe-box maze. The brilliant codesmetologist thought hard with his brain-box, using Sir Isaac Newton’s impeccable physics theorems to unravel the secret nature of Ludwig van Beethoven’s most famous sonata in order to save the beautiful woman. No, get this: The sentence was in code. It was hidden in the text of the front flap the way a bunny is hidden in a cloud in a children’s magazine. I knew it was a code because certain letters were in bold, and as I pieced the message together, letter by letter — w-h-e-r-e — I started to laugh — d-o — and it was not the laughter of pleasure — w-e — but of sheer terror at the mockery capitalism makes of genuine human thought — c-o-m-e — and of course I knew what the sentence was going to say before I even reached its end — f-r-o-m — but I had to keep going, and the terrified laughter did not stop, and I have not stopped laughing since.
sports,In Loss to Real Madrid, P.S.G. Fails on the Big Stage It Covets - The New York Times MADRID — No matter how hard Paris Saint-Germain pushes, no matter many superstars it acquires, no matter how many hundreds of millions of dollars it spends, that glass ceiling simply will not break. Yet again, at the moment it was supposed to make its giant leap, the world’s richest club froze. P.S.G.’s list of Champions League disappointments already included Barcelona (2015 and 2017), Manchester (2016) and London (2014). Now, add Madrid (2018). Off the field, P.S.G.’s financial might, its naked ambition, is capable of making the game’s traditional elite shudder and tremble. On the field, under the brightest of lights, it can only stumble and fall. This was, of course, only the first leg of P.S.G.’s tie with Real Madrid in the Champions League’s round of 16. There are 90 minutes, at least, left in which to rectify things. Losing by 3-1 on Wednesday still offers a glimmer of hope; that single goal on the road could yet prove crucial. P.S.G. is not out, not yet. But there was an unavoidable sense in those dying minutes, as Cristiano Ronaldo bundled Madrid ahead and Marcelo stretched its lead, that it was all happening again: Against the very best, P.S.G. was being exposed as a mere pretender. It was impossible, as soon as this tie was confirmed, not to see it as a battle between the establishment and the insurgent.
sports,Real Madrid, like P.S.G., obsesses over the Champions League, though its reasons are very different. To Real, this competition is a central part of its identity: It has won the trophy 12 times, including three of the last four years; the European Cup defines what Real is. In Parisian eyes, by contrast, the competition is a symbol of what P.S.G. wishes — no, craves — to be. There is no glory in winning the French domestic championship, not for a club with a budget vastly larger than any of its rivals’. There is no pride in claiming either of the country’s domestic cups, not to a Qatari ownership group that got involved in soccer to accrue that unique soft power, that sense of relevance that the world’s most popular sport offers. Only the Champions League justifies the investment, only the Champions League validates the project, only the Champions League brings Qatar the kudos it desires: proof that what was once a backwater can become a global player. It was for the Champions League that P.S.G. sanctioned a $276 million move last summer for Neymar, the Brazilian superstar. It did not sign him from Barcelona, in the words of the midfielder Adrien Rabiot, to help P.S.G. “score eight against Dijon.” The club does not indulge Neymar — throwing him a lavish, two-day birthday party earlier this month and giving him a variety of “privileges,” in Rabiot’s words again, that others do not enjoy — to perform party tricks in Ligue 1. It does so because it sees him as the sort of player who can deliver in these moments, on the biggest stages, against the most illustrious opponents.
sports,His ability to do so is not in question: P.S.G. knows that all too well — it was Neymar, after all, who orchestrated that humiliation in Barcelona last year. In Madrid, though, in Parisian colors, he could not repeat the trick. For his part, Neymar’s decision to leave Catalonia centered on his desire to establish himself as the best player in the world, the standard-bearer for the generation behind Lionel Messi and Ronaldo. He could not be heralded as the finest player on the planet, ran the logic, if he was not the finest player on his team. If, from the outside, it looked almost like a step down, there was a sense that the ambitions of player and team meshed rather neatly. Both, after all, had their eyes on usurping the established order. For Neymar, then, as much as P.S.G., this was a night to shine, and not just because Real has convinced itself that the Brazilian yearns to make Madrid his permanent home. This was his chance to demonstrate that his move to Paris had been more than folly, that change was coming. He did not do it. Neymar did not decide this game: Ronaldo, the man he would depose, did. It should not be a source of great controversy to suggest that Ronaldo, at 33, is now beyond his wondrous peak, no longer the force of nature he once was. He has had to metamorphose into something different to remain pre-eminent. Where once Ronaldo’s embroidery — his dazzling array of tricks, his jet heels — set him apart, now it is his economy, his ruthlessness.
sports,Twice, when the pressure was greatest, Ronaldo delivered. Not prettily, necessarily — he converted a penalty kick to draw Real level, after Rabiot had given P.S.G. the lead, and then scuttled the ball home fortuitously to put his team ahead — but decisively. It was a model of efficiency, an object lesson of what big players do in big moments. Neymar was the opposite: endless slaloming dribbles, drifting effortlessly past defenders with sure touches and elegant movement — all culminating in cul-de-sacs. It was an inherently cinematic performance. He played as you imagine a superstar should, as opposed to how a superstar does. He will have a chance, in Paris next month, to make amends. Unai Emery, his coach, saw enough here to believe his team can score the two goals it needs to progress to the quarterfinals (though it may well require more). The score line, he said, “does not reflect what we saw on the pitch.” P.S.G. has heard that line before. It has felt this sensation before. It is the mantra of a team that gets so far and then can go no further: We are so close, we will get there in the end. The ceiling, though, never seems to shift. It always there, just beyond reach, unyielding, unforgiving.
t-magazine,The Colossal Strangeness of China’s Most Excellent Tourist City - The New York Times Ordos, like so many of the country’s hundreds of new towns, is famous for being empty — a symbol, some would say, of the hubris of rampant urbanization. But the few people who live there see it differently. ORDOS, A MAGICAL LAND in the just north of China, is a dazzling pearl in the world history and culture. That’s what it says — verbatim, in ungrammatical English — on a plaque that greets you as you enter a rotunda in the Ordos Museum. The city of Ordos sits in a coal-rich wilderness of desert and grassland at the southwestern edge of the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia. It is not even 15 years old and has a minuscule population compared to most Chinese cities. But those facts have not constrained Ordos’s municipal rhetoric. In the museum’s exhibition devoted to Genghis Khan you are told that when the great warrior traveled through in the early 13th century, he praised Ordos as a paradise, an ideal home for both children and old people, with a natural landscape of unrivaled beauty. Signs welcome visitors to “the famous tourist city,” “the most excellent tourist city” and “the top tourist city in China.” The word Ordos itself is a kind of boast: In Mongolian, it means “many palaces.”
t-magazine,The outside world has come to know Ordos by a different title: as a ghost city. In recent years, Ordos has emerged as the most famous, and most infamous, of China’s overbuilt and underpopulated instant cities — a would-be “Dubai on the Steppe,” designed to accommodate hundreds of thousands of residents but home to comically few. Internet slide shows and international television crews have captured scenes of skyscrapers and statues looming over empty streets, and pundits have seized on Ordos as a metaphor for the hubris and folly of China’s rampant urbanization. It is true that China is in the throes of a transformation without analogue or precedent. Experts say that in the next two decades, hundreds of millions of rural Chinese will move into hundreds of newly built cities — the biggest building boom, and the largest migration, in human history. Last March, China’s State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party released a report, the “National New-Type Urbanization Plan,” announcing the government’s intention to boost the proportion of the nation’s population living in cities to 60 percent by 2020. To meet that goal, China will need to bring 100 million new residents to cities over the next five years. The estimated cost of the plan is $6.8 trillion.
t-magazine,Ordos, in other words, is not exactly unique: Everywhere in China, new cities are springing up and spreading out over recently paved countryside. What makes Ordos a special case are the mineral deposits beneath it. The land surrounding Ordos City sits on one-sixth of China’s coal reserves. In the early 2000s, China began awarding mining rights to private companies, which generated massive tax revenues, swelling municipal coffers. The government poured much of that windfall into the development of a monumental new district, Kangbashi New Area; hundreds of millions of dollars in capital investment flowed in, spurring a construction boom on a staggering scale. The cycle that was unleashed is familiar: speculation and debt, boom and bust, a real-estate bubble that burst cataclysmically amid downturns in the volatile coal market. Today, the real-estate situation in Ordos has turned macabre. Video billboards along the city’s major roadways display mug shots of fugitive developers who have skipped town, fleeing their debts. There are rumors about the dynamiting of buildings in Kangbashi: about owners of unoccupied apartment towers who hope to create value through destruction, reselling freshly cleared land to new investors. To the extent that “the famous tourist city” attracts sightseers, they are the morbidly curious, who pilgrimage to Ordos to experience its eeriness. What they find there, though, may come as a surprise. In the shadows of the deserted construction sites and vacant hotels, there are people. They are the citizens of Ordos — not the inhabitants of a ghost town, but the pioneers of a novel kind of 21st-century urban life.
t-magazine,FOR THE NEWLY ARRIVED visitor, the most shocking thing about Ordos may be its cleanliness. On a mild, overcast day this past autumn, the sleek steel-and-glass terminal at Ejin Horo Airport gave off the gleam of a model kitchen at a high-end department store. The city’s impeccably landscaped roadways were equally pristine. In fact, the first human beings spotted on a taxi ride from the airport into the center of Ordos weren’t pedestrians — there were few of those — but municipal cleaning crews, tidying the sidewalks and broad, multilane thoroughfares. It was an absurdist scene worthy of Ionesco or Beckett: corps of street sweepers pushing brooms on streets that didn’t need to be swept. The closest thing to litter in Ordos is the sand that is now and then whipped up by winds in the surrounding desert and blown into town.
t-magazine,The scale of that town is cartoon-ishly huge. The dimensions of its plazas, the width of its roads, the square footage of its municipal and residential buildings — everything in Ordos seems like it has been attached to a helium pump and inflated to gargantuan size. In Kangbashi, there are dozens of apartment towers and hotels, many reaching 15 stories high, with looping circular drives and sweeping lobbies. The Ordos Museum is a mammoth blob that owes something to Frank Gehry; next door, there’s an enormous library designed to look like books stacked on a shelf. The population of Inner Mongolia is not very Mongolian: There are about four times as many Han Chinese as there are citizens of Mongol extraction. But in Kangbashi, the government has built a kind of Mongolian Disneyland, a city packed with kitsch monuments that evoke the heritage and heroism of life on the steppes. There is a theater shaped like a gigantic yurt; there are streetlamps that take the form of bows and arrows. Everywhere you look, there are horses: murals of Mongol warriors on horseback, a suspension bridge with stanchions in the shape of stallions’ manes. The biggest statue in town shows a pair of massive horses rearing up on their hind legs, each as tall as a small New York tenement building.
t-magazine,Images of this architectural excess, circulated on the Internet, have captured the imagination of the outside world. What these photos omit are the people who inhabit the cityscape. On a blustery afternoon in Kangbashi not long ago, groups of men and women in their teens and early 20s gathered on the steps of the museum and the library, and in the adjacent plaza. Some rode skateboards; a group of kids played basketball on a court just outside the library. The dress code was the same that you see across urban East Asia: lots of brand-name sneakers, hooded sweatshirts and other totems of Western culture. A girl of about 13 arrived on a mountain bike, wearing a baseball cap that read “Chris Brown.” (The R&B star, she explained in English, is her favorite musician.) A little while later, a car came past, blaring slogans and music through a roof-mounted megaphone: a mobile advertisement for Ordos’s newest supermarket. The announcer touted the market’s fresh produce and invoked “Big Big,” a popular nickname for China’s President, Xi Jinping. The soundtrack was the theme music from “Dallas,” the 1980s TV hit. Nearby, seated outside the library, were a group of five young women, all 19. Two were Mongolian and three were Han Chinese; all of them had come to Ordos from small villages in Inner Mongolia to attend Beijing Normal University, which has opened a Kangbashi branch. “It’s nice here,” said one of the women. “My hometown is a tiny place in the grassland. The people here are more well educated. There’s so much more to do here.” What is there to do in Ordos? “I hang out with my friends. We study at the library. We go to the mall.”
t-magazine,The mall, in this case, is a five-story building that looms over a parking lot in central Kangbashi. It is essentially a big food court, clustered around a central atrium, with dozens of small restaurants serving regional cuisines from all over China, as well as some Western fast food, like ice cream and pizza. That afternoon, the mall’s eateries were crammed. When the sun set, the action shifted to the parking lot, where groups gathered to socialize, and young men sold electronic dance music CDs out of car trunks ringed with LED lights. Later, many of the parking-lot revelers migrated to downtown Kangbashi’s signature evening entertainment: the “fountain show,” a synchronized display of gushing water, flashing lights and bombastic New Age music. It is billed as Asia’s largest such show, and it looks it: The dozens of geysers are arrayed in a vast reflecting pool that stretches the length of three football fields. IN SHORT, ORDOS is not empty, but it is odd: part windswept frontier outpost, part demented college town, with the vague mirage of another tacky desert colony, Las Vegas, shimmering in the strobe-lit mist of those fountains. It is unclear exactly how many people live in the city; the government is cagey about the question, and the figures they release are unreliable. But close observers of Ordos insist the numbers are on the rise. The filmmakers Adam Smith and Song Ting spent two years shooting “The Land of Many Palaces,” a feature documentary about Ordos and its citizens, which debuted in January. They contend that the population increased markedly during the years that they made the movie, between 2012-14, and estimate that about 100,000 currently live in the city.
t-magazine,That growth is due in large part to old-fashioned Chinese social engineering: an aggressive top-down effort to populate sparsely settled Kangbashi. In 2006, the headquarters of the local government was moved to Kangbashi from the Dongsheng District, 20 miles north; bus service between Kangbashi and Dongsheng was allegedly cut off so that Ordos’s public officials would be forced to take up residence in the new town. Some of the region’s best schools, including a high school, were also relocated to Kangbashi. Today, some vacant apartment buildings have become makeshift dormitories, home to teenage squatters whose parents couldn’t afford to move but wanted their children to attend the new district’s schools. On the north side of Kangbashi, the result of a different sort of social engineering can be seen. There, a population of largely middle-aged and elderly residents occupy a cluster of high-rise apartment towers that are arranged on a grid of hilly roads. The area is not genteel. There is little in the way of landscaping, and the few shops, set back from the streets in small strip malls, have a grubby, weather-beaten look. But the place does feel like a neighborhood. The residents sit outside the buildings, joking and gossiping. On the narrow sidewalks and in front of the shops, groups gather to play cards and mah-jongg.
t-magazine,These people are new citizens of Kangbashi, but they are not quite arrivistes. Nearly all are former farmers whose lands were purchased by the government, which persuaded them to move to apartment buildings in the new town. A half-century ago, in Mao’s Cultural Revolution, China exiled privileged urban youths “down to the countryside,” forcibly turning city dwellers into rustics. In Ordos today, peasants have been deployed to activate the city that has claimed their old pastoral homesteads. As you wander around Kangbashi, you catch the surreal flavor of these residents’ transformed lives. One day, I spent a few hours in a place called the Ordos Marriage Celebration Cultural Park — the kitschiest attraction in Kangbashi, which is no small distinction. Billed as “China’s first open topic park integrating culture, arts and recreation aimed to exhibit the ‘Ordos Marriage,’ ” it is a sprawling network of sculpture gardens devoted to the themes of romance and wedlock. Visitors can stroll through the Marriagable Age Square, Love Tree Square and the Chinese Traditional Love Culture Zone. There are gardens devoted to the Chinese and Western zodiacs; there are dozens of statues of hearts. Scattered throughout the garden are a series of grandiose tableaux depicting scenes from a courtship and wedding in the grasslands — hulking statues of Mongols and yurts and, of course, horses.
t-magazine,There are real-life horses in Marriage Celebration Cultural Park, too: a pair of them, hitched to carriages of the fancy old-fashioned gilded sort that the British royal family rides in parades. Visitors can hire the carriages for a romantic spin through the gardens. But on that day, there were no takers. The horses stood stone still in a circular path near the park entrance, looking rather less lively than their sculptural counterparts. Nearby, a half-dozen carriage drivers sat on benches. They were middle-aged men in their 40s and 50s. All of them were former farmers who now lived in apartment towers on the north side of Kangbashi. No one had shown up looking for a carriage ride that week, they told me. In fact, they’d had just a couple of customers in the past month. “It is the slow season,” said one of the drivers with a shrug. It didn’t matter much: With or without business, the government-run tourist office paid their salaries. Even in the “busy season,” they confessed, their eight-hour-long shifts were mostly spent sitting around and talking. Economists and urban planners remain divided about whether Ordos will ever populate sufficiently to feel like a “real city.” But the carriage drivers agreed: Urban living was good, and their lot now was far better than it had been when they tilled the hard Inner Mongolian earth. I asked the men where they had lived before moving to their apartments in Kangbashi. One of them, a 56-year-old man named Li Yonh Xiang, spoke up. “I lived here,” he said.
t-magazine,Li had been born and raised just steps from the bench where he was sitting. About half of the 90-acre park had belonged to his family; the government bought the land in 2000. “When we were peasants, we lived according to the weather,” Li said. “Now I live in a heated building with six floors. The city is very nice. There are many cars and buildings, but the air is very clean.” He said: “Sometimes I miss the old days — the farm, the nature. But it’s easy to picture it the way it was.” He pointed toward the horse-drawn carriages. “Our fields were here. We grew potatoes and corn and other things. Our house” — he nodded toward the park entrance, framed by a garish arch, studded with red and gold hearts — “was right there.” Is Ordos a ghost city? Not exactly. But for some, it’s a city of ghosts.
sports/soccer,What About Sepp Blatter? Questions About the FIFA Case - The New York Times The effort to round up all of the people indicted by the United States Justice Department proceeded Wednesday, a sprawling, international operation that is playing out in several soccer-mad countries. When will the accused appear in court in Brooklyn? Maybe not anytime soon. ■ The contours of the case became clearer when the indictment was unsealed Wednesday morning. Of the 12 illegal schemes described in the indictment, nine were sports marketing deals involving soccer tournaments. ■ UEFA, soccer’s governing body in Europe, on Wednesday called for FIFA to postpone its presidential election, scheduled for Friday. “UEFA believes that the FIFA congress should be postponed and that the election for the president should take place within six months,” the organization said in a statement. ■ Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice president who figures prominently in the United States prosecutors’ case, turned himself in to law enforcement officials in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The country set his bail at $2.5 million. His sons, Daryan and Daryll Warner, pleaded guilty in 2013. ■ Sepp Blatter, the longtime president of FIFA, released a statement Wednesday afternoon. “As unfortunate as these events are, it should be clear that we welcome the actions and the investigations by the U.S. and Swiss authorities and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football,” he said.
sports/soccer,■ Federal agents searched the Miami headquarters of Concacaf, the governing body for soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. ■ It will most likely be months before any of the foreign defendants appear in court in Brooklyn, unless they waive extradition. If they do not waive extradition, then prosecutors have 40 days to put together a formal extradition package; then extradition hearings would start. Jeffrey Webb: President of Concacaf, one of the six regional confederations that compose FIFA, and a vice president of FIFA Jack Warner: A former president of Concacaf and former vice president of FIFA Eugenio Figueredo: A former president of Conmebol, the South American federation, and an outgoing FIFA vice president Eduardo Li: President of the Costa Rican federation, set to join the FIFA executive committee this week Julio Rocha: President of the Nicaraguan association Costas Takkas: A former president of the Cayman Islands federation Rafael Esquivel: President of the Venezuelan association since 1988 José Maria Marin: A former president of Brazil’s federation Nicolás Leoz: A former president of Conmebol and former member of FIFA executive committee Alejandro Burzaco: An Argentine sports media executive Aaron Davidson: President of Traffic Sports USA, a promoter of soccer events, and chairman of the board of the North American Soccer League Hugo Jinkis: A soccer media executive Mariano Jinkis: A soccer media executive José Margulies: Charged as an intermediary who facilitated illegal payments
sports/soccer,Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA since 1998, was not charged, although the soccer officials who were indicted might present prosecutors with information damaging to Mr. Blatter. An election, seemingly preordained to give Mr. Blatter a fifth term as president, is scheduled for Friday in Zurich. It will go on as planned, a FIFA spokesman said. United States law gives the Justice Department wide authority to bring cases against foreign nationals living abroad, an authority that prosecutors have used repeatedly in international terrorism cases. Those cases can hinge on the slightest connection to the United States, like the use of an American bank or Internet service provider. Switzerland’s treaty with the United States is unusual in that it gives Swiss authorities the power to refuse extradition for tax crimes, but on matters of general criminal law, the Swiss have agreed to turn over people for prosecution in American courts. There has been a cultural shift in recent years: Switzerland has gradually, if not reluctantly, become more cooperative with foreign authorities as its companies and large banking sector seek to expand and flourish abroad, in particular in the United States. In 2009, UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, agreed to hand over the names of 4,450 of its clients to American judicial authorities, as well as pay a fine of $780 million for facilitating tax evasion. American law enforcement officials have since charged dozens of Swiss bankers and financial advisers with facilitating tax evasion.
sports/soccer,Switzerland has also extradited some people wanted for financial fraud by countries like Russia despite criticism from human rights groups that were concerned that the people would not receive a fair trial in their homelands. ■ The extradition process begins in Switzerland. In a statement released Wednesday morning, Switzerland’s Federal Office of Justice explained its protocols: “A simplified procedure will apply for wanted persons who agree to their immediate extradition. The F.O.J. can immediately approve their extradition to the U.S. and order its execution. However, if a wanted person opposes their extradition, the F.O.J. will invite the U.S. to submit a formal extradition request within the deadline of 40 days specified in the bilateral extradition treaty.” ■ FIFA’s presidential election is scheduled for Friday in Zurich.
nyregion,35 New York City Parks to Get Makeovers - The New York Times At Bowne Playground in Queens, Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce on Tuesday an ambitious initiative that would channel some $130 million into tattered parks and playgrounds in low-income neighborhoods across New York City, according to several people briefed on the plan. Many people could not find them on a map: Ranaqua Park in Mott Haven in the Bronx. Saratoga Ballfields in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Luther Gulick Park on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. They are the hardscrabble neighborhood parks that, advocates say, were overlooked during the Bloomberg administration, even as billions of dollars flowed to big-ticket legacy projects in wealthier parts of the city. The parks equity plan comes after months of wrangling over how to finance the initiative. During his campaign, Mr. de Blasio endorsed a plan to force the private groups that raise money for the city’s richest parks to hand over as much as a fifth of their budgets to needier parks. But as with the living wage law signed last week, and his push for universal prekindergarten classes, Mr. de Blasio chose to compromise on the methodology in order to achieve the core of his goals. The park plan relies on public funding, not private dollars, in its quest to address the disparities in the city’s vast park system.
nyregion,Under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the city committed $6 billion to capital projects in the parks, but they tended to be highly visible projects like the High Line in Chelsea; Brooklyn Bridge Park, along the East River waterfront; or Governors Island. He also poured hundreds of millions of dollars into several park projects in more modest communities, including the revival of the long-shuttered McCarren Pool on the Greenpoint-Williamsburg border in Brooklyn. Often left behind, however, were the half-acre parks and playgrounds sandwiched between tenements. Under Mr. de Blasio’s plan, 35 of those parks will share the $130 million infusion, plus additional money for maintenance. The parks are all heavily used open spaces in poor neighborhoods that struggle with high obesity and asthma rates. The parks on the list have had little to no investment in recent years. Mark D. Levine, a city councilman from Upper Manhattan who is chairman of the parks committee, praised the plan, particularly its use of public funds. Requiring the largest conservancies to give a portion of their budgets to neighborhood parks, he said, would have yielded $15 million at most. Conservancy leaders had said that it could scare off donors and force staff layoffs. The money, Mr. Levine acknowledged, “is not enough to touch every park in the system, but it will have a transformative impact on these parks.” Mr. Levine added, “It largely answers the question of whether we’ll solve the equity problem through public investment or taking money from the conservancies.”
nyregion,But to put the figures in perspective, the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit group that runs the city’s flagship park, received a single $100 million gift in October 2012 from the hedge fund manager John A. Paulson; it spends $44 million annually to help operate the park. At the same time, the percentage of the city’s budget going to parks has dropped, according to Mr. Levine. Parks spending made up 0.52 percent of city spending in 2000, down from 0.86 percent in the 1980s and 1.5 percent in the 1960s. Parks spending for the current fiscal year was budgeted at about $950 million. But the parks department does not control how all of that money is spent. Instead, the choice of what capital projects to fund often is made by City Council members and borough presidents. If the local City Council members put their discretionary money elsewhere, parks in their districts are left to deteriorate. Of the $130 million, $80 million represents an increase to the parks capital budget. It was proposed by Mr. Bloomberg in his final budget plan. Mr. de Blasio added $50 million. State Senator Daniel L. Squadron has been a proponent of having conservancies share their wealth. He sponsored a bill requiring conservancies with operating budgets of $5 million or more to dedicate 20 percent to neighborhood parks. Only a handful of conservancies are that well-endowed.
nyregion,While Mr. de Blasio had embraced Mr. Squadron’s proposal during the campaign, he seemed to back off when he announced his new parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, last spring. At a news conference, Mr. de Blasio called the Albany bill “creative” and “productive,” but stopped short of endorsing it. Still, on Monday, conservancies and representatives from City Hall were continuing to discuss their role, which could include fund-raising on behalf of struggling parks or helping with maintenance. Mr. Squadron said that he was not disappointed by the lack of a financial commitment from the conservancies. His legislation, he said, helped start a conversation about park equity. “A year and a half ago, folks were not talking about parks equity and now the mayor is addressing the biggest inequities in the system,” Mr. Squadron said. “Having the conservancies at the table beyond this step is a critical piece of the long-term picture.” Ranaqua Park, a tiny patch of grass with a playground and basketball court in the South Bronx, made the cut for the park-equity plan and stands to reap more than $3 million in capital money. On a recent weekday, residents said that money could correct the uneven surfacing on the playground and smooth out the court. It might also pay for landscaping for the patchy lawn. The idea got Benjamin Rosa, 15, who lives a block from the park, dreaming: “We could have new sprinklers, and maybe two basketball courts instead of one,” he said.
arts/music,Jeremih’s ‘Late Nights’ Receives Less Fanfare Than He’d Expected From Def Jam - The New York Times In the five years since Jeremih last put out an album, his slinky voice has been everywhere. A radio fixture since his debut in 2009, the Chicago R&B singer has had four Top 10 Billboard hits, including the platinum-selling “Don’t Tell Em,” which in June 2014 became the first official release from his new album and peaked that fall at No. 6. But “Late Nights: The Album” didn’t come out then. Or this summer. No fewer than six potential release dates were floated in the music press. Each came and went without a record. It’s strange then, or strangely fitting, that when “Late Nights” was finally released on Friday via Def Jam, it came without warning — a welcome surprise for hungry fans, sure, but also a crash landing for a long-planned project. Not quite a secret drop, à la Beyoncé, because of years of false starts and a slew of advance singles, “Late Nights” received the “perfect ghetto rollout,” Jeremih said the next day with a mix of resignation and good humor. “You’re talking about somebody that ain’t got no videos for any of my platinum singles,” he said of the lack of promotion. “You can’t ride around New York and see my face on a poster, and my album’s out. “Truth is, I know people are responsible to do that,” he continued. “The label is responsible to do that.”
arts/music,Late Saturday night, at a show celebrating the album’s release at S.O.B.’s in Manhattan, Jeremih had a surrogate in 50 Cent, the rap superstar turned industry ombudsman. Taking the stage as a hypeman alongside Jeremih, the rapper carried on about the young singer’s obvious talent. “Def Jam wasn’t sure,” he said. “Then they got with it.” The next morning, though, 50 Cent doubled down. “What Def Jam has done to Jeremih is so foul,” he wrote on Instagram and Twitter. “They have dropped the ball in so many ways.” Jeremih retweeted the mini-rant with added commentary: “Sabotage City.” Yet on Saturday, Jeremih, 28, had not been content to only point fingers, citing his own personal challenges and business naïveté for the delays. “I’m a child to the game still — I have a lot more to learn,” he said, referring to fatherhood and changes in management. “But I do know that certain things are necessary and should be handled right now. And they’re not.” Faisel Durrani, an executive vice president and the general manager at the label, said in a statement on Monday that Def Jam was “elated to release ‘Late Nights.’” He added, “The release strategy — developed in lock step with Jeremih and his management team — has been a surprise delivery of the album that allows for an unveiling and for future discovery.”
arts/music,Adding to the exasperation of Jeremih’s supporters is that the typical unspoken reasons for major-label delays — a lack of buzz, flopping songs — did not afflict the man born Jeremih Felton on Chicago’s South Side: He is a proven singles artist, both lead and featured, with the buoyant “Planes,” a January release since retitled “Planez,” also reaching platinum status and earning a Grammy nomination on Monday for best R&B performance. (His biggest hit of 2015 is a guest spot on “Somebody,” Natalie La Rose’s song invoking Whitney Houston, which reached No. 10.) Acknowledging his own chart success, Jeremih seemed legitimately bewildered by his place in the music ecosystem. The store he visited to see the finished product had stocked only seven copies, he said, and they were overpriced. “I could only imagine if I had the support that I see my peers have,” he said. “Even to go to the store and see that the album was 20 bucks was like, damn,” he added, rounding up. “It’s $18.99! Rihanna, Beyoncé, Kanye’s albums would never be $18.99.” Industry frustrations aside, the mood was celebratory among Jeremih’s tight-knit crew members, who arrived in New York from Chicago on Saturday for a night of back-to-back performances. The group rented a $3,750-a-night multilevel Airbnb penthouse in SoHo, complete with a hot tub in the master bedroom, while filling the place with soul food and shopping bags from Barneys and Saks Fifth Avenue. “Late Nights: The Album,” the only appropriate soundtrack, blasted from upstairs.
arts/music,“I’m just glad it’s out,” Jeremih said during a van ride to his first appearance, a Hot 97 holiday concert on Saturday at the Prudential Center in Newark that featured some of hip-hop’s biggest names. “I feel like it’s a huge burden off my shoulders.” Alluding to his contract, he added, “I had an obligation with Def Jam to turn in one more.” “Late Nights: The Album” bears no signs of behind-the-scenes turbulence. Conceived as the spiritual follow-up to his mold-breaking self-released 2012 mixtape, “Late Nights With Jeremih,” the album is gleefully debaucherous, with a hip-hop edge in place of any R&B sappiness. Jeremih — self-taught as a pianist and drummer and never trained as a vocalist — uses melody in rhythmic bursts, turning his naturally thin voice, underdeveloped on the appealing but generic early hits “Birthday Sex” and “Down on Me,” into an airy, dexterous instrument. Favoring warm production with snaps and empty space, Jeremih finds pockets in a beat as a rapper might, but also has a sweet falsetto. “I’m a percussionist, so that’s most of what I know when I attack a record,” he said. “Melodically, knowing the keys — my first love — that makes the perfect blend.” The producer Mick Schultz, an early collaborator who has worked on Jeremih’s biggest singles, said of the album: “There were a lot of back-and-forth issues getting it out,” but added, “Jeremih always seemed to channel his energy back into the music, which is why you kept hearing him on features and constantly on the radio, even without his own project out.”
arts/music,More than serviceable as a radio hook man, Jeremih raised expectations for himself with intimate, cohesive projects like the “Late Nights” mixtape and his subsequent work with the more alternative electronic producer Shlohmo. Like those Internet-based projects, Jeremih said he expected the new album to spread via word of mouth. “Hopefully it’ll be a forest fire,” he said. The simmering label drama may not hurt in the attention department. Jeremih previously lashed out, earning plenty of blog headlines, late last year on a one-off track: “Would I have signed to Def Jam if I knew they was deaf?” he asked with more aggression than usual. “Nah.” His aim now is to make his name as well known as the sound of his voice. “That’s my ultimate goal: to get people to say my name right,” said Jeremih (pronounced JAIR-uh-my). “They’re still saying it wrong.” That goes for some of his peers, too: Not long after receiving a congratulatory embrace backstage from the hip-hop godfather Puff Daddy, the night’s M.C., Busta Rhymes, introduced the singer to the Hot 97 crowd as “Jeremiah.” (The rapper 2 Chainz made the same mistake.) Visibly irritated after his appearance, Jeremih could only fume briefly on the drive back to Manhattan for his second show. “On to the next one,” he said.
arts/music,Taking the stage at S.O.B.’s directly from the van after a rallying shot of Patrón, his mood seemed lifted by the show of support, including the 50 Cent cameo, at his headlining event. By the end Jeremih was giddy, filling the stage with his friends and collaborators for the new marijuana anthem “Pass Dat.” The team sang and bounded in unison as if the track were an old favorite — to them, maybe it was. Now, at least, everyone else could learn the words.

arts/television,The Most Riveting Host in Late Night (and the Most Overlooked) - The New York Times In September, Tom Cruise stepped into a car with Conan O’Brien and, with his characteristic exuberance, exclaimed that he was ready to sing karaoke or talk comedy. Mr. O’Brien waved away those ideas. “My thing, Tom, is take it back to basics,” he said, before describing his plan: “Two guys, just driving.” What followed was not a spoof of James Corden’s signature “Carpool Karaoke” but something delightfully weirder than that. This 11-minute video began as cringe-comedy performance art, with Mr. Cruise bored and baffled, and Mr. O’Brien, quietly driving, as a hostile, frighteningly intense version of himself. Then the narrative turned into a kind of thriller as the hero, Mr. Cruise, in his best comic role since “Tropic Thunder,” slowly realized he was trapped with a maniac and needed to take desperate measures. It was the funniest bit on late night I had seen all year. Among the scrum of late-night hosts, Conan O’Brien — who is set to shoot his TBS show, “Conan,” at the Apollo Theater beginning Monday as part of the New York Comedy Festival — is not earning the highest ratings or generating the most talk. But his show has become more distinctive than ever, doubling down on comedy for comedy’s sake. Now that New York magazine has called Jimmy Kimmel the new Walter Cronkite, and Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert pursue viral moments with games or political diatribes, Conan O’Brien suddenly seems like not only the sole host in the time slot truly desperate to make you laugh, but also the most willing to take artistic risks.
arts/television,Maybe he really is just going back to basics. It’s easy to take Mr. O’Brien’s gift for refined silliness for granted, since he has been doing the job for nearly a quarter century. His show still looks a bit like what Johnny Carson did for decades: emerge from a curtain to big applause, deliver a topical monologue, then move to a desk, banter with a sidekick, do a comedy bit and talk to guests. Instead of shying from appearing old-fashioned, Mr. O’Brien now uses that image, poking fun at himself, which was part of the joke of the Tom Cruise bit, but also earnestly embracing his status as the éminence grise of late night. When his sidekick, Andy Richter, ad-libbed a line a few weeks ago that referenced Jack Benny, Mr. O’Brien laughed, adding, “Could you send everyone a letter telling them who that is?” After a break, he brought up Benny again, recommending him to the audience, surely the only plug that this comedy legend has received on late night in a long while. In his first years on TBS, Mr. O’Brien still seemed haunted by losing “The Tonight Show,” but his series now has the pleasing eccentricity of someone who doesn’t care about ratings or expectations.
arts/television,In the past two weeks, he has brought on weirdo characters like Butterscotch, part of a long tradition of creepy clowns, and a guy doing a Dracula impression who can’t stop making bad puns (“I don’t want to sound like your mummy but …”), a bit that spun out unexpectedly into a story of addiction that led this bad joker to attend the Lestat Institute for Word Therapy. The fake institute, complete with serious-looking people in white lab coats, evoked Albert Brooks’s classic sendups of the conventions of comedy. Just because the premises of these sketches are tethered to a tradition doesn’t mean they aren’t peculiar. Mr. O’Brien’s brand of silliness has always been delightfully, often gruesomely askew. Recently, he began a sketch by asking strangers what they thought about the news that Sears would no longer be carrying Whirlpool appliances. But this man-on-the-street premise was only the setup, because after a few people expressed normal curiosity or indifference, one man appeared stunned, immediately called his family, went home and buried himself alive while they watched. The video ended in another interview with a person showing mild interest in the news, but in the background, the family looked down on the grave and set it aflame. While some jokes are connected to the calendar, like the clown for Halloween, many of them are evergreen. A punch line about the daily goings-on in Washington can get easy laughs from like-minded viewers. But they won’t age well, and Mr. O’Brien, generally speaking, aims for jokes that depend less on the news cycle than his competitors do.
arts/television,This even extends to how Mr. O’Brien handles politics. While he does an ordinary joke or two about President Trump every night, he also produced one of the most truly daring episodes of political comedy this year, with a September show shot entirely in Israel and the Palestinian territories, one of his many episode-long forays into other cities. Mr. O’Brien floated in the Dead Sea, engaged in some terrible haggling with street vendors and delivered a minute-long history of the area that covered thousands of years. Much of the special was simply Mr. O’Brien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene. But he didn’t only stay light. When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler. He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment  online. Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks. Earlier this year, there were rumors that “Conan” was shifting to a weekly format, and Lord knows, after being a daily talk-show host since 1993, he has earned the right to a slower schedule. But here’s hoping he sticks around, because more than anyone else on air, he is a reminder that talk-show hosting is an art form deserving respect. The increasing politicization of late-night comedy has been great for ratings, and has helped certain hosts find their voices, but it’s worth examining if it comes at a cost. Comedy doesn’t need to serve a political end to be important.
fashion/mens-style,At Lanvin, a Lot More Than ‘Nothing’ - The New York Times PARIS — As a team, as a cause, as an ideal, it’s hard to root for “nothing.” Yet there was the first model out on the Lanvin runway this sunny Sunday morning, tied in a scarf that said just that. “Nothing,” it blared, where you’d expect a logo or a team, or at the very least a college stripe. Instead, it was nothing. That, actually, was something. It might have been mere high-priced nihilism, but Lucas Ossendrijver, Lanvin’s long time men’s wear designer, is more resilient than that, even when his collections seem to suggest troubling times or troubled men. “There is nothing,” Mr. Ossendrijver said after the show, “‘nothing’ meaning no collaboration, no prints, no art, no decoration. I took things from everyday life, things that everybody knows — the check shirt, the chino, the parka, the coat — and I set myself a challenge how to elevate them. The job of the designer is to elevate everyday life. To not just be real, but more than real.” Many designers have fallen back on the “real,” this season, emphasizing practicality, duly practicing restraint. (In Milan, my colleague Guy Trebay wrote about “pragmatic designs for uncertain times.”) That strategy can be a welcome retreat from fashion-runway fantasy to real clothes, but it can also leave you wilting before a mass of gormless normcore. Why schlep to Milan and Paris for that?
fashion/mens-style,Mr. Ossendrijver gave a good reason. His fall 2017 Lanvin pieces were recognizable workhorses, reworked into newer, stranger versions of themselves. “I find it a bit worrying that everything has to be normal,” he said. “In fashion, we have to go further than that.” He has an engineer’s interest in how the cut of a cloth, the boning under a jacket shoulder or the heat of a press can reshape a finished garment; he has spent more than 10 years in Lanvin’s labs and still is ready to rhapsodize about the mechanics at the slightest provocation. That may be more than a customer wants to know. It is enough to see that, on the body, his coat wraps around its wearer with an appealing roundness, that his jacket sleeves have a bit more muscle in their stiffness. There are pieces here that will go further than many men may care to — cropped sweaters inching ever higher over dad-plaid shirts, say. But Mr. Ossendrijver called it his duty to go further. On the back of one jacket he printed the words “Fantastic Utopia” — the furthest reach of the idealized real. And beside it, he showed plenty of others, particularly outerwear pieces like hooded overcoats and shearling-paneled anoraks, that go just far enough. So nothing wasn’t nothing, really, and thankfully not. Spend a month seeing enough “basics” on enough runways and it can begin to feel like watching grass grow. Then there is Mr. Ossendrijver, who scored his show with “Mother Earth’s Plantasia,” Moog music by Mort Garson, the electronic-music maestro: a ’70s oddity composed to get your houseplants grooving.
business,Want Change? Shareholders Have a Tool for That - The New York Times Are you an investor who usually junks the voluminous corporate proxy statements that arrive each spring, declining to take part in director elections and other governance matters because you think your vote won’t count? If so, you are not alone. With millions of shares outstanding at large companies, it’s hard to believe that an individual investor’s vote can make a difference. But the stakes are higher this year. If, for example, you’re concerned about the Trump administration’s plans to roll back regulations throughout corporate America, you may want to take a more active approach to proxy voting. Say that the new leaders at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency relax their agencies’ oversight, as anticipated. That would mean shareholder votes in favor of holding executives accountable on executive pay, climate change issues and other governance matters are especially important. “There’s never been a better time to address these issues, whether as an institutional investor or an individual,” said Nell Minow, vice chairwoman at ValueEdge Advisors, a firm that guides institutional shareholders on how to reduce risk in their portfolios. “If you are worried that your company is lobbying to weaken environmental rules, for example, then it’s really a fabulous opportunity for you to join in with the institutions and other economic forces making it clear to companies that they can’t get away with it.”
business,As was the case last year, the topic of climate change will again appear on shareholder proxies this year. One proposal that gained a lot of traction among investors in 2016 asked energy companies to publish an analysis of how their holdings would be affected in the long term by measures limiting the global increase in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius — a goal agreed to by nations in the 2015 Paris accord. That kind of analysis may force a company to alert shareholders that its assets would not be worth as much under those conditions. (BHP Billiton, the Australia-based mining giant, undertook such a study in 2015 and concluded that while its asset value would be affected, it would continue to create value for shareholders.) Management at the companies whose proxies included these proposals generally urged investors to vote against them. Still, they received substantial support at some companies — 38.1 percent of votes cast at Exxon Mobil favored the proposals, as did 40.8 percent at Chevron, and almost half the votes at Occidental Petroleum. None of these companies have published a proxy statement yet, but similar proposals are likely again this year at those and other energy companies, governance experts said. Fresh support from investors could put the proposals over the top.
business,Shareholders should realize that they can no longer rely on the government to urge companies to recognize the risks that climate change poses to their operations. That is the view of Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project, a nonprofit organization that helps institutional investors work with corporate boards on climate change issues. “Investors have to become more involved to exercise their collective power as owners of these corporations so that they run their businesses in the best long-term economic interests,” he said in a telephone interview. Of course, shareholder proposals are typically not binding, so companies are not required to abide by them. Still, managers are usually loath to ignore the wishes of a majority of their shareholders. Individual investors can effect change this year on another topic: company policies governing when it should act to recover an executive’s compensation because of corporate wrongdoing. The idea of recouping executive pay took hold in the early 2000s after the Enron and WorldCom accounting fiascos. The Sarbanes-Oxley law of 2002 gave the S.E.C. the ability to go after incentive pay earned improperly by an executive in connection with an accounting irregularity. Actual clawbacks have been few, however. So the Dodd-Frank legislation of 2010 required the S.E.C. to write new rules expanding the potential for recoveries. In July 2015, the S.E.C. proposed a rule requiring companies to adopt clawback policies on executive compensation. But it did not go into effect before the Trump administration took over. That rule is probably dead. Nevertheless, shareholders may be able to improve clawback policies at two big companies this year: Verizon and Caterpillar.
business,“The whole concept of executive compensation is pay for performance,” said Cornish F. Hitchcock, a lawyer in Washington who is advising the group of Verizon shareholders proposing the policy change at the company. “If executives’ behavior costs the company money or damages its reputation, shouldn’t there be consequences?” The Verizon shareholders agitating for change are a group of 205,000 former telecom employees known as the Association of BellTel Retirees. Since 1997, 10 proposals put forward by the retirees have been voted on by Verizon shareholders; in eight of the measures, the company responded by changing its policies, according to the retirees’ website. This year, the retirees’ organization wants the company to expand its clawback policy; Verizon’s current policy limits pay recoveries to executives who engaged in “willful misconduct” that causes significant financial or reputational harm to the company. Far too narrow, the retirees say. First of all, the term “willful misconduct” is ill defined, Mr. Hitchcock said, and may limit pay recoveries to egregious cases only. In addition, Verizon’s policy should also cover wrongdoing that arose because of negligence or a supervisory failure. Verizon is urging its shareholders to vote against the retirees’ proposal at the annual meeting in early May. James Gerace, a Verizon spokesman, explained why in a phone interview. “Negligence could be really broad and open to interpretation,” he said. “We were trying not to make it so broadly applicable that it was going to paralyze our people in making decisions.”
business,In their proposal, the retirees detailed why Verizon’s current policy is problematic, citing a 2015 regulatory settlement Verizon struck with the Federal Communications Commission. The agency contended that Verizon placed unauthorized third-party charges on customers’ cellular phone bills; the company paid $90 million to settle the matter. Under the policy, it’s unclear whether the company scrutinized the actions of any executives relating to this settlement, the retirees’ proposal said. So they urged Verizon to change its policy so that it must disclose details of any clawbacks to shareholders as well as decisions not to pursue recoveries. Shareholders of Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment maker whose offshore tax practices are under investigation by federal authorities, will vote on clawbacks this year. Tejal Patel, corporate governance director at Change to Win Investment Group, said her group put forward a shareholder proposal on clawbacks for this year’s annual meeting. “If something goes wrong,” she said, “you want executives to be held accountable and know what the company is doing about it.” A Caterpillar spokeswoman confirmed that the proposal would be on the proxy this year. Of course, many individual investors — those who own shares in mutual funds — can’t speak their minds through proxy votes. Their funds vote their shares for them and all too often follow corporate boards’ recommendations to reject shareholder proposals. If you own shares in a mutual fund and feel strongly about these issues, write to the fund’s executives and tell them how you want them to vote your shares. They may not do as you say, but at least they’ll know where you stand.
business/media,Sumner Redstone’s Granddaughter Sides With Viacom Directors - The New York Times The battle that is splitting Sumner M. Redstone’s $40 billion media empire is further dividing his family as well: His granddaughter Keryn Redstone is siding with Viacom’s directors, who are challenging his competence and asserting that he was manipulated by his daughter, Shari Redstone. In a statement released Wednesday, Keryn Redstone said she was planning legal action to join with Viacom directors in a “common cause to liberate my grandfather from Shari’s clutches and protect my fellow trust beneficiaries and myself from her machinations.” Keryn Redstone, 34, said that her grandfather, who is 93 and in poor health, had been incompetent since October and that she had been restricted from seeing him since Valentine’s Day, when he “sat there lifeless and flanked by nurses and caretakers.” She took direct aim at her aunt, asserting that Shari Redstone and her family “have managed to totally isolate and effectively kidnap, brainwash and take advantage of my grandfather due to his debilitated state of mind and frail health.” She said Shari Redstone and her three adult children had “succeeded in reversing decades of my grandfather’s careful estate planning and are poised to seize control of Viacom and CBS.” “I do not intend to let Shari get away with this outrage,” Keryn Redstone said in the statement. Representatives of Mr. Redstone and Shari Redstone did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Viacom spokesman declined to comment.
business/media,Feuding has long been a part of the Redstone family history. Keryn Redstone is the daughter of Brent Redstone, Sumner’s estranged son. Brent Redstone sued Mr. Redstone in 2006, asserting that his father had favored his sister and frozen him out of the family business. They settled the year after, when Brent Redstone’s share of the business was bought out. Since then, he has avoided the public spotlight. This is the second time this year that Keryn Redstone has stood in opposition to her aunt. In April, she filed a petition to join Manuela Herzer, a former companion and onetime romantic partner of Mr. Redstone, in Ms. Herzer’s suit challenging the media mogul’s mental competency. While the judge overseeing the case rejected Keryn Redstone’s petition, she was scheduled to appear as a witness in the trial before it was dismissed. Keryn Redstone’s announcement Wednesday that she had aligned with Viacom directors added yet another plotline to the ferocious battle for power engulfing Mr. Redstone’s business empire. Through the private theater chain company National Amusements, Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting stock in Viacom and CBS, two of the world’s largest entertainment companies. That control will pass to an irrevocable trust after Mr. Redstone dies or is declared incompetent. Mr. Redstone recently ousted Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s chairman and chief executive, and George Abrams, a Viacom director, from the trust that will control his companies; both were longtime confidants. Those dismissals are now at the center of legal battles in Massachusetts and California.
business/media,At stake for Keryn Redstone in the court fights is the future of her inheritance. She and Mr. Redstone’s other grandchildren are the beneficiaries of the trust; as such, they are named as nominal defendants in the Massachusetts suit that challenges the changes to the trust. What specific legal action Keryn Redstone plans is unclear. She could side with Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams in their Massachusetts suit; contest Mr. Redstone’s petition in Los Angeles; or take legal action of her own. Keryn Redstone has hired Pierce O’Donnell, the same lawyer who represents Ms. Herzer. Ms. Herzer is appealing the judge’s decision last month to dismiss her case and has filed a separate $100 million suit against Shari Redstone for portraying her as the center of a network of people who manipulated and abused Mr. Redstone.
us,Health Exchange Enrollment Jumps, Even as G.O.P. Pledges Repeal - The New York Times WASHINGTON — About 6.4 million people have signed up for health insurance next year under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration said Wednesday, as people rushed to purchase plans regardless of Republican promises that the law will be repealed within months. The new sign-ups — an increase of 400,000 over a similar point last year — mean the health care coverage of millions of consumers could be imperiled by one of the first legislative actions of Donald J. Trump’s presidency. Hundreds of thousands of other people who took no action will be automatically re-enrolled by the federal government in the same or similar plans, officials said, and their coverage could be threatened as well. Consumers still have until the end of January to enroll. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said the number of sign-ups was remarkable in view of “headwinds” created by premium increases for 2017 and by the uncertainty of the entire health law after Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Americans remain divided over President Obama’s most significant legislative achievement, even as 20 million people have gained coverage under the law and the percentage of those without insurance has dropped to record lows. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders of the House and the Senate have vowed to repeal the 2010 law as one of the first legislative actions of the Trump era.
us,To lay the political groundwork, Republicans have portrayed the law as collapsing under its own weight, unable to hold down health costs or provide the insurance choices its advocates promised. But the 6.4 million signing up on HealthCare.gov through Monday could undermine the argument that the law is in free fall. The five states with the most people enrolling for coverage on the site through Monday were Florida, with 1.3 million plan selections, Texas (776,000), North Carolina (369,000), Georgia (352,000) and Pennsylvania (291,000). Mr. Trump carried all those states. And the 6.4 million figure does not include data from states like New York and California that use their own digital marketplaces. Democrats say that repealing the law will cause chaos and catastrophe, jeopardizing coverage for people who use HealthCare.gov and millions more who have been able to enroll in Medicaid. Whether those consumers like their coverage enough to fight for it and to resist Republican efforts to undo the law is unclear. But the enrollment figures will provide a rallying cry for Democrats intent on saving it. “Enrollment is running ahead of last year,” Ms. Burwell said. “Today’s enrollment numbers confirm that doomsday predictions about the marketplace are wrong.” For their part, Republicans reiterated their concerns. “This disaster of a law has led to massive premium spikes, less choice for patients and a collapse of the exchange markets, and no amount of spinning from the White House can hide this ugly reality,” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said Wednesday.
us,The Trump team tried to allay concerns by promising a smooth transition to a new version of health care coverage, echoing congressional Republicans, who have floated the idea of quickly repealing the law and then delaying the effective date for several years as they try to agree on a different approach to the nation’s health care problems. “The enrollment numbers announced today show just how important health care coverage is to millions of Americans,” said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team. “The Trump administration will work closely with Congress, governors, patients, doctors and other stakeholders to fix the Affordable Care Act’s well-documented flaws and provide consumers with stable and predictable health plan choices.” A number of Republican governors, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence of Indiana, supported the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and some have expressed reservations about Republican plans to repeal that part of the law. Some Republican senators have expressed similar reservations. Thomas P. Miller, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute and a harsh critic of the health law, predicted that the new numbers would have “a negligible effect” on the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. “The Obama administration gets an A for effort in marketing puffery,” he said, “but remains stuck with a C for execution.” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, was similarly unimpressed. “Initial enrollment numbers for the health law have long been flawed, as they do not account for consumers who actually follow through and pay the premiums,” he said. “A closer look will be needed down the road to determine the final, real enrollment numbers.”
us,But consumers are becoming concerned, administration officials say. Ms. Burwell said the federal call center had “heard from more than 30,000 people worrying about the future of their coverage in the wake of the election, and wondering whether they should still sign up for a 2017 plan.” The answer, she said, is a definite yes. Some people might have been rushing to sign up because they were concerned about losing coverage they had gained under the health law, acknowledged Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A larger factor, he said, is that people need coverage and are finding it affordable. Most consumers shopping in the public marketplace can find coverage for less than $75 a month after receiving subsidies, the administration said. But to find such bargains, consumers may have to switch plans and change doctors, officials said. Last Thursday alone, Ms. Burwell said, 670,000 people enrolled, setting a record. Monday was the deadline for people to sign up for coverage starting Jan. 1. The open enrollment period, which began on Nov. 1, ends on Jan. 31, 11 days after Mr. Trump takes office. The Obama administration predicted in October that 13.8 million people would sign up for coverage or be automatically re-enrolled through the federal and state marketplaces by the end of January, and Ms. Burwell said Wednesday that she stood by that prediction. In the past week, Obama administration officials have tried to lock in place their health policies by issuing a batch of final rules before Mr. Trump takes office.
us,One rule, the annual “notice of benefit and payment parameters,” includes detailed standards for plan benefits, eligibility and enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. Most of the new standards apply to insurance sold in 2018. Some apply to 2019, a sign that the administration hopes the law will still be in place well into the Trump administration.
politics,THE INAUGURATION: INAUGURAL DIARY; Great Political Theater With a Touch of Pomp - The New York Times The sense that American political life resembles a Robert Altman movie has rarely been more vivid than during the parade celebrating George W. Bush's inauguration. In the glare of television lights, the blue and white presidential reviewing stand looked as insubstantial as a stage set. The leader of the free world, his family and company saluted and waved from behind a barrier of bulletproof plastic, looking tiny as toys. The weather was no help. A frigid rain that scoured the streets also kept the V.I.P. bleachers along Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House from filling up. Viewers along the entire parade route in some place were so sparse that what was meant to be the mother of all celebrations occasionally took on the rinky-dink aspect of a Miss Firecracker contest. This might have been tough on the 10,000 marchers, who had waited hours in the rain for the swearing in and the first presidential lunch to conclude. But it made for great absurdist theater, in the Altman mold. There were hula troupes, floats with waterfalls and Styrofoam bison, groups who had been chosen to be there for their ''extensive pompom dance performance quality.''
politics,Up at the lead of the parade's first flank, Division One, were members of the Kilgore Rangerettes. This 60-year-old Texas dance troupe is known for its crowd-pleasing high kicks, its pieplate hats, and its signature buttocks-grazing skirts. Waiting for things to start, one Rangerette wrapped herself in a flag-striped pullover and shivered. ''I'm so totally freezing to death'' she complained. ''But I'm still very glad I voted for Mr. Bush,'' she said, ''so he could get elected and we could be here now.'' Sharing a Dress Designer ''It's a real synergy,'' said Kelli Finglass, the director of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. ''We go by 'America's sweetheart' and now she's America's new sweetheart, so we're really proud to be sharing a designer with her.'' Ms. Finglass was referring to Michael Faircloth -- a dressmaker from Yoakum, Tex., who leaped from obscurity when it was announced that he would design the inauguration gown for Laura Bush. The dress itself, a form-fitting, scoop-neck gown with red Chantilly lace, re-embroidered with Austrian crystals, was chosen by Mrs. Bush for the evening of her husband's inauguration. The gown was a bit more discreet than Mr. Faircloth's other recent commission, the navy blue bodysuit with a plunging V-neck and belts adorned with sterling Western buckles that the Cheerleaders wear at Cowboys games. Although Seventh Avenue reacted to Mrs. Bush's selection with on-the-record tact and private incredulity, there were reasons besides Texas chauvinism behind it.
politics,The demands on a dress that can stand up to a marathon night of balls, private wingdings and microscopic public scrutiny are not so different from those on a costume good for doing high kicks during halftime. Costumes worn by people who perform in public the way cheerleaders and first ladies do have to make a ''clear visual impression,'' Ms. Finglass said. They must have ''danceability and wear.'' Most of all, she continued, they have to read from a distance in a way that ''will clearly symbolize the brand.'' The Right Style for Dancing The dress worked. The color suited Mrs. Bush's Snow White complexion. The shape flattered what Mr. Faircloth called her ''hourglass figure.'' The vivid color was mediagenic, read well from a distance, and stood up to the rigors of eight official and one runover balls. (As many as 50,000 people were said to be celebrating last night.) More to the point, perhaps, it was the right dress for dancing with a partner who has two left feet. It is well known by now that George W. Bush can't dance. He said so himself. At the Texas Wyoming ball, the president appeared just after 10 o'clock, ran through what threatens to become his set piece about Washington as a temporary home and then took to the floor with his wife. First, he told an audience so thickly clustered that the stage front looked like a mosh pit, that he planned to break the 30-second limit that for dancing with his wife set first at the Texas gubernatorial ball. But what's the point? Taking his wife's hand with the grace of someone learning to fly fish, Mr. Bush seesawed her around the stage a bit, then pulled back and looked at his watch. They'd gone 28 seconds, more than enough.
politics,Moving to the Big Leagues Even before Mrs. Bush had set foot in the White House, a certain repositioning of brand had apparently begun. She slipped off the mask of dutiful, neutral spouse and mother when she told NBC's ''Today'' show that she thought Roe v. Wade should not be overturned, diverging from the message of her husband's campaign platform. Perhaps, said some worried guests at a cocktail party for Team 100, the elite Republican donor group, Mrs. Bush has a role in mind more influential than first librarian. ''She should stick to books,'' said one guest at a cocktail party preceding a black-tie dinner for Republican governors and guests at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. ''She's in the big leagues now,'' added the woman, who demurred when asked to give her name. ''Every little move she makes is going to count.''
world/europe,Europeans Debate Castration of Sex Offenders - The New York Times PRAGUE — Pavel remembers the violent night sweats two days before the murder. He went to see a family doctor, who said they would go away. But after viewing a Bruce Lee martial arts film, he said, he felt uncontrollable sexual desires. He invited a 12-year-old neighbor home. Then he stabbed the boy repeatedly. His psychiatrist says Pavel derived his sexual pleasure from the violence. More than 20 years have passed. Pavel, then 18, spent seven years in prison and five years in a psychiatric institution. During his last year in prison, he asked to be surgically castrated. Having his testicles removed, he said, was like draining the gasoline from a car hard-wired to crash. A large, dough-faced man, he is sterile and has forsaken marriage, romantic relationships and sex, he said. His life revolves around a Catholic charity, where he is a gardener. “I can finally live knowing that I am no harm to anybody,” he said during an interview at a McDonald’s here, as children played loudly nearby. “I am living a productive life. I want to tell people that there is help.” He refused to give his last name for fear of being hounded. Whether castration can help rehabilitate violent sex offenders has come under new scrutiny after the Council of Europe’s anti-torture committee last month called surgical castration “invasive, irreversible and mutilating” and demanded that the Czech Republic stop offering the procedure to violent sex offenders. Other critics said that castration threatened to lead society down a dangerous road toward eugenics.
world/europe,The Czech Republic has allowed at least 94 prisoners over the past decade to be surgically castrated. It is the only country in Europe that uses the procedure for sex offenders.  Czech psychiatrists supervising the treatment — a one-hour operation that involves removal of the tissue that produces testosterone — insist that it is the most foolproof way to tame sexual urges in dangerous predators suffering from extreme sexual disorders. Surgical castration has been a means of social control for centuries. In ancient China, eunuchs were trusted to serve the imperial family inside the palace grounds; in Italy several centuries ago, youthful male choir members were castrated to preserve their high singing voices. These days it can  be used to treat testicular cancer and some advanced cases of prostate cancer. Now, more countries in Europe are considering requiring or allowing chemical castration for violent sex offenders. There is intense debate over whose rights take precedence: those of sex offenders, who could be subjected to a punishment that many consider cruel, or those of society, which expects protection from sexual predators. Poland is expected to become the first nation of the European Union to give judges the right to impose chemical castration on at least some convicted pedophiles, using hormonal drugs to curb sexual appetite; the impetus for the change was the arrest of a 45-year-old man in September who had fathered two children by his young daughter. Spain, after a convicted pedophile killed a child, is considering plans to offer chemical castration.
world/europe,Last year, the governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, signed legislation requiring courts to order chemical castration for offenders convicted  of certain sex crimes a second time. In the Czech Republic, the issue was brought home last month when Antonin Novak, 43, was sentenced to life in prison after raping and killing Jakub Simanek, a 9-year-old boy who disappeared last May. Mr. Novak, who had served four and a half years in prison for sexual offenses in Slovakia, had been ordered to undergo outpatient  treatment, but had failed to show up several months  before the murder. Advocates of surgical castration argued that had he been castrated, the tragedy could have been prevented. Hynek Blasko, Jakub’s father, expressed indignation that human rights groups were putting the rights of criminals ahead of those of victims. “My personal tragedy is that my son is in heaven and he is never coming back, and all I have left of him is 1.5 kilograms of ashes,” he said in an interview. “No one wants to touch the rights of the pedophiles, but what about the rights of a 9-year-old boy with his life ahead of him?” Ales Butala, a Slovenian human rights lawyer who led the Council of Europe’s delegation to the Czech Republic, argued that surgical castration was unethical, because it was not medically necessary and deprived castrated men of the right to reproduce. He also challenged its effectiveness, saying that the council’s committee had discovered three cases of castrated Czech sex offenders who had gone on to commit violent crimes, including pedophilia and attempted murder.
world/europe,Although the procedure is voluntary, Mr. Butala said that he believed some offenders felt they had no choice. “Sex offenders are requesting castration in hope of getting released from a life of incarceration,” he said. “Is that really free and informed consent?” But government health officials here and some Czech psychiatrists counter that castration can be effective and argue that by seeking to outlaw the practice, the council is putting potential victims at risk. Dr. Martin Holly, a leading sexologist and psychiatrist who is director of the Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, said none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offenses. A Danish study of 900 castrated sex offenders in the 1960s suggested the rate of repeat offenses dropped after surgical castration to 2.3 percent from 80 percent. But human rights groups say that such studies are inconclusive because they rely on self-reporting by sex offenders. Other psychiatric experts argue that sexual pathology is in the brain and cannot be cured by surgery. Dr. Holly, who has counseled convicted sex offenders for four decades, stressed that the procedure was being allowed only for repeat violent offenders who suffered from severe sexual disorders. Moreover, he said, the procedure is undertaken only with the informed consent of the patient and with the approval of an independent committee of psychiatric and legal experts. Jaroslav Novak, chief of urology at the Faculty Hospital Na Bulovce in Prague, said: “This is not a very common procedure. We carry it out maybe once every one to two years at most.”
world/europe,Several states, including Texas, Florida and California, now allow or mandate chemical castration for certain convicted sex offenders. Dr. Fred S. Berlin, founder of the Sexual Disorders Clinic at Johns Hopkins University, argued that chemical castration was less physically harmful than surgery and that it provided a safeguard, because a psychiatrist could inform the courts or police if the patient ordered to undergo treatment failed to show up. A surgically castrated patient, Dr. Berlin said, can order testosterone over the Internet. For Hynek Blasko, the father of Jakub Simanek, neither form of castration is the answer. “These people must be under permanent detention where they can be monitored,” he said. “There has to be a difference between the rights of the victim and the perpetrator.”
sports/baseball,Keeping Yoenis Cespedes, Mets Step Up to the Plate - The New York Times This was the test, the proving ground for the Mets as annual playoff contenders. At some point, they would have to take a risk to keep their new identity.  By agreeing to a reported four-year, $110 million contract extension with Yoenis Cespedes on Tuesday, they have. Given how desperately the Mets needed him back, the deal looks reasonable. Cespedes turned 31 last month, the same age as Albert Pujols and Robinson Cano when they scored 10-year contracts earlier this decade. Those players were changing teams and used leverage to the fullest. Cespedes never wanted to leave. He showed that last winter, when he returned with a three-year deal that everybody knew would last only one season. As an All-Star who led the Mets back to October, Cespedes dutifully exercised his opt-out clause and entered free agency again. Yet he did not play this out deep into the winter, or force the Mets into an instantly regrettable deal. Even so, he made out very well. Cespedes’s $27.5 million average annual salary matches the second highest ever for a major league position player, after Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera ($31 million). It is also a record for the Mets. They had to go somewhere they had never gone before, and they did.
sports/baseball,In terms of total value, this is not the richest deal in team history. The last two that were more expensive: the eight-year, $138 million extension for David Wright, and the six-year, $137.5 million deal the Mets gave Johan Santana after trading for him in 2007. Santana and Wright were both younger at the start of those contracts than Cespedes is now, but injuries doomed Santana and haunt Wright now. The Santana deal — and the wasted dollars spent on Jason Bay, Luis Castillo and Oliver Perez — roughly coincided with the Bernard L. Madoff scandal, which ravaged the Mets’ finances. The Wilpons drastically chopped payroll, and their forced retreat worked. Under Sandy Alderson, the Mets groomed the prospects Omar Minaya left behind, added more, and won the 2015 National League pennant. A wild card followed in 2016, when Cespedes helped rescue the Mets as their season seemed to collapse under an avalanche of injuries. When he returned from a quadriceps injury on Aug. 19, the Mets were under .500. He hit .364 through the end of the month, pointing the Mets to a winning course. After their playoff loss to Madison Bumgarner and the San Francisco Giants, the Mets faced an off-season in which Cespedes and second baseman Neil Walker could leave as free agents. The two combined for 54 homers last season and had the highest on-base percentages of any Mets regulars: .354 for Cespedes, .347 for Walker.
sports/baseball,Losing either would have challenged a lineup that struggled to reach base and averaged just 4.14 runs per game, tied with Milwaukee for 11th in the N.L. But the Mets quickly retained Walker, who took a one-year, $17.2 million qualifying offer to rebuild value after back surgery, and now Cespedes has returned. The Mets should not be congratulated too heartily. The Cespedes deal is merely what a big-market contender with a bargain rotation is supposed to do. But it shows that the post-Madoff Mets really are serious, willing to make a sensible gamble on a slugger they now know and trust. According to terms of the new deal disclosed by three people directly involved in it, the Mets’ full-season outlays to Cespedes, including last season, come to $137.5 million for five years — premium value for a premium talent. Cespedes has flaws. He is prone to striking out, and his on-base percentage across two recent seasons — 2013 and 2014 — was about .300. If he regresses, he will seem overpaid. Some shorter-term deals, like Philadelphia’s five-year contracts to Ryan Howard and Cliff Lee and the Angels’ five-year Josh Hamilton debacle, were hardly bargains. But the Mets had no choice. This is their moment to spend big on the lineup, with their starting pitchers still so far from reaching the open market. Jacob deGrom cannot be a free agent until after the 2020 season, a year before Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz. Matt Harvey is up after 2018.
sports/baseball,All had arm trouble last season, and now the redoubtable Bartolo Colon is gone to Atlanta. But it is still an encouraging foundation, and to waste it by skimping on the lineup — and passing on a fair deal like this — would have been insulting to the fans. There is still work to do. The bullpen needs help, especially with closer Jeurys Familia’s status uncertain because of a possible domestic-violence suspension. The outfield is crowded, with no real spot for Jay Bruce, who makes $13 million. The Mets need more from catcher and first base next season. But the Mets answered their most pressing questions on Tuesday, for the small and big pictures. They retained their most productive hitter and showed they can still handle the risk of a nine-figure contract. The most electrifying hitter in New York stays right where he belongs.
us,Ferguson Images Evoke Civil Rights Era and Changing Visual Perceptions - The New York Times Danny Lyon, one of the photographers whose work came to define the civil rights upheaval in the South in the 1960s, said he was struck on Thursday when he saw a news image from the racially torn suburb of Ferguson, Mo., showing four police officers arrayed in a phalanx. In part, it was because Mr. Lyon had taken a picture in 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., that looked very much like it: four officers standing in front of a police car with rifles and helmets, in a city where highly publicized clashes between protesters and the police helped turn the tide of public opinion toward the civil rights movement. But the image from Ferguson, for all its formal similarities, could not have been more different. Today’s riot police officers were wearing military-style camouflage and carrying military-style rifles, their heads and faces obscured by black helmets and gas masks as they stood in front of an armored vehicle. “It didn’t look like America. It looked like Soweto,” Mr. Lyon said, referring to the South African township that was a hotbed of protests against apartheid. “It looked like soldiers. And soldiers’ job isn’t to protect. Their job is to kill people and to be ready to die.”
us,The photographs that have emerged during several days of unrest in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer have drawn mournful comparisons to pictures of the Deep South in the 1960s or of more recent racial unrest, like the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But they have also prompted a flood of commentary about the differences half a century has made in the visual economy. They have raised questions about whether photos have the same power now to sway public opinion and political will; about the increasingly sophisticated ways an image-saturated public reads a picture’s racial and political subtext; and about the rapid transformation of the protests, even more so than the Los Angeles riots or the Occupy movement, into a war of images. The war pits what appears to be a large-scale paramilitary police presence against crowds of African-American protesters walking with their hands raised in surrender — or people throwing things and looting. The Philadelphia Daily News was a case in point in the speed with which 21st-century image parsing can occur. In the wee hours of Thursday morning — in response to readers’ comments on Twitter about a photo the newspaper had planned to run on its front page, showing an African-American protester in Ferguson about to hurl what looked like a firebomb — editors changed their minds and instead used a photograph of an African-American woman standing in front of police officers, holding a sign urging answers in the death of the teenager, Michael Brown.
us,An assistant city editor wrote on Twitter to those objecting to the first picture that they would be able to understand the whole story, in a “sympathetic treatment,” if they opened the paper. But a reader responded, “Yes, in ten-point font I can see the fine print, which is completely overwhelmed by the picture.” In the civil rights era, the visual stamp of the movement was determined by newspapers and the nightly news. Today, the imagery one sees depends on the filters one uses. One person’s Twitter feed may be full of footage of police firing tear gas or of peaceful protesters with their hands up. But David J. Garrow, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh’s law school and the author of several books on the civil rights movement, noted that when he searched for images of Ferguson on Google, roughly half showed what appeared to be looting. Such images look “more like Watts in 1965 or Newark in 1967, not Birmingham in 1963 or Selma in 1965,” Dr. Garrow said. And historically, he said, such photos were “deadly when it came to white public opinion.” In Ferguson, the police seem to be just as worried about the dominance of certain imagery. The city’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, said during a news conference Thursday that officials were meeting “to talk about not only the tactics but the appearance” of the police force, whose resemblance to American soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan has quickly become a social media theme.
us,Some visual echoes of the 1960s, like the Ferguson police’s use of dogs, may be unintentional. (During the 1963 March on Washington, President John F. Kennedy forbade the use of dogs for crowd control, knowing how badly it would play.) But on the protesters’ side, there have been deliberate efforts to evoke the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era, like T-shirts with the slogan “I Am a Man,” borrowed from signs carried during the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike. Diane McWhorter, the author of “Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution,” said she also saw echoes of those signs in the protesters’ hands-up gesture, an instantly recognizable cue that seems to be both born of the quick-read Internet news cycle and able to shape it. “In one case, it’s a kind of mass witness of personhood,” Ms. McWhorter said of the “I Am a Man” signs, “and in the other case, a mass witness of innocence. Those images are very powerful.” Some historians see dangers in those visual echoes. Martin A. Berger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of “Seeing Through Race: A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography,” said that while images of a protester throwing a firebomb or of the police spraying tear gas may start conversations, the historical associations can also distort public understanding.
us,“We can look at these pictures and say that Ferguson is the same as Los Angeles or Birmingham, because it looks the same,” Dr. Berger said. “But we have to ask not just, ‘What is the same?’ but also, ‘What are the ways in which America has changed?’ To just have another conversation that stops at the level of police brutality doesn’t really get us very far.”
nyregion,$5.45 Billion Deal for Stuyvesant Town Completed After Threatened Lawsuit  - The New York Times Amid the holiday season, SL Green Realty Corporation, New York City’s largest commercial landlord, dropped a bombshell: It told real estate executives and city officials last week that it would file a lawsuit to block the imminent $5.45 billion sale of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Manhattan’s largest apartment complex. The very notion jolted executives at CWCapital Asset Management, the company that was selling the 11,232-unit complex on behalf of bondholders. A lawsuit could upend a deal that they had hoped would close the books on one of the biggest financial debacles of the debt-fueled real estate boom in 2006. SL Green’s maneuver infuriated City Hall, which had very publicly blessed the pending sale and was eager to declare another victory in its battle for affordable housing in an increasingly unaffordable city. Blackstone Group, the buyer, wanted the deal done by Dec. 31, or else. Both parties held their breath as lawyers for buyer and seller alike scrambled day and night to complete the documents and sign the contract. It was just the latest example of why real estate is considered a full-contact sport in New York City, where billions of dollars are often at stake. Lawsuits are the weapon of choice, whether used to make a point or as leverage to squeeze out a payday. On Friday afternoon, the record-breaking sale to Blackstone was completed without any sign of a lawsuit.
nyregion,“Since taking over the complex, CWCapital has resolved four major litigations, doubled the cash flow and tripled the value of the asset,” Andrew MacArthur, a managing director, said in a statement. “We are very pleased we achieved a full recovery while simultaneously delivering long-term stability for the community.” But the deal did not close before SL Green was paid $10 million to go away, according to three executives involved in the negotiations who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. A spokesman for SL Green declined to comment. CWCapital declined to discuss SL Green. Making sense of the matter requires a scorecard, so follow closely. Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, a storied 80-acre complex near the East River, has been a middle-class redoubt for nearly seven decades. Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty Advisors bought the property in 2006 for $5.4 billion. The sale won high praise on Wall Street and set off alarms among tenants who feared that the debt-laden owners would push them out. The deal made no sense from Day 1. Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty Advisors lost the property to lenders three years later when they ran out of money. Their investors and lenders, including pension funds, the Church of England and the government of Singapore, lost more than $2 billion. Tenants were left in the lurch, and CWCapital took over management of the property.
nyregion,Having stabilized the complex, CWCapital announced in October that it would sell the complex to Blackstone. The city worked out a deal, which it said would ensure that 5,000 apartments would remain affordable to construction workers, teachers, firefighters and small-business owners. CWCapital did have to forge a settlement worth hundreds of millions of dollars with Centerbridge Partners. Centerbridge had bought Singapore’s bad loans at a steep discount and sued CWCapital over its fees. “Unlike 2006, this deal made sense,” said Douglas Harmon, the broker with Eastdil Secured who organized the Stuyvesant Town sale this year. “It’s built to withstand the vagaries of the market. No stakeholder — the buyers, the seller, bondholders, tenants or politicians — is displeased with the result.” Meanwhile, SL Green has been eager to build a 65-story skyscraper, 1 Vanderbilt, on the block next to Grand Central Terminal, about two and a half miles north of Stuyvesant Town. But a pesky real estate investor, Andrew S. Penson, has challenged the SL Green project in court. Mr. Penson’s partners include CWCapital’s parent company, Fortress Investment Group. SL Green, which had lent and lost $200 million on the 2006 Stuyvesant Town deal, saw an opening. A potential lawsuit at Stuyvesant Town could hurt both CWCapital and Fortress. According to documents in an unrelated lawsuit, CWCapital and Fortress had reaped $7.5 million a year in special servicing fees for running Stuyvesant Town, a total of $45 million over the last six years. They would gain an additional $15 million as a liquidation fee for the sale of Stuyvesant Town.
nyregion,Most important, CWCapital and Fortress would also get about $566 million in default interest on the senior mortgage as their tenure at Stuyvesant Town came to an end. SL Green made clear last week that it would not file suit against the Stuyvesant Town sale if Mr. Penson backed off 1 Vanderbilt, according to executives involved in the negotiations. That did not happen. CWCapital believed that a court would dismiss the lawsuit, as it had several others. But fearing that the suit could delay the closing, the company offered SL Green what it considered a token amount, $10 million. “Clearly, there’s no love lost between the two groups,” said one executive who was involved in the transaction. “SL Green’s threat was close enough to the closing that everyone was afraid. But it was obvious to all the parties that it had no merit. It was a nuisance and a distraction.”
nyregion,New York Officers and Mayor Reach Deal for 12% Raise Over 5 Years - The New York Times Mayor Bill de Blasio and the largest union representing New York police officers announced a contract deal on Tuesday, resolving an acrimonious and protracted standoff that threatened to become a distraction as the mayor seeks re-election. The contract, which must be ratified by the union’s 24,000 members, would give the police a raise higher than those in recent contracts signed with other uniformed unions, but city officials said that savings elsewhere in the deal offset it. Mr. de Blasio said the greater increase was justified by the change in techniques associated with “neighborhood policing,” the community-focused strategy he has championed. The deal also included an agreement that all officers below the rank of sergeant will wear body cameras by the end of 2019. “This is a paradigm shift, this is a moment of tremendous transformation within the N.Y.P.D.,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference at City Hall. He said the pay increases in the deal were “on par with other unions.” Mr. de Blasio stood beside Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the union, the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, who has been fiercely critical of the mayor. The police union has been without a negotiated contract for several years. The new deal is retroactive to August 2012 and lasts through July. It includes cumulative wage increases of 9.3 percent over five years, which officials said matched the pattern in contracts with other uniformed city workers, like firefighters and correction officers.
nyregion,But the officers would also get an additional raise of 2.25 percent in March, which officials called a neighborhood policing differential, though it would go to officers whether or not they were directly involved in neighborhood policing. Robert Linn, the labor commissioner, who acts as chief negotiator, said the cost of the additional 2.25 percent was offset by a reduction in the salary schedule for newly hired officers. Those officers’ pay would be $42,500, but after five and a half years officers would receive $85,292. The total compounded increase over the five years of the deal equals 11.73 percent, Mr. Linn said. He said the deal was completed at 4 a.m. Tuesday. Mr. Lynch has been one of Mr. de Blasio’s harshest critics, sending officers to protest outside the mayor’s gym in Brooklyn during Mr. de Blasio’s morning workouts, and at other mayoral events. “We wanted to get the mayor and his staff to focus on this agreement, and it worked,” Mr. Lynch said on Tuesday. The deal removes a potential source of irritation and conflict this year as Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, runs for a second term. Mr. Lynch has long pointed out that New York City officers earn less than officers in nearby suburbs, and he has insisted that the city make up the difference. “This moves us closer to market rate of pay,” he said.
dining,Fashioning Cast-Iron Pans for Today’s Cooks - The New York Times American cooks have frequent affairs with spiralizers, dry fryers and other shiny new toys. But they also have a deep, lasting relationship with one of the oldest cooking tools in the kitchen: the cast-iron skillet. “There aren’t many things in modern life that are passed down through generations and remain both beautiful and useful,” said Ronni Lundy, a historian of the food and agriculture of Appalachia, where cooking in a well-seasoned heirloom skillet is a touchstone of heritage. It’s true that my grandmother’s china is gathering dust. Your great-grandfather’s gold watch (admit it) lies unused in a drawer. But my parents’ 50-year-old cast-iron pans, with their glassine black cooking surfaces, are the inheritance I crave. “I have two that are just coming along now,” Ms. Lundy said in the nurturing tone usually reserved for children, sourdough starters and rosebushes. Well-seasoned cast-iron pans are the new broken-in jeans: proof of both good taste and hard use. In just the last five years, three new companies promising to make improved cast-iron skillets with a combination of traditional handwork and modern technology have begun production. And cast-iron collecting has taken off. Buyers seek rare skillets like the Erie Spider, the Griswold Slant and the Wapak Chickenfoot; an elusive Sidney No. 8 is listed on eBay for $1,500. With cast iron’s mystique comes mystery. The responsibility of seasoning a pan can be daunting; the idea of a pan that is never washed with soap can be alarming.
dining,But it is worth overcoming these obstacles because a well-used, well-seasoned cast-iron skillet is truly an all-purpose pan: nonstick enough to cook eggs, hot enough to sear anything and completely functional for roasting, stewing, simmering and baking. “You can caramelize a crust in cast iron in a way that would never happen in a sheet pan,” said Charlotte Druckman, who has just written a book on cast-iron baking. The nonstick surface of a cast-iron pan is achieved with natural ingredients like flaxseed oil, lard and time, not with synthetic coatings like Teflon or Thermolon. For all these reasons, even cooks without a tradition of cooking in cast iron now want to start one. Finex in Portland, Ore., Borough Furnace in Syracuse and the not-yet-settled Field Company all got initial funding on Kickstarter from hundreds of small backers, who eventually receive pans in return for their sponsorship. The Field Company, run by Chris and Stephen Muscarella (neither of whom is trained in metallurgy, casting or cooking), raised more than $1.6 million; their first pans will ship soon from a foundry they adapted in the Midwest. Finex is making 200 skillets a day and barely keeping up with demand from the United States and abroad, according to Mike Whitehead, a founder. The Finex 10-inch skillet sells for $165; the Borough Furnace equivalent for $280; the Field skillet for about $100. Why would anyone pay nearly $300 for a modern “artisanal” cast-iron skillet when a perfectly functional equivalent, made in South Pittsburg, Tenn., by the venerable Lodge company, costs $16 at Walmart?
dining,The answer lies in the craftsmanship of the past. The cast-iron pots — skillets, spiders (which sit in the embers of a fire) and Dutch ovens — made in the United States from the 18th century through the first half of the 20th, were different from today’s: lighter, thinner and with a smoother cooking surface. The Muscarella brothers grew up cooking with their mother’s old cast-iron pans — far from being collectors’ items, rusty skillets used to be offered two for a quarter at barn sales — and wondered why the pans they bought when they went out on their own were so comparatively unwieldy. To find out why, “we went down a rabbit hole,” said Chris Muscarella, and came out determined to produce new pans in the old style. Modern all-machine casting, he said, cannot produce pans that are as thin and smooth. Those pans were cast by now-famous makers like Griswold, Wagner, Sidney — and by dozens of now-anonymous foundries located in every sizable American town that also usually produced farm tools and weapons. Each pan was poured and polished by hand, a process that required hours of human labor but yielded a noticeable difference. “I fell in love with that smoothness,” said Mr. Whitehead of Finex. “But now that I make them, I realize why it went away. Labor is just so expensive.”
dining,Most of the new pans have smooth interiors and are sold preseasoned, which also explains their appeal to modern consumers. (There is a wealth of confusing and often contradictory information about seasoning online.) Each of the new makers has its own preferred system of cleaning and reseasoning, described on its website. But the basic principle is simple: Treat the pan as if you were a 19th-century cook, because the way people back then cooked and cleaned automatically seasoned their pans. Instead of plastic polymers, their skillets had natural coatings formed by cooking with fat and bonding fat molecules to the metal surface. So use the pan often, especially for projects like shallow frying or cooking bacon or browning chicken. Scrape the cooking surface clean with a stiff brush, a bench scraper or salt; rinse with very hot water and, if needed, a drop of soap; put it back on the stove over low heat until completely dry. It is not necessary to make a science project of creating the patina: Under these circumstances, it will simply happen. (If the pan is long unused, however, even the loveliest patina will become sticky, rusty or both. Store dry skillets in a cupboard or the oven to protect them from dust, with paper towels between them if stacked.) Nostalgia for old ways of cooking is powerful, but in this case it is also practical.
dining,“Cast iron is not responsive, but it is relentless,” said Nathan Myhrvold, the food scientist. No common cooking material has such a high “thermal mass,” or ability to absorb and store heat. Mr. Myhrvold, who runs a research center in Bellevue, Wash., called the Cooking Lab, which also produces the “Modernist Cuisine” books, said the common notion that cast iron is a good conductor of heat is a myth; in fact, the opposite is true. Cast iron grabs heat and holds on to it. “After you put the steak in contact with it, there’s a lot of spare heat left to cook with,” he said. “Cast iron doesn’t drop in temperature as much as thinner pans with better conductivity,” like aluminum and stainless steel. Thick-bottomed cast-iron pans evolved for use in charcoal embers and on wood stoves, when maximizing limited heat was the priority. In Appalachia, cast iron survived when many modern cooks switched to lighter pans, which heat up quickly on gas and electric stoves, Ms. Lundy said. “That skillet became part of the imagery of the Appalachian woman,” said Ms. Lundy, who identifies herself as a member of the “hillbilly diaspora” and has just published a cookbook called “Victuals.” She grew up in Louisville, Ky., and lives in North Carolina. Her family lived for at least four generations in Corbin, Ky., making everything from pork chops to cornbread, cobblers and even biscuits in cast iron. “The first thing any mountain cook will tell you is the history of her skillets,” she said.

Mr. Whitehead said a customer had recently come in to buy a Finex skillet after his first son was born. “The dad wants to start using it now,” he said, “so it will be ready for the boy when he turns 18.” Recipes: Flattened Chicken Thighs With Roasted Lemon Slices | Crisp Toffee Bars

insider,The Response in South Korea to Threats of War? A Collective ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea — A young, brash dictator in North Korea threatens to lob nuclear missiles at South Korea and its ally, the United States. From Washington, the leader of the world’s most powerful country threatens to slam the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Headlines brim with talk of possible war on the Korean Peninsula. How do South Koreans react? With a shrug. I was born in South Korea and have reported on its region for American news media for most of my career — for The New York Times since 2005. And yet, whenever I have to report a recurring “crisis” over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, I feel as if I am living in two different realities. On one hand, there is a deluge of urgent headlines: Analysts and pundits expound North Korea’s latest motives, serving up their newest estimates on its weapons capabilities. (And, of course, there are President Trump’s Twitter storms. But if he knows how to grab headlines with colorful language, North Korea has mastered that game for decades.) On the other hand, once I step outside the media and pundit circles, I meet a prevailing calm, even a nonchalance. The truth is, most South Koreans seem to take things in stride. People in Seoul on Friday evenings are as merry as ever, unmoved by the fact that their city of 10 million lies within the range of North Korean artillery, rockets and missiles.
insider,People here have complained about a recent heat wave more than they’ve discussed the possibility of war. None of my South Korean relatives called me about the North Korean threat. And South Korean journalist friends of mine were hoping, seriously, that they could get a trip to Guam out of the North Korea news. (It’s a popular vacation spot for South Koreans.) All of which makes the shift from one of my worlds (news) to the other (ordinary life) feel as jarring as exiting a dark movie theater into bright daylight. The seeming indifference among South Koreans can be explained in part by the simple fact that, despite talk of possible war, there are no telltale signs of either the United States or North Korea preparing to start one. What might those signs be? A mass movement of North Korean troops and weapons toward the border; the arrival of American warships; the evacuation of 200,000 American civilians, and far more expat Chinese, from South Korea; the elevation of the Defcon military alert status. None of these have been reported, and stock prices in South Korea have hardly blinked. Behind the collective shrug among South Koreans is also a determination not to unsettle the status quo: a peace that has held for more than six decades under a cease-fire signed at the end of the Korean War. No matter how much they detest the regime in Pyongyang, South Koreans still consider North Koreans their brethren and want to avoid another internecine war.
insider,Still, the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning, even before I leave my bed, is to check the North Korean news agency to see if it has made another bombastic announcement — like the one in which the North recently threatened to launch ballistic missiles around Guam in an “enveloping fire.” But in spite of the rhetoric and the gravity of the military threat, many South Koreans insist that the best way to deal with the North is to keep calm and carry on, and to work together with the United States to deter and punish the North — while avoiding war. The nonchalance isn’t posturing. After the North launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 28, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea went on vacation. “He was busy posing for photos with tourists at vacation spots and didn’t even bother to call President Trump to discuss the North’s ICBM test,” Chung Woo-taik, a conservative opposition leader, said this week. (Mr. Moon talked with Mr. Trump on Aug. 7 after he returned from his trip.) But Mr. Moon’s supporters say overreacting to the North will only serve its leader Kim Jong-un’s strategy of appearing dangerous and reckless, as part of an effort to win concessions. Many here seem to agree — with a shrug.
world/africa,Beneath Mask of Normal Nigerian Life, Young Lives Scarred by Boko Haram - The New York Times MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — She hears the awful sounds in her dreams. They are the moans of a dying girl. Amina is haunted by the memory. After all, she was the one who handed the girl to Boko Haram. Amina was a teenager herself when Boko Haram, the Islamist fighters who have rampaged across northeast Nigeria, kidnapped and conscripted her. Sixteen and scared, Amina did their bidding, seizing young girls from their homes and escorting them to a camp where many were forcibly married off to fighters. One of the terrified girls was 14. Amina grabbed her by the wrists, leading her to a waiting vehicle. Three weeks later, the girl was dead after being gang raped. “I think about her a lot,” Amina said, swallowing hard and closing her eyes. Boko Haram has abducted many hundreds, if not thousands, of girls and boys across the region, forcing them to fight, to cook, to clean and even to bear children. To much of the world, the kidnapping of nearly 300 girls from their school dormitory in the town of Chibok three years ago was the seminal moment in the crisis, followed by another horror: children, as young as 7 or 8, being used as suicide bombers. The Nigerian military has made recent gains, pushing into the forests where Boko Haram hides and recapturing areas once under its control. But throughout the war, now in its eighth year, hundreds of thousands of people have fled here to Maiduguri, the battle-weary capital where the conflict began.
world/africa,It is a place where former fighters and captives like Amina blend into the urban tapestry, a place where nearly everyone has been a victim, a collaborator — or both. With its busy tea cafes, flaming kebab stands and rush-hour traffic, Maiduguri seems like a city returning to its old self. Suicide bombers, many of them girls, still periodically set upon the mostly Muslim city. But the days of house-to-house fighting that once terrorized residents are over. Roadside stalls offer fried doughnuts, storefront gates open every morning to sell clothing and office supplies, morning commuters guzzle caffeine and university students picnic at the zoo. But behind the cover of daily life, terrible secrets loom. A teenager selling sugar cane on the corner may have killed someone, but he isn’t sure. A smiling little boy, dressed in a school uniform as he weaves between grown-ups on the sidewalk, once bore a gun for the rebels, dragging it by the muzzle because it was too heavy for him to carry. A young woman with college ambitions was raped by several fighters, then accompanied them on village raids. For them, building a new life is anything but certain. “Normal life of Maiduguri masks the scars that the conflict left for some children,” said Patrick Rose, a spokesman for Unicef. “These children have experienced horrific things.” On most days, Amina, now 18, can be found on the street selling detergent and broth with her mother — the only one who knows her secret.
world/africa,“I feel so guilty,” she said. A year and a half ago, insurgents would come and go in Amina’s hometown in the countryside. One day they decided to take her with them, shooting her older brother and tossing his body in the bush. They took her to a Boko Haram camp, where she was shocked by the huge number of women living there, many of them pregnant or with infants. Amina was told that she would have to marry one of the fighters, but would first accompany them on operations to help kidnap other girls. If she did not do so, she would be killed. “On my first outing with them, I abducted three,” said Amina, whose last name, like those of others in this article, is being withheld out of concern for their safety. Capturing other girls soon became a pattern for Amina. Fighters would enter a village with guns blazing, kill and kidnap men, and expect Amina and other girls to round up the young women. They were told to leave behind older villagers and anyone nursing babies. Kidnapping victims were easy to find. They were often crouched in terror in their homes. “When the girls would hear the gunshots, they’d run into their rooms and hide,” Amina said. Insurgents would sometimes enter the homes alongside Amina to make sure she was doing her job. Sometimes she would cry as she worked, dragging sobbing and screaming girls into waiting vehicles.
world/africa,On one outing, a man resisted attempts to steal his belongings and Amina watched insurgents shoot him dead. But it is the young girl’s abduction that weighs on Amina. Wailing in the back of a Boko Haram truck, the girl told Amina that she had watched fighters kill her parents. Amina remembers the girl being terrified, screaming that she didn’t want to have sex with fighters. She fainted more than once in the vehicle that drove her to the Boko Haram camp. At the camp, fighters didn’t bother the girl for about three weeks. Then one evening, Amina watched as they came for her. “There was one room at that camp, and any woman invited into that room knew what was going to happen in there,” Amina said. “While we were eating, we heard her cries, and we knew she was being raped.” One man after another entered. It lasted three days. When it was finally over, the girl couldn’t walk. Soon she was dead. Amina escaped from the camp soon after, flagging down a driver who took her to safety in Maiduguri. “He told me his daughter had also been captured by Boko Haram,” she said. Hadiza, 19, blends easily into the crowds of young women on the streets of Maiduguri, dressed in colorful dresses and head scarves. She lives with her parents, who fled their village in the countryside, and hopes to go to college to study science.
world/africa,Just a year ago, she was living with the rebels. They respected her, she said, and liked the way she shouted, “God is great!” and fired her gun in the air. They called her “rugged.” Hadiza was 17 when she was kidnapped and raped by three militants. They trained her to use a weapon, and she accompanied them on raids of villages, spraying bullets in the night and shouting to terrify residents. “First and foremost, we scared them,” she said. The militants respected her bravado. They called her a hero, she said. The praise was in some ways exciting, and it offered protection. “Those who were quiet, they always wanted to rape them,” Hadiza said. Mustapha Ali sells sugar cane on a busy street corner, saving up to pay for an urban-planning degree he hopes to earn one day. Two years ago, Mustapha, now 18, was armed with an AK-47, attacking villages alongside Boko Haram fighters who told him to join them or die. “So I pledged my loyalty to them,” Mustapha said. Two of his brothers refused to join them on that day when the rebels swarmed his village, he said, and he watched as they killed them. He was taken to a camp where weapons were distributed to captives like him, including two boys from his village who had also been forcibly recruited. Soon, Mustapha was riding motorbikes with Boko Haram members as they raided villages and stole cattle and sheep. During one raid, a woman was dragged out of her home.
world/africa,“You pagan!” Mustapha recalled fighters shouting at her before one threw her to the ground, pulled out a knife and beheaded her. “I was there. I saw everything,” he said. “I was so afraid. From that day on, I did whatever they told me to do.” The attacks he took part in were always at night, and while Mustapha fired his weapon along with the other men when entering villages, he said, it was too dark to know where his bullets landed. “It was hard for me to tell if I killed anyone,” he said. Fighters told him to pick a wife from among the kidnapped girls. He chose a girl he knew from his village. He was fond of her and decided that if he didn’t pick her, a stranger would. Militants watched him have sex with her the first time, to make sure he really did it. When Nigerian soldiers fought their way into their camp, Mustapha ran, leaving behind the girl he had married — she refused to go — and kept running. He eventually found his way to Maiduguri, where he has been reunited with his parents, who had fled there to escape the fighters. He is living with them, putting money aside from his sugar cane sales to pay for college. “I’m struggling,” he said. In one of the many nondescript, one-room concrete homes in Maiduguri, Abbani and Hudu have found a new family.
world/africa,When Hudu was 7, Boko Haram fighters came to his village and locked him in a room while they slaughtered his parents. He could hear them screaming. “I was crying and shouting: ‘Oh, God. Oh, my parents. Oh, Dad,’” said Hudu, who is now 9. “And they said, ‘Keep quiet or we will kill you, too.’” Militants took Hudu with them and put him on top of an armored vehicle stolen from the military. He was in charge of feeding an ammunition chain into a weapon mounted there. “I had to put bullets into the big gun,” he said. “Every day, I had to be on top. I spent almost the whole time on top. Every day, they would shoot, even when they didn’t see anyone.” Abbani was 10 when he watched Boko Haram behead his father and then his mother after they refused to join the fighters who had invaded their village. “I was standing next to them, and crying and screaming and trying to get to my parents, so they tied me up,” said Abbani, now 12. The militants made Abbani work as a porter, hauling sacks of their belongings from camp to camp. Worried the military was closing in, they trained him to use a weapon. “They gave me a gun and said to shoot the army,” he said. “It was so heavy I couldn’t carry it, so I had to drag it on the ground.”
world/africa,The Nigerian military invaded that day, and Abbani managed to flee the camp. He saw a teenage girl hiding in a field of grass and flowers. She told him to drop his gun. “So I threw it away and ran to her,” he said. “She held me tight, and we ran to another place to hide.” As he and the girl, Aisha, ran, they came across Hudu alone in the bush with an AK-47. He was screaming and shooting bullets wildly everywhere, holding his finger on the trigger. Aisha hid Abbani behind a tree and ran to Hudu, who had fallen to the ground. Blood from a head wound was covering his face. “I took them both and ran,” said Aisha, who herself was fleeing Boko Haram captivity. She didn’t know it then, but she was pregnant with the baby of a militant. The boys, who consider each other brothers, now live with Aisha, 18, and her baby in Maiduguri. On a recent night, two pet rabbits hopped about, sneaking bites of yams and cabbage that Aisha had prepared for the family’s dinner. The boys call her mother.
us,THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ECONOMY; Roots of Prosperity Reach Past Clinton Years - The New York Times Any claim that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have to credit for the country's long run of prosperity dates to the evening of Aug. 6, 1993. That was when Mr. Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate on the administration's plan to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes and restraining spending, a move fraught with political as well as economic risks. Republicans, not one of whom voted for it, predicted that the legislation would choke what had been a fragile recovery from the 1990-91 recession. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore asserted that it would unlock the economy's potential by easing the pressure on interest rates, and they say history has proved them correct. ''Twenty-two million new jobs and the greatest prosperity ever,'' Mr. Gore said in touting the outcome in his debate with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday night. Even critics of the administration acknowledge that the 1993 budget plan did not have the dire effects Republicans had warned of, and there is a widespread consensus that it helped support the wave of business investment that has characterized the economy in recent years. But many economists say it is a considerable stretch to suggest, as Mr. Gore often does, that the powerful expansion of the 1990's was born with the passage of that plan.
us,For one thing, they say, other policy decisions played a role in straightening out the government's finances. Among them were a deficit-reduction bill signed by President George Bush in 1990 and a deal between Mr. Clinton and the Republican Congress in 1997 that cut capital gains taxes while further restricting spending. Moreover, economists and business executives say, much of what happened to the economy in the 1990's had little to do with Washington and was part of a process that began before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore took office. At the same time that the administration was setting out to address the fiscal mess, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to hold interest rates at rock-bottom levels throughout 1992 and 1993 was giving the economy a kick as it emerged haltingly from the recession that ended in March 1991. In the private sector, companies were starting to see the benefits of painful steps to make themselves more competitive at home and abroad, including plant closings and layoffs of previously secure middle managers. And perhaps most important, years of technological progress were beginning to click into place in a way that promised tremendous benefits, most notably through a pickup in productivity, the basic measure of efficiency and the best predictor of long-term economic potential. By acting as a brake on inflation, the surge in productivity allowed the Fed more flexibility in holding down interest rates in the mid- and late-1990's, and helped generate profits and wealth that in turn created huge new tax revenues for the government and turned budget deficits into surpluses.
us,''Clinton came in at a time when technological innovation was at a sweet spot,'' said William C. Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm. ''He's gotten the benefits of technical innovation that other presidents didn't benefit from. But he didn't do anything to squelch it, and undertook policies to encourage not squelching it.'' Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the economy's recovery in the early years of the administration was mostly driven by the Fed's low interest rates, and that the economic strength in the second half of the 1990's primarily came from investments by business in technology. ''The Clinton administration merits credit for some early deficit reduction and for letting the Federal Reserve have its independence, and that's it,'' Mr. Jasinowski said. ''The amount of credit the administration gets is a bronze medal behind the Federal Reserve and the private sector's expansion of productivity.'' When it comes to the economy, the administration often points to its success in opening foreign markets to trade and in helping low-income workers through increases in the minimum wage and an expansion of the tax credit for the working poor. But inside the White House, the 1993 budget plan is seen as the single most crucial turning point. At the urging of Mr. Gore, as well as advisers like Robert E. Rubin, then chairman of the White House's National Economic Council, and outsiders like Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, Mr. Clinton decided as he took office in 1993 that the economy was being held back largely by the dead weight of the budget deficit, which at that time was projected to grow inexorably.
us,The administration's 1993 proposal to raise taxes infuriated Republicans, and its plan to restrict spending frustrated Mr. Clinton, who had pledged to increase spending in areas like education. But the administration was betting that there would be an economic payoff in that narrowing the deficit would reduce the government's borrowing needs and would therefore increase the pool of capital available for private investment. More capital means downward pressure on interest rates. Lower rates would make it more affordable for companies to expand and modernize, and for consumers to buy houses and cars. There was considerable debate among economists and on Wall Street about whether the strategy would work. In the end, administration officials say, things unfolded just as they had predicted. As Mr. Gore put it on Tuesday night, the ingenuity of the American people should get credit for the strong economy, but the American people also had plenty of ingenuity eight years ago when the economy was in the doldrums and the deficit was out of control. ''The difference is we've got a new policy,'' Mr. Gore said in the debate. At times he has been even more explicit about claiming the credit. ''I voted and we won and then we've had an economic recovery since then,'' he said in a speech on the economy late last year. But while the administration tends to credit the improving fiscal situation with igniting the technology and productivity revolution, many economists and business executives think it was the other way around.
us,Indeed, there were already powerful forces reshaping the economy before the deficit reduction plan passed. Five months before Mr. Gore's tie-breaking vote in the Senate that August, engineers at the Intel Corporation in Silicon Valley had introduced their new Pentium chip. The Pentium was the latest in a string of advances in semiconductor technology and software throughout Silicon Valley that within a few years would help bring the Internet to every desktop while driving computing power up and computer prices down. And even as the Pentium was being introduced, engineers at Intel, under intense competitive pressure from equally fast and innovative rivals, were halfway through development of a successor that would cram 75 percent more transistors onto a chip and run three times as fast. ''That's when everything really came together,'' said Albert Yu, a senior vice president at Intel, describing the atmosphere of rapid-fire progress in the technology business in 1993. Dana G. Mead, who through most of the decade held the No. 1 or No. 2 jobs at Tenneco, a sprawling conglomerate, said that by 1993 his company and others were seeing the combined effects of more aggressive management efforts to cut costs and years of investment in automation and information technology. ''In the early 1990's, after a decade of this investment, we were finally beginning to see real improvement,'' Mr. Mead said.
us,So convinced was Mr. Mead that businesses were operating in a fundamentally more efficient way that he took his message directly to Mr. Greenspan at the Fed in 1995. If the Fed could be convinced that corporate America was better at absorbing costs and producing more for less, Mr. Mead said, then perhaps the Fed would not be so quick to raise interest rates when economic growth picked up. Unbeknownst to Mr. Mead, Mr. Greenspan was already thinking along the same lines. In early 1994, even as the Fed enacted the first in a yearlong series of rate increases, Mr. Greenspan told a closed meeting of the Fed's top policy makers that ''something different'' was going on. Long before other analysts noticed anything, Mr. Greenspan raised the possibility of an extraordinary pickup in the growth rate of productivity, which had mysteriously tapered off in the early 1970's and to that point had shown no clear signs of revival, according to transcripts of the meeting made public this year. Over the next five years, as the Fed chairman became increasingly convinced he was correct, it led him to allow far higher levels of growth in the economy than traditional economic theory held was prudent. But while Mr. Greenspan had helped convince Mr. Clinton that there would be an economic payoff for deficit reduction, the Fed chairman has always stopped well short of suggesting that there was a direct link between the upturn in productivity and the 1993 budget plan.
us,Mr. Greenspan takes a much longer view. He often traces today's prosperity to the development of the transistor after World War II, and a whole series of technological advances since then that converged in the 1990's to supercharge the economy in a way that has happened periodically but infrequently throughout history.
us,For First Time, Justices Reject Punitive Award - The New York Times Overturning a $2 million punitive-damage award to an Alabama man who bought a new BMW with a touched-up paint job, the Supreme Court set new standards today for determining when an award of punitive damages is so "grossly excessive" as to violate the constitutional requirement of due process of law. The 5-to-4 decision marked the first time in more than a decade of wrestling  with the punitive-damages issue that the Court had actually overturned an award  as excessive. The decision, with a majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens and over the dissents of four Justices who said the Court should not intrude in  an area traditionally reserved for state law, came in a high-profile case that had become something of a poster child of the debate -- now going on in Congress and the Presidential campaign as much as in the courts -- over revising the tort system. The majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.  Kennedy, David H. Souter, and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a  dissenting opinion that was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also wrote a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also signed. In his decision, Justice Stevens said the award went far beyond what BMW might have reasonably expected to suffer for its conduct and said courts should  consider factors like "degree of reprehensibility" and the mathematical ratio between punitive and actual damages in deciding whether to uphold awards.
us,But the decision, BMW v. Gore, No. 94-896, left a number of important questions unanswered, offering what it called "guideposts" rather than specific  formulas for assessing the fairness of punitive-damage awards. The case now returns to the Alabama Supreme Court. The Court is also likely to vacate decisions in more than a dozen other punitive-damage cases on its docket and send those back to the state courts as well. A clear view of the boundaries of the Court's analysis today is likely to emerge only gradually, as state courts adjust their practices. "Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the severity of the penalty that a state may impose," Justice Stevens said. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia derided what Justice Stevens called "guideposts" as "criss-crossing platitudes" that he said marked "a road to nowhere." But while the ruling will clearly not end the debate, "it really gives lawyers and courts something to work with in terms of structuring the inquiry,"  Andrew L. Frey, the lawyer who won the case for BMW, said in an interview today. An Alabama jury had originally awarded $4 million, calculating the damages based on the manufacturer's behavior not only in Alabama -- where 14 customers,  including the plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, Jr., had bought new cars that had been repainted to correct minor paint damage -- but throughout the country.
us,Nearly 1,000 repainted BMW's had been sold as new in the 10 years before the  1992 trial, most in states where, like Alabama, there was no law on the books that made the specific practice illegal. Viewing the practice as consumer fraud, the Alabama jury reached its $4-million verdict by multiplying 1,000 by the $4,000 it calculated as the loss of value to Dr. Gore's $40,000 car from the paint repair, which itself cost $601.37. The Alabama Supreme Court, in a 1993 ruling, cut the award in half on the ground that an Alabama jury could not rely on "acts that occurred in other jurisdictions." The majority today strongly agreed with that analysis, while finding the smaller award still too high. "While each state has ample power to protect its own consumers, none may use  the punitive-damages deterrent as a means of imposing its regulatory policies on the entire Nation," Justice Stevens said. Using legal jargon for "wrongdoer," Justice Stevens said that "a state may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States." While an important part of the ruling, this analysis was also a source of ambiguity, because Justice Stevens said that "we need not consider" whether one  state's courts could take into account conduct that was illegal in other states. Product liability cases that involve dangerous or negligently made products are  likely to raise this question.
us,Earlier this month, President Clinton vetoed a bill that would have set limits on punitive damages, in both state and Federal courts, in cases involving faulty products. During the Presidential primaries, Republicans ran advertisements attacking the liability system and calling for drastic reform. But the failure of a two-year-long Congressional effort was likely to shift attention to the courts as the forum where the next act in the punitive-damages  drama would play out. In his opinion, Justice Stevens said the $2 million award against BMW failed  three tests that courts should use to make sure that a defendant had adequate notice of exposure to heavy punitive damages. The first was the "degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct": whether the behavior had put people's health or safety at risk, for example, or  whether there was evidence of bad faith. In this case, Justice Stevens said, there was only minor economic injury and "no deliberate false statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of evidence of improper motive." He said BMW had no reason to think its practice violated Alabama law. The second of the "guideposts" was the ratio between the punitive and the actual damages, in this instance 500:1. Justice Stevens said the Court would continue to reject "the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula," but added that "when the ratio is a breathtaking 500 to 1, however, the award must surely raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow."
us,The third test was to compare the punitive-damage awards and any civil fines  or criminal punishment available in the state for similar conduct. In Alabama, the fine for violating the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act is $2,000. Justice Stevens noted that in New York, the penalty for a first-time violation of the equivalent consumer-protection law is $50. He said that while the Alabama courts were free to impose a punitive-damage award beyond the statutory fine, "we cannot, however, accept the conclusion of the Alabama Supreme Court that BMW's conduct was sufficiently egregious to justify a punitive sanction that is  tantamount to a severe criminal penalty." Justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion included a four-page appendix of recent actions or bills currently under consideration in the states to curb punitive damages. She said: "The Court, I am convinced, unnecessarily and unwisely ventures into territory traditionally within the states' domain, and does so in the fact  of reform measures recently adopted or currently under consideration in legislative arenas." Justice Scalia said the majority had accomplished "nothing at all except confer an artificial air of doctrinal analysis upon its essentially ad hoc determination that this particular award of punitive damages was not 'fair.' " He said: "I do not regard the 14th amendment's due-process clause as a secret repository of substantive guarantees against 'unfairness.' "
sports/basketball,Resigning From 76ers, Sam Hinkie Mounts a Defense as Shaky as His Team’s - The New York Times Sam Hinkie went to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2013 with a novel idea. He would not try to improve the team incrementally. Instead, he would tear it down, trading talented players for draft picks, and in the process earn other high picks by posting poor records. Then he would flip the switch, cash in the draft picks, use ample salary-cap room to bring in free agents and transform a terrible team into a championship one. Hinkie never got to flip the switch. Hinkie resigned as the team’s general manager Wednesday night. Under his stewardship, the Sixers won 19, 18 and, so far this season, 10 games. His 7,000-word resignation letter, obtained by ESPN, mounts a vigorous, if meandering, defense of his methods. It also includes references to Abraham Lincoln, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and the moa, an extinct flightless bird. Here is a look at some of Hinkie’s convictions, as expressed in his letter, and how they played out in his three seasons in charge: “A competitive league like the N.B.A. necessitates a zig while our competitors comfortably zag.” The Sixers had been on a treadmill of .500 ball for years when Hinkie arrived; perhaps bottoming out was the best way to reach the top? But Hinkie’s zig meant rolling out an atrocious team year after year. For owners and fans who initially supported his methods, the losing got to be too much.
sports/basketball,“You can be right for the wrong reasons. In our business, you’re often lionized for it. You can be wrong for the right reasons. ... The decision to draft Joel third, though, still looks to me to be the correct one in hindsight.” Joel Embiid, drafted No. 3 over all in 2014, missed the end of his single year at Kansas. He had foot surgery shortly before the draft. Setbacks followed, and he has still not played a minute in the N.B.A. “Use a decision journal. Write in your own words what you think will happen and why before a decision. Refer back to it later. See if you were right, and for the right reasons.” Hinkie’s two other marquee draft picks were, like Embiid, big men. Nerlens Noel, drafted No. 6 in 2013, has struggled on offense; Jahlil Okafor, No. 3 in 2015, has struggled on defense. Worse, the two have been unable to play effectively together. Okafor has also had trouble off the court, including nightclub altercations. All the young players on the team have seemed to suffer from a lack of veteran leadership to ease them into the N.B.A. “Check out the 10,000 Year Clock. It is no mere thought experiment, but an actual clock being designed to be placed inside a mountain in West Texas, wound, and left to tick and chime for ten thousand years. Why? Because to design something that lasts that long makes us all consider what the world will look like between now and then.”
sports/basketball,Hinkie’s long view — to be fair, it’s probably less than 10,000 years — meant that a good player was a liability, not an asset. The Sixers’ best player when Hinkie arrived was Jrue Holiday. He was traded. Thaddeus Young had his best year in Hinkie’s first season. He was traded. Hinkie scored a coup with the 11th pick in the 2013 draft, Michael Carter-Williams, who won the Rookie of the Year Award. He was traded. Hinkie’s own clock came up 9,997 years short. “The N.B.A. can be a league of desperation, those that are in it and those that can avoid it. So many find themselves caught in the zugzwang, the point in the game where all possible moves make you worse off. Your positioning is now the opposite of that.”  The team is reasonably well positioned for the future with an abundance of first-round draft picks and plenty of salary-cap room. Maybe it can indeed avoid the zugzwang. Maybe Embiid will get healthy. Maybe Dario Saric, a Croatian power forward acquired at the 2014 draft but still playing in Europe, will sign with the team and be special. Maybe the team can sign some big free agents, though why a star would want to join a team this abysmal is an open question. If the team does get good, Hinkie may even get some of the credit. But three seasons are lost, three seasons in which loyal fans watched the team lose again and again, while paying full N.B.A. prices.
sports/basketball,No matter how the Sixers fare in the future, those seasons will never come back.
us,Ammon Bundy and 7 Oregon Protesters Held; LaVoy Finicum Is Reported Dead - The New York Times JOHN DAY, Ore. — Ammon Bundy, the leader of an armed seizing of a federal wildlife refuge in rural eastern Oregon, was arrested and one person was killed Tuesday afternoon in a traffic stop in rural Oregon, the F.B.I. and the Oregon State Police said. Seven other people, including Mr. Bundy’s brother Ryan Bundy, were arrested, the authorities said. Another person was hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening. The authorities did not identify the man who was killed, but a member of the Nevada State Assembly, Michele Fiore, who has been a supporter of the Bundy family, said on Twitter that it was LaVoy Finicum. Mr. Finicum had become a de facto spokesman for the occupiers. The confrontation came after more than three weeks of growing tension and anxiety that put the tiny community of Burns — about a five-hour drive from Portland — into an international debate about homegrown right-wing militias, public lands and constitutional rights. Mr. Bundy, 40, and a group of his followers, adopting the name Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, about 30 miles southeast of Burns, in Harney County, on Jan. 2. Community leaders demanded that the group leave, but several members were still occupying the refuge Tuesday night, and on Wednesday morning, local media reported that roadblocks had been set up to limit access to the refuge.
us,The Bundy brothers and supporters were arrested along Highway 395 outside Burns around 4:25 p.m., officials said. Ammon Bundy and some of his group had been expected at a community meeting Tuesday night about 70 miles away in John Day, Ore., about 100 miles north of the Malheur refuge in Grant County, a county adjacent to Harney. Mr. Bundy was to be the guest speaker. They never arrived. For weeks, there was deep uncertainty as to how, when or, some said, even if law enforcement agents would take action. On Tuesday, the authorities appear to have strategically timed their stop of the protesters so that it was away from the refuge. The sheriff of Grant County, Glenn Palmer, had expressed sympathy for the occupation — saying that “the government is going to have to concede something” to the protesters, such as dismissing the F.B.I. from the area and releasing the Hammonds, the father-and-son ranching team whose imprisonment on arson charges was a rallying point for the Bundys. Members of the protest group had been suggesting in recent days that they might find a more sympathetic ear in Grant County, and that they might try to expand their activities there. Their plans to travel to John Day, which is linked to Malheur by a single highway, were well known in the area.
us,The Bundys and the other occupiers contend that the federal government had illegally taken land in Oregon and elsewhere around the West from ranchers and other private landholders over the decades, and they demanded that it be returned to local control. They also said they were supporting two local ranchers imprisoned for setting fires that spread to federal land. Oregon’s governor, Kate Brown, who has called on the federal government to enforce the law, asked Oregonians on Tuesday night to be patient as the investigation unfolded. The refuge is operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The F.B.I. and the Oregon State Police said that Mr. Bundy, his brother and three other people, including Shawna Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah, and Ryan Waylen Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Mont., were arrested on a state highway, but they provided no further details. Ms. Cox and Mr. Payne were prominent in speaking for the refuge. Also arrested on the highway was Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nev. The authorities said only that shots were fired during the course of the arrest. Two other people: Peter Santilli, 50, of Cincinnati, and Joseph Donald O’Shaughnessy, 45, of Cottonwood, Ariz., were arrested later in Burns, and John Eric Ritzheimer, 32, turned himself in to the police in Peoria, Ariz., the authorities said. All of the defendants face a federal felony charge of conspiracy to impede officers of the United States from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats.
us,At the refuge, a spokesman said they would wait out the night. Jason Patrick, an occupier, said that several people were still inside and that the mood was “prepared but calm.” “They said ‘peaceful resolution,’ but now there is a dead cowboy,” he said, adding that he believes the F.B.I. was “hellbent on war.” Mr. Patrick would not say whether the occupiers would stay at the refuge in the long term. “The plan is peaceful resolution through the night. Ammon says the sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he said. “We’ll let the sun shine and see what’s up.” Mr. Bundy’s family became a symbol of antigovernment sentiment in 2014 when his father, Cliven Bundy, inspired a standoff between armed local activists and federal officials seeking to confiscate cattle grazing illegally on federal land in Nevada. At the refuge, a 188,000-acre expanse of high desert sage that is known as one of the great migratory bird viewing areas of North America, vehement determination and low-key, soft-spoken declarations of belief mixed like oil and water on any given day. Supporters of the occupation — Mr. Santilli, in particular — were openly belligerent to counterprotesters and other opponents of the occupation. On one recent day, when an environmental group came bearing signs denouncing the occupation, Mr. Santilli screamed in their faces. Mr. Santilli was recording a live stream on Tuesday when he was taken into custody as he tried to re-enter the refuge. Supporters who were in a vehicle with him said in the video that they had been trying to evacuate some women and children.
us,Ms. Cox, in an interview inside a building at the refuge a few days before her arrest, also vowed to stay until the federal government handed it over to local control. “When the people come and take their rightful position, then we can go home,” she said. “They are coming; it’s just taking a little while.” Harney County, which has only about 7,100 people spread out over an area roughly the size of Massachusetts, has a small hospital in Burns, the biggest community. Law enforcement officials did not say where the injured person was treated. But St. Charles hospital in Bend, about 150 miles west of the refuge, was on lockdown Tuesday night, with no one other than patients and employees able to enter. There were 10 police cars and one fire truck in front. Two police officers with assault weapons were in the foyer. Officials would not confirm if any victims have been airlifted there.
fashion,Coming Out to His Conservative Parents: Is It Time? - The New York Times I am about to be a senior in high school, and I’m gay. No one knows except my best friend, a straight girl. She keeps telling me to come out, saying it’s the courageous thing to do. But my parents, unlike hers, are extremely conservative and religious. (I’ve heard my mother say that gay people can change if they want to.) I want to be brave, and I know the world is better now for gay men and lesbians. But I don’t want to be thrown out of the house. What should I do? G.G. Courage is not just running blindly into burning buildings. Sometimes, it’s living to fight another day. Trust your instincts. You, your friend and I probably all suspect that you will be happier when you are free to live honestly. But that may not be this instant. Right now, you exist in a weird bubble at the tail-end of childhood: old enough to know your heart, but still dependent on your parents for food and shelter. Wait until you can come out safely, whether that’s when you graduate from high school or later, if your parents plan to help with college expenses. Today is a better time for most L.G.B.T. people than ever before. But not for all of us. Let’s not forget that the Republican Party nodded to “gay conversion therapy” (which your mom may also advocate) in its platform — which is meanspirited, morally wrong and dangerous.
fashion,You are perfect just the way you are, G.G. No need to change (or come out) to please your mother or your best friend, though both may think they know what’s best for you. Come out on your timetable. And if you need to talk, call me or the Trevor Project. The calls will be confidential, and talking to someone who has been there can really help. I own an antique-clothing store. I can’t have food, drinks or pets in the shop. Too much merchandise has been ruined. (I’ll spare you the shopper with the wet Rottweiler and toddler with ice cream.) I have posted a variety of signs, but customers ignore them. How can I encourage people to act with more respect? VIVAN, FLORIDA As (nearly) anyone with a delicious pistachio ice cream cone will tell you, we understand the reason for your rules, but we can’t believe they apply to us or that we could possibly make a mess — until we do. Signs alone are too passive. Friendly vigilance is required. (I stress “friendly” because people who have been snapped at rarely buy vintage Pucci trousers.) Say: “I’m sorry, but food and drink aren’t allowed. Can you leave your iced coffee at the counter until you’re finished shopping?” If they refuse, ask them to come back later. Same with pet owners: Offer to mind their Pomeranians or give them a shopping rain check.
fashion,I am a department manager and share an office with an assistant. His job performance is fine, but he has pervasive daily body odor. Sharing a small, enclosed space with him is almost too much to bear. I am usually comfortable giving my employees constructive criticism, but I am at a loss for how to handle this without shaming him. ALEXANDRA, NEW YORK Good job on pausing before acting here. Commenting on the way other people look or sound or smell is always sensitive business. Even well-intentioned remarks can hurt. And in the workplace, they can be legally actionable. If you have a human resources department, consult it. If not, speak with your employee directly and professionally. (No cutesy anonymous notes or roll-on deodorant sticks left on his chair.) Be mindful, too, that his odor may stem from a medical condition. Say: “I’m pleased with the quality of your work, David. But I’m concerned about your body odor, which makes it difficult to work with you. Are you aware of it?” Depending on his reply, suggest more-frequent bathing or clothes laundering or perhaps a trip to his doctor. By handling this in “no big deal” fashion, you may make it no big deal. I hired the catering arm of a barbecue restaurant to feed 100 guests at my wedding. Despite meticulous planning, the service was subpar: Sides were served before entrees, they forgot to bring the beer and there weren’t enough ribs to go around. My mother and I are mortified. It was an expensive affair, but the caterer’s mistakes made us look stingy. Should I offer apologies for the meal in my thank-you letters?
fashion,JULIA, NEW YORK If it makes you feel better, why not? But don’t bury the lede. The main reason you are thanking these folks is for sharing your milestone day. (By the way, congratulations!) They may also have given gifts for which you are grateful. So, noting bad service at the reception (while infuriating) is pretty low on your note-writing agenda. Can you limit yourself to one swipe amid a bouquet of gratitude? “We wish the caterer had been better organized, but we are so thankful to you,” etc.
sports/baseball,For Perhaps the Last Time, the Royals Are Going for It All, Together - The New York Times BOSTON — Mike Moustakas was out of the Kansas City Royals’ lineup Sunday, on the eve of the nonwaiver trading deadline. Under different circumstances, this might have been alarming. Moustakas is approaching free agency, and his breakout season — including 30 home runs so far — will most likely price him out of the Royals’ range. But there was no hug watch here at Fenway Park. There were no cameras trained on Moustakas waiting to capture his farewell hugs with teammates. He was taking a routine day off to rest his legs after an extra-inning slog the night before. The Royals indeed made a trade on Sunday, but not to subtract. They added a veteran outfielder, Melky Cabrera, by shipping two Class A pitchers to the Chicago White Sox. “Early in the season, everyone was saying we should sell and get rid of everybody,” said Moustakas, an All-Star third baseman. “Now we’re at the deadline, and we’re all together — and we’re, what, two or three games out? And we’re in the wild-card hunt. All we need is a chance, all we need is some life, and we’re a dangerous team.” The Royals had won nine games in a row through Friday, and they stood at 55-48 after Sunday’s 5-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox. They lead in the race for the second American League wild-card spot, and they trail Cleveland by two games in the Central division. They have made a thorough recovery from a troubling start.
sports/baseball,After finishing April with nine losses in a row, the Royals fell to 10-20 in early May. Around that time, Manager Ned Yost called a meeting with his veterans. The guts of the team — Moustakas, first baseman Eric Hosmer, center fielder Lorenzo Cain and shortstop Alcides Escobar — are all eligible for free agency after this season. Yost asked if they were worried about their contracts. Not at all, the players said. But they were frustrated by playing so poorly. They did not want to squander their last chance to win as teammates. “We all know the situation, we all know we’re gonna be free agents at the end of the year, we understand that,” Cain said. “I don’t think anyone’s going up there saying, ‘We need to do this or that.’ But it’s a meeting that needed to be held. We needed to sit down and talk and try to figure out a game plan to turn things around. We didn’t do it right away, but we continued to get stronger together.” The Royals have won 33 of 51 games since June 1, the second-best record in the majors in that span. The only team to do better is the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have gone 29 years since their last World Series appearance. If that sounds familiar, it could be because that was the same drought the Royals endured before 2014, when they swept through the A.L. playoffs.
sports/baseball,That season ended with a one-run loss to the San Francisco Giants in Game 7 of the World Series, but the Royals staged a stirring follow-up against the Mets in 2015. While the Mets led for more innings of that World Series, the Royals won in five games, underscoring their resilience. Even after a .500 finish last season, the front office would not give up on a group like that. “That’s the way we feel,” Yost said. “They earned it. They built a legacy here, and we want to give them one more chance to finish it out together.” General Manager Dayton Moore did trade two veterans last winter, sending closer Wade Davis to the Chicago Cubs and outfielder Jarrod Dyson to the Seattle Mariners. Neither move has helped much yet, but Moore said he never seriously considered dealing his core stars. The Royals had already passed up their best chance for a strong return on trades. “If you were going to maximize value of our free agents, the time to do that would have been after the ’15 season, when they had two years of control left,” Moore said. “That’s when you’re going to strike really good deals. Well, we’d just won a World Series. We simply were not going to do that. And there was no reason to do that, because you’re trying to continue to win, be a special part of the history of the game.”
sports/baseball,Moore joined the Royals in 2006, devising a plan to build around speed and defense to fit a spacious home stadium and a modest budget. He has executed the strategy with patience, discipline and a deep sense of duty to the players. In December 2012 — after the Royals’ ninth losing season in a row — he sent four top prospects to Tampa Bay for Davis and a top starter, James Shields. Moore was widely criticized for that deal, but he said he owed it to the players to show faith in their progress. They responded, and appreciate the continuing support. Sunday’s deal was Moore’s second in a week; he also acquired pitchers Ryan Buchter, Trevor Cahill and Brandon Maurer from the San Diego Padres last Monday. “That’s what everybody loves about Dayton,” Cain said. “He’s never given up on us. He’s always believed in us, and he’s stayed strong to his word.” The players showed the same traits on Sunday, trailing in the eighth inning and storming ahead with a four-run rally, capped by an Alex Gordon triple. Later, they watched on television as Matt Davidson of the White Sox hit a homer to beat the Indians, nudging the Royals closer to first. The clubhouse erupted in cheers. The Royals are going for it again, together, one last time. “If we’re struggling and we’re not really in it as a team, it’s easier for guys to think about maybe leaving or getting traded away,” Hosmer said. “But we’ve put ourselves in a position where we’re all in the same boat individually. We’re all fighting towards a pennant right now, so it’s easy to put that stuff past you.”
style,Review/Fashion; How the Offbeat Slips Into the Mainstream - The New York Times It has been fondled by Tom Ford, turned over and admired by Miuccia Prada and now -- it was bound to happen given all the routine encounters -- this writer's little black bag has been copied by Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton. Salvatore Ferragamo, the maker of the year-old clutch bag with a turn-lock closure in stainless steel, ought to demand royalties. When Mr. Jacobs said in a note that he had been inspired by the bag when he saw it backstage last month at his own show in New York, one wondered if he would actually produce something like it for Vuitton. And he did -- not an exact copy; he fudged a few details. But the similarities were there, and there was nothing flattering or amusing about it. In this business, and perhaps in art and music as well, you aren't supposed to take copying seriously, because it's rampant. Everyone does it. And because of the commercial pressures on designers like Mr. Jacobs to produce several collections a year, the ways in which they lift ideas have become as ingenious as they are sly. Take for instance the maribou pompoms that appeared as sex-pot adornment on chaste wool coats in Mr. Jacobs's show today, and on shoes in Christian Lacroix's collection on Sunday. Just how did those two wildly different designers happen to latch onto something as offbeat as pompoms? By looking to someone in the margins of fashion -- most likely, Yvan Mispelaere, the designer at Féraud. His haute couture collections of the last two seasons were so loaded with girlish frippery, like button embroidery and round Peter Pan collars, that they were quickly dismissed as amateur.
style,But that's how fashion works today. A design assistant, with connections to stylists and photographers, picks up on a new style and takes it back to the mother ship -- namely, the big luxury houses that have to churn out lots of merchandise. Many of Mr. Jacobs's Empire dresses and coats, scattered with buttons or sweetened with rippling collars, looked great, especially if you don't know or mind that the silhouette is an old Patou one that Mr. Mispelaere was toying around with six months ago. As for Mr. Lacroix, his show was such a confusion of some truly marvelous gems, like a shirtdress lacquered with square ruby paillettes, and some atrocious examples of bad taste (a video of a woman wearing pasties and writhing a good deal played in the background) that it was just hard to follow. With so much casual lifting -- even the inventive Dutch team of Viktor & Rolf depended on the silhouettes of Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent to pull off their brilliant conceptual show Saturday -- the French fall 2001 collections have hit a snag. At least Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons kept her head on, proving with naughty slip dresses, flaring crinolines and conical bra tops strapped over manly jackets that she can take apart the current obsession for underpinnings, and still say something new.
style,Jurgi Persoons's presentation was held Friday night next to a couple of motor coaches parked in the subterranean garage of the Pompidou Center, where a Pop Art retrospective sponsored by Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci opens Tuesday night with the usual supersmooth crowd bussing everyone in sight. Being in the basement has its symbolic meaning -- one must start somewhere -- as well its aesthetic value. Mr. Persoons's clothes, worn by models lying like cadavers on 18 separate slanting mirrors, are for fashion's underground. Rough around the edges, in humble fabrics like cotton and wool herringbone, they are for people in flight from the banality of  brand culture. Yet, despite his moody colors and inert models, Mr. Persoons is no rebel sad sack. Full skirts, including one blossoming with starchy rows of tiny ruffles, suggest an oddball exuberance that was quieted by a plain cotton shirt. Mr. Persoons is Belgian and shares with lowland masters a taste for frumpy severity. But caught in the reflection of the mirrors was a gridlock of girders, an ingenious way for a young designer to evoke the modern horizon. One hears the word cult applied to fashion all the time -- the cult of chic, the cult of Prada. But the cult of dung? This is a new thing. Bernhard Willhelm's show on Sunday night, held in a neighborhood renowned for  peep shows, used the dung-gathering rituals of the scarab beetle as a theme, as spelled out in the program notes. For him, that meant striped Egyptian tunics and pants, the odd white-robed empress (presumably of the heap), and, stuck to the models' foreheads, a gnarled golden-brown ball that looked like a giant piece of dung.
style,Well, all right. Mr. Willhelm has his whimsies. Here there was a prim white blouse with sleeves exploding like roses, there a chemise printed with densely packed blocks, each containing a person's name. It was like looking at an ambulatory display of those novelty license plates you find at highway service stations. Or a list of cult members. But exactly. The cigarette haze at Martine Sitbon's show on Sunday in one of those ratty avant-garde dives gave the clothes a certain Charlotte Rampling romance, as black jackets with peaked shoulders or puffed sleeves came out over taut minis or glossy black bias skirts. She made subtle but imaginative use of corset hooks, and black leather with gauzy yarn insets displayed a resolutely female sensibility that fans of Ms. Sitbon admire. But she seemed to lose interest halfway through, ending on a bland note of wispy chiffon and taupe jersey. Cocktails were served before Josephus Thimister's show, held on a squishy carpet of trampled carnations in a night club, and you had to wonder if the drinks were a form of attitude adjustment to prepare for the heavy weather the audience was about to face. There was a lot to like in the collection -- an olive military coat tossed over the shoulders of a sternly belted suit in buff leather, a shearling top with a cape effect in the back, and a slithery black evening sweater, with fur worked loosely into one shoulder, pulled over a narrow opaque skirt. But Mr. Thimister needs to let go of the weepy rock ballads, and this rather depleted Teutonic sense of femininity -- as absorbed from 1970's movies or Helmut Newton photographs -- and breathe some fresh air.
style,At Hermès, staff members were treating lightly press queries about whether Jil Sander was in negotiations to replace Martin Margiela as the house designer. Mr. Margiela has his detractors, who yawn at the thought of another cashmere wrap coat or shapeless jumper for the antifashion rich. But it would be hard to fault the collection he showed on Sunday -- white leather shirts that even from a distance of a few feet looked like cotton, the rustic goatskin coats  and slouchy gray pantsuits that Ms. Sander herself would respect.
business/dealbook,Kik Raises $50 Million From Tencent, in Bid to Become ‘WeChat of the West’ - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Kik has long aspired to become the Western world’s equivalent of WeChat, the hugely popular Chinese messaging app that lets users book taxis, send payments — and also talk with their friends. Now Kik has secured an investment from WeChat’s parent company. The service announced on Tuesday that it had collected $50 million in new capital from Tencent, the Chinese Internet giant that created WeChat four years ago. The investment values Kik at $1 billion. “We said we wanted to be the WeChat of the West,” Ted Livingston, Kik’s founder and chief executive, said in an interview. “To have WeChat come in and say, ‘Yep, we think you can do it,’ is very satisfying.” The move is the latest by a major Western messaging service in the hopes of growing to become the next big Internet force. Companies like Kik, Viber and Tango have sought to ride the wave of popularity that propelled WhatsApp to a $21.8 billion sale to Facebook and buoyed the valuation of Snapchat to $15 billion. Among those messaging apps, Kik has been the most vocal about becoming the kind of Internet hub that WeChat has evolved into in China. Founded in January 2011, WeChat now lets users send image-laden messages, play games and buy plane tickets.
business/dealbook,To Mr. Livingston, that has meant, in part, catching younger users. Kik now claims that 40 percent of American teenagers use its app, and that 70 percent of its 240 million registered users are between 13 and 24 years old. Getting users early on means that they will be more comfortable using a service like Kik as a way to not only send messages, but also use add-on services. Already, the company has introduced new offerings like messages built on GIFs, the increasingly prolific animated images that now litter the Web. It’s a similar approach, Mr. Livingston said, to how WeChat served as a gateway for many first-time Chinese Internet users — and then added more and more features to keep those people coming back. Though Kik and WeChat have known each other for some time, the investment grew out of a strategic review process that the Western app began in the spring with the help of Qatalyst Partners, the Silicon Valley boutique investment bank. Kik also weighed other options, including a sale of itself, but it favored an investment. Taking money from a like-minded Chinese counterpart simply made sense, according to Mr. Livingston. With the new money, Kik will focus on growing and adding new offerings for its app, Mr. Livingston said. It also will help the company build revenue, which it has started collecting through initiatives like Kik Points, where users can garner rewards by visiting sites, taking surveys or joining services from partners.
world/middleeast,Egypt Erupts in Jubilation as Mubarak Steps Down - The New York Times CAIRO — An 18-day-old revolt led by the young people of Egypt ousted President Hosni Mubarak on Friday, shattering three decades of political stasis here and overturning the established order of the Arab world. Shouts of “God is great” erupted from Tahrir Square at twilight as Mr. Mubarak’s vice president and longtime intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, announced that Mr. Mubarak had passed all authority to a council of military leaders. Tens of thousands who had bowed down for evening prayers leapt to their feet, bouncing and dancing in joy. “Lift your head high, you’re an Egyptian,” they cried. Revising the tense of the revolution’s rallying cry, they chanted, “The people, at last, have brought down the regime.” “We can breathe fresh air, we can feel our freedom,” said Gamal Heshamt, a former independent member of Parliament. “After 30 years of absence from the world, Egypt is back.” Mr. Mubarak, an 82-year-old former air force commander, left without comment for his home by the Red Sea in Sharm el Sheik. His departure overturns, after six decades, the Arab world’s original secular dictatorship. He was toppled by a radically new force in regional politics — a largely secular, nonviolent, youth-led democracy movement that brought Egypt’s liberal and Islamist opposition groups together for the first time under its banner. One by one the protesters withstood each weapon in the arsenal of the Egyptian autocracy — first the heavily armed riot police, then a ruling party militia and finally the state’s powerful propaganda machine.
world/middleeast,Mr. Mubarak’s fall removed a bulwark of American foreign policy in the region. The United States, its Arab allies and Israel are now pondering whether the Egyptian military, which has vowed to hold free elections, will give way to a new era of democratic dynamism or to a perilous lurch into instability or Islamist rule. The upheaval comes less than a month after a sudden youth revolt in nearby Tunisia toppled another enduring Arab strongman, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. And on Friday night some of the revelers celebrating in the streets of Cairo marched under a Tunisian flag and pointed to the surviving autocracies in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Yemen. “We are setting a role model for the dictatorships around us,” said Khalid Shaheen, 39. “Democracy is coming.” President Obama, in a televised address, praised the Egyptian revolution. “Egyptians have made it clear that nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day,” he said. “It was the moral force of nonviolence — not terrorism and mindless killing — that bent the arc of history toward justice once more.” The Muslim Brotherhood, the outlawed Islamist movement that until 18 days ago was considered Egypt’s only viable opposition, said it was merely a supporting player in the revolt. “We participated with everyone else and did not lead this or raise Islamic slogans so that it can be the revolution of everyone,” said Mohamed Saad el-Katatni, a spokesman for the Brotherhood. “This is a revolution for all Egyptians; there is no room for a single group’s slogans, not the Brotherhood’s or anybody else.”
world/middleeast,The Brotherhood, which was slow to follow the lead of its own youth wing into the streets, has said it will not field a candidate for president or seek a parliamentary majority in the expected elections. The Mubarak era ended without any of the stability and predictability that were the hallmarks of his tenure. Western and Egyptian officials had expected Mr. Mubarak to leave office on Thursday and irrevocably delegate his authority to Vice President Suleiman, finishing the last six months of his term with at least his presidential title intact. But whether because of pride or stubbornness, Mr. Mubarak instead spoke once again as the unbowed father of the nation, barely alluding to a vague “delegation” of authority. The resulting disappointment enraged the Egyptian public, sent a million people into the streets of Cairo on Friday morning and put in motion an unceremonious retreat at the behest of the military he had commanded for so long. “Taking into consideration the difficult circumstances the country is going through, President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak has decided to leave the post of president of the republic and has tasked the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to manage the state’s affairs,” Mr. Suleiman, grave and ashen, said in a brief televised statement. It is now not clear what role Mr. Suleiman, whose credibility plummeted over the past week as he stood by Mr. Mubarak and even questioned Egypt’s readiness for democracy, will have in the new government.
world/middleeast,The transfer of power leaves the Egyptian military in charge of this nation of 85 million, facing insistent calls for fundamental democratic change and open elections. Hours before Mr. Suleiman announced Mr. Mubarak’s exit, the military had signaled its takeover with a communiqué that appeared to declare its solidarity with the protesters. Read on state television by an army spokesman, the communiqué declared that the military — not Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Suleiman or any other civilian authority — would ensure the amendment of the Constitution to “conduct free and fair presidential elections.” “The armed forces are committed to sponsor the legitimate demands of the people,” the statement declared, and the military promised to ensure the fulfillment of its promises “within defined time frames” until authority could be passed to a “free democratic community that the people aspire to.” It pledged to remove the reviled “emergency law,” which allows the government to detain anyone without charges or trial, “as soon as the current circumstances are over” and further promised immunity from prosecution for the protesters, whom it called “the honest people who refused the corruption and demanded reforms.” Egyptians ignored the communiqué, as they have most official pronouncements of the Mubarak government, until the president’s resignation was announced. Then they hugged, kissed and cheered the soldiers, lifting children on tanks to get their pictures taken. “The people and the army are one hand,” they chanted.
world/middleeast,Standing guard near the presidential palace, soldiers passed photographs of “martyrs” killed during the revolution through barbed wire to attach them to their tanks. At Tahrir Square, some slipped out of position to join the roaring crowds flooding the streets. Whether the military will subordinate itself to a civilian democracy or install a new military dictator will be impossible to know for months. Military leaders will inevitably face pressure to deliver the genuine transition that protesters did not trust Mr. Mubarak to give them. Yet it may also seek to protect the enormous political and economic privileges it accumulated during Mr. Mubarak’s reign. And the army has itself been infused for years with the notion that Egypt’s survival depends on fighting threats, real and imagined, from foreign enemies, Islamists, Iran and the frustrations of its own people. Throughout the revolt, the army stood passively on the sidelines — its soldiers literally standing behind the iron fence of the Egyptian Museum — as the police or armed Mubarak loyalists fought the protesters centered in Tahrir Square. But Western diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were violating confidences, said that top army officials had told them that their troops would never use force against civilians, depriving Mr. Mubarak of a decisive tool to suppress the dissent. It has been “increasingly clear,” a Western diplomat said Friday, that “the army will not go down with Mubarak.”
world/middleeast,Now the military, which owns vast commercial interests here but has not fought in decades, must defuse demonstrations, quell widespread labor unrest and rebuild a shattered economy and security forces. Its top official, Field Marshal  Hussein Tantawi, 75, served for decades as a top official of Mr. Mubarak’s government. And its top uniformed official, Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, has not spoken publicly. Egypt’s opposition has said for weeks that it welcomed a military role in securing the country, ideally under a two- to five-member presidential council with only one military member. And the initial reaction to the military takeover was ecstatic. “Welcome back,” said Wael Ghonim, the Google executive who administered the Facebook group that helped start the revolt. Mr. Ghonim, who was detained for 12 days in blindfolded isolation by the Mubarak government as it tried to stamp out the revolt, helped protesters turn the tide in a propaganda war against the state media earlier this week, when he described his captivity in an emotional interview on a satellite television station. “Egypt is going to be a democratic state,” he declared Friday, in another interview. “You will be impressed.” Dr. Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, 32, a transplant surgeon who was among the small group of organizers who guided the revolution, said the leaders had decided to let the protests unwind on their own. “We are not going to ask the people to stay in the square or leave — it is their choice,” he said. “Even if they leave, any government will know that we can get them to the streets again in a minute.”
world/middleeast,“Our country never had a victory in our lifetime, and this is the sort of victory we were looking for, a victory over a vicious regime that we needed to bring down,” Dr. Harb said. Amr Ezz, 27, another of revolt’s young leaders, said that calling the revolution a military coup understated its achievement. “It is the people who took down the president and the regime and can take down anyone else,” he said. “Now the role of the regular people has ended and the role of the politicians begins. Now we can begin negotiations with the military in order to plan the coming phase.” The opposition groups participating in the protest movement had previously settled on a committee led by Mohamed ElBaradei, the former diplomat and Nobel laureate, to negotiate with the army if Mr. Mubarak resigned. Mr. ElBaradei could not be reached for comment on Friday, but in a television interview he indicated that he expected the talks with the military to begin within days. “I’d like to see that started tomorrow so we can have a sharing of power, the civilian and the military, and tell them what our demands are, what they need to do,” he said. By evening, Egyptian politicians were  beginning to position themselves to run for office. Amr Moussa, one of the country’s most popular public figures, resigned his position as secretary general of the Arab League, and an aide, Hesham Youssef, confirmed that Mr. Moussa was considering seeking office.
world/middleeast,In Switzerland, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had frozen possible assets of “the former Egyptian president” and his associates. In the military’s final communiqué of the day, its spokesman thanked Mr. Mubarak for his service and saluted the “martyrs” of the revolution. In Tahrir Square, protesters said they were not quite ready to disband the little republic they had built up during their two-week occupation, setting up makeshift clinics, soundstages, a detention center and security teams to protect the barricades. Many have boasted that their encampment was a rare example of community spirit here, and after Mr. Mubarak’s resignation the organizers called on the thousands who protested here to return once again on Saturday morning to help clean it up.
business/media,Roger Ailes, Who Built Fox News Into an Empire, Dies at 77 - The New York Times Roger E. Ailes, who shaped the images that helped elect three Republican presidents and then became a dominant, often-intimidating force in American conservative politics at the helm of Fox News until he was forced out last year in a sexual harassment scandal, died on Thursday morning. He was 77. The cause was complications of a subdural hematoma that Mr. Ailes sustained when he fell and struck his head on May 10 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., the local authorities said. “Fair and balanced” was Mr. Ailes’s defining phrase for Fox News, along with another slogan: “We report. You decide.” Though routinely mocked by liberal critics, who regarded the network as decidedly unfair and imbalanced, those words amounted to an article of faith for Mr. Ailes, who created Fox News with Rupert Murdoch’s money and guided it for two decades. “If we look conservative,” he said, “it’s because the other guys are so far to the left.” In his mordant humor, CNN stood for Clinton News Network and CBS for Communist Broadcasting System. What Fox News did, he said, was apply a necessary corrective. From its debut on Oct. 7, 1996, the network, under his tutelage, did its share of straightforward reporting but also unmistakably filtered major news stories through a conservative lens. Evening programming, which embodied the Fox News brand, was dominated by right-wing commentators like Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity, who hurled opinions and vented resentments with a pugnacity that reflected their boss’s own combativeness.
business/media,As the network’s chairman and chief executive, Mr. Ailes was widely feared, particularly by conservative politicians who sought his favor. He cultivated a swaggering persona, accentuated by bursts of obscenity-laced anger. Once, he became so enraged that he punched a hole in the wall of a control room. “I don’t ignore anything,” he acknowledged in a 2003 profile in The New Yorker. “Somebody gets in my face, I get in their face.” Years earlier, Lee Atwater, whose remorseless approach to politics matched that of Mr. Ailes when they worked together on George H.W. Bush’s 1988 presidential campaign, described his colleague as having “two speeds: attack and destroy.” Both speeds were evident at the Ailes-run Fox News. For loyal viewers, it was the network of choice to hear repeatedly about the moral failings of Bill and Hillary Clinton, questions about Barack Obama’s birthplace, doubts about the patriotism of American Muslims, grumblings about the war ostensibly being waged on Christmas, and warnings about “death panels” that would supposedly flourish under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Fox News embraced the American flag as if it were its own, then became an uninhibited booster of the Iraq War and an unabashed critic of those who opposed it. The network also made itself a haven for Republicans who had fallen from political grace and hoped to restart their careers, among them Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum. Mr. Hannity’s show was effectively a public-relations vehicle for one presidential candidate who made it to the top: Donald J. Trump.
business/media,Even more than he embraced political combat, Mr. Ailes keenly understood television and its reliance on attention-grabbing flourishes. He learned the medium’s emotional impact in the 1960s as the young producer of “The Mike Douglas Show,” a syndicated daytime variety program. To hold people’s interest, “you have to be punchy and graphic in your conversation,” he wrote in a 1988 book, “You Are the Message.” He put that instinct to effective use, and to personal profit, after he left the Douglas show in 1968 to devote himself to political stagecraft. Across more than two decades, he devised media strategies for several dozen political campaigns, including the winning presidential candidacies of Richard M. Nixon in 1968, Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Mr. Bush in 1988. In 2016, he informally advised the triumphant Trump campaign. At Mr. Ailes’s Fox, the news was delivered with eye-catching graphics and whooshing sound effects. Female broadcasters tended to be attractive blondes encouraged to show more than a little leg. “Look, there’s a certain element of the melding with show business or entertainment,” he told Broadcasting & Cable magazine in 2003. “Entertainment and news should always be separate, but you should walk right up to the line and get your toe on it.” His methods served the network well. In January 2002, barely five years after its birth, Fox passed the well-established CNN as the most-watched cable news network. It stayed No. 1, reinforcing Mr. Ailes’s political influence. Power made him anxious about his personal safety. Convinced that enemies like Al Qaeda had him in their cross hairs, he installed elaborate security measures at work and at home.
business/media,At the end of his tenure, the network had an average daily viewership of 2 million, more than CNN and the left-leaning MSNBC combined. Its audience skewed white, male and old, the median age approaching 70. But they were passionate viewers. Their fidelity produced billion-dollar profits and made Fox News an indispensable component of the Murdoch empire, 21st Century Fox. In a statement on Thursday morning, Mr. Murdoch said Mr. Ailes “will be remembered by the many people on both sides of the camera that he discovered, nurtured and promoted.” “Roger and I shared a big idea, which he executed in a way no one else could have,” he added. “In addition, Roger was a great patriot who never ceased fighting for his beliefs.” Although an Ailes admirer, Mr. Murdoch reluctantly concluded in the summer of 2016 that his news chief had to go after a former network anchor, Gretchen Carlson, brought a lawsuit charging Mr. Ailes with sexual harassment. Her action set in motion a cascade of allegations from women, who reported unwanted groping and demands for sex by him. Some of them described an overall culture of misogyny at Fox News. The scandal enveloped the network’s top star, Bill O’Reilly, whose employment was abruptly ended last month. Mr. O’Reilly denied the charges of sexual impropriety, as did Mr. Ailes. But Mr. Ailes was finished at Fox, and walked away with a payout reportedly worth $40 million.
business/media,Those were not the first accusations of their kind. They went back at least to the early 1990s, when Mr. Ailes returned to television full time, producing a show for the conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh and a separate late-night talk show on NBC. As recounted in “The Loudest Voice in the Room,” Gabriel Sherman’s 2014 biography of Mr. Ailes, a female producer looking to work for him at NBC said he had offered her an extra $100 a week “if you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.” In 1993, Mr. Ailes took charge of the CNBC business news network and a second NBC cable channel, America’s Talking (which gave way in 1996 to MSNBC). As he would later do at Fox, he turned the struggling CNBC into a financial success and won the loyalty of employees, who had at first viewed him warily. But after a falling out with NBC chieftains over programming control, he quit in 1995. Almost immediately he called on Mr. Murdoch, who longed for a news network of his own and shared Mr. Ailes’s belief that existing news organizations were far too liberal. They created Fox News in fairly short order. Eventually, dozens of seasoned NBC employees joined them. With characteristic bite, Mr. Ailes described their defection as “a jailbreak.” Roger Eugene Ailes was born on May 15, 1940, in Warren, Ohio, a blue-collar town near Youngstown. His father, Robert, was a foreman at the Packard Electric Company, and his mother, Donna, a housewife who brought in extra money by embroidering handkerchiefs for sale. Theirs was a rocky marriage. His father was known for abusiveness.
business/media,Found to have hemophilia as a child, Roger more than once nearly bled to death, as when he fell and bit his tongue at age 2. (Mr. Ailes had also been bleeding heavily when paramedics found him on a bathroom floor at his home on May 10, the police said. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner’s office said his hemophilia had contributed to his death.) Assorted maladies plagued Mr. Ailes through life. He dealt with blood-pooling around the joints and, in time, developed arthritis and severe weight problems. Despite the ailments, or perhaps because of them, he did not shy from physical contact, whether digging ditches as a teenager or getting into occasional fistfights. Even after politics and television had made him a rich man, he reveled in portraying himself as a working-class tough guy. That sensibility, and a disdain for most journalists, infused his network’s news coverage. “I’ve had a broad life experience that doesn’t translate into going to the Columbia Journalism School,” he said. “That makes me a lot better journalist than some guys who had to listen to some pathetic professor who has been on the public dole all his life and really doesn’t like this country much.” Mr. Ailes’s interest in broadcasting was ignited at Ohio University, in Athens, where he worked on the college radio station before graduating in 1962.
business/media,There, he met Marjorie White, the first of his three wives. Their 17-year marriage ended in 1977. His second wife was Norma Ferrer, a television producer, but that union ended, too, in 1995, after 14 years. His third wife, Elizabeth Tilson, was a program director at CNBC. They were married in 1998 at New York’s City Hall in a ceremony presided over by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former Ailes political client. In 2000, with the birth of a son, Zachary, Mr. Ailes became a first-time father at nearly 60. His survivors include his wife and son as well as an older brother, Dr. Robert J. Ailes. After college, Mr. Ailes started out as a production assistant on “The Mike Douglas Show,” which was then based in Cleveland. He rose swiftly, becoming executive producer at 28. A turning point for him came in early 1968, when Nixon went on the show as his presidential campaign took form. Wary of television — convinced that he had lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy on the basis of appearances — Nixon dismissed it in a conversation with Mr. Ailes as a “gimmick.” “Television is not a gimmick,” Mr. Ailes said boldly, “and if you think it is, you’ll lose again.” Nixon took those words to heart, and took the young man onto his campaign as a media adviser. Mr. Ailes strove to make Nixon more likable — no simple task — giving him a makeover that included town hall-style sessions with carefully screened audiences that asked easy questions and allowed the candidate to seem assured.
business/media,In the 1970s, Mr. Ailes set up shop in New York, where he solidified his growing reputation as a master of bare-knuckled politics. Even then, he had visions of a right-of-center network, and played an important role in developing Television News Inc., or TVN, a news service financed by the ardently conservative Joseph Coors, of the beer-making family. Its slogan was one that would ring loudly years later: “fair and balanced.” TVN distributed news clips with a conservative slant to television networks and local stations. But it did not truly get off the ground, and collapsed in 1975 after two years. In that era Mr. Ailes also flirted with the theater world, producing a few Off Broadway shows. An initial effort, an ecologically themed musical called “Mother Earth,” flopped. But he enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with “The Hot l Baltimore,” a Lanford Wilson play about down-and-outers. As a campaign strategist, Mr. Ailes helped elect powerful Republican senators like Mitch McConnell, Phil Gramm and Alfonse M. D’Amato. But his most notable work was at the presidential level. When Mr. Reagan floundered for a while in his 1984 re-election campaign, Mr. Ailes coached him in ways to appear sharper in a televised debate and to display his innate affability. Four years later, the aggressive Ailes approach kicked into high gear in the presidential campaign of the elder George Bush. He coaxed Mr. Bush into sounding tough, to dispel a so-called wimp factor that hung over the candidate like a dark cloud.
business/media,That was the campaign of the notorious Willie Horton commercial. It focused on a black man who had raped a woman and assaulted her husband while free on a prison-furlough program in Massachusetts that was supported by the Democratic candidate, Michael S. Dukakis. The ad was widely attacked as blatantly racist, but it appeared to work as a vote magnet for Mr. Bush. Mr. Ailes claimed he had nothing to do with the commercial. Nonetheless, he told Time magazine in 1988 that “the only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it.” He later said he was joking. Reflecting on his career as a political operative, he insisted that he had not been motivated by a right-wing agenda. “People think I stayed in politics because I wanted conservatives to run the world,” he told The New York Times Magazine in 1995. “Actually, it was the money.” Yet he clung to conservative politics even in the quiet setting of Garrison, N.Y., where he and his wife bought property in 2001, across the Hudson River from the United States Military Academy. In 2008 the couple purchased a sleepy community newspaper, The Putnam County News and Recorder, and, with Ms. Ailes as publisher, turned it into a blunt instrument of conservative thought. They sold the paper toward the end of 2016. They bought their Palm Beach home last fall for a reported $36 million.
business/media,Mr. Ailes relished his reputation as a battler. Take the time he punched that hole in the wall. “It was just a drywall, and luckily I didn’t hit any beams,” he told Zev Chafets, author of the biography “Roger Ailes: Off Camera.” “But somebody,” he said, “put a frame around the hole and wrote, ‘Don’t mess with Roger Ailes.’ ”
business/international,VW’s Emissions-Test Trickery May Not Be Illegal in Europe - The New York Times LONDON — Four years ago, European auto regulators identified and debated a loophole in their pollution testing rules that could render vehicle emissions tests ineffectual, but it was ultimately left in place, internal documents show. The loophole lets carmakers change the performance settings of their engines before a pollution test. “A manufacturer could specify a special setting that is not normally used for everyday driving,” British regulators warned, according to minutes of a 2011 meeting in Geneva of officials across the region. The debate throws new light on Volkswagen’s costly emissions cheating — particularly the question of whether VW violated European testing rules. In September, Volkswagen admitted to installing “defeat device” software in 11 million cars, programming them to detect when they were being tested for nitrogen oxide emissions. The result was a substantial reduction in emissions. Volkswagen made the admission, after deceiving regulators in the United States for several months, in the face of an inquiry. But the same practice may be legal in Europe. While defeat devices are ostensibly banned in Europe as well as the United States, Paul Willis, a top Volkswagen official in Europe, said in a letter published this week that the company was still considering “whether the software in question officially constituted a defeat device” under European Union regulations.
business/international,And Lucia Caudet, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Union’s executive branch, said in an email that the commission had “no formal view on whether” the vehicles sold in the United States were “equipped with a ‘defeat device’ in the E.U. legal sense or not.” She added that investigations of vehicles sold in Europe “are still ongoing, so we cannot provide an assessment on the nature of the devices used at this stage.” The Volkswagen scandal has put Europe’s permissive testing practices in the spotlight, and has raised questions about the compatibility of American and European auto regulations. Trans-Atlantic trade talks are underway, and the objectives include fostering mutual recognition of auto regulations. Regulations that apply in Europe say “the settings of the engine and of the vehicle’s controls shall be those prescribed by the manufacturer.” If manufacturers have the discretion to determine their own engine settings during emissions tests in Europe, it remains unclear if using software to alter engine settings would violate European rules. Most of the roughly 11 million vehicles that Volkswagen has said carry the software are in Europe. About 500,000 vehicles are in the United States, and others are scattered across the globe. Billions of dollars could hinge on whether the company’s emissions software was technically a defeat device in Europe. Penalties for use of the devices are left to member states, though enforcement by auto regulators in Europe is rare.
business/international,The answer could also weigh on litigation. David Standard, a spokesman for Leigh Day, a product liability law firm based in London, said the firm had taken in more than 8,000 potential Volkswagen-related claims and VW “could be looking at the largest-ever consumer legal action in U.K. history.” Volkswagen has committed itself to fixing the vehicles. In Britain, one of the company’s largest markets, VW says it will fix all of the affected vehicles by the end of 2016. Some may require modifications beyond rewriting software code. Many regulators and public officials in Europe were hesitant to discuss how the system worked in Europe, and offered conflicting accounts of what happened after the British proposed to tighten the engine-settings regulations in 2011. Different engine configurations can produce substantially different tailpipe emissions. A “sports” setting can emphasize more power and less fuel and pollution efficiency. An “eco” setting can do the opposite. Or a car can default to an in-between setting for everyday driving. Britain’s proposal would have required that tests be performed on the default setting or the setting with the worst emissions. While it was supported by most of the national regulators, the proposal ultimately languished and was dropped from the agenda of regulators at their meetings by last year. Britain’s transport ministry said its own certifications required automakers to test vehicles on the default or worst emissions setting. In a statement, the ministry said the proposal “was supported and agreed” to by other European regulators, “ensuring a consistent approach to the laboratory testing.”
business/international,Ms. Caudet was a bit less definitive, saying that “European legislation implies that a vehicle must use the same engine setting during the regulatory emission test and in real driving.” And Sinead O’Donnell, a spokeswoman for Ireland’s auto testing agency, said her country had supported Britain’s position, but she added that “any change must await a decision of the legislative body” and current regulation “contains the same provision unchanged.” The Volkswagen investigation continues to reveal divergences in American and European regulations. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency, with regulators in California and Canada, said they had discovered that Volkswagen had used another defeat device in some larger cars and sport utility vehicles that had not previously been implicated. Volkswagen, whose brands include Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, has disputed that it intentionally sought to evade United States regulations in the latest finding. Mr. Willis, Volkswagen’s top official in Britain, wrote in a letter to the British Parliament that German regulators had concluded that the software used in these larger vehicles did not constitute a violation in Europe. In an email, Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority, known by its German initials K.B.A., said that for the larger vehicles implicated by the E.P.A. last week, “the findings that are available so far, and which are not complete yet, show no indication that an illegal defeat device is used.” The European system is known for its loopholes — for instance, allowing automakers to test preproduction vehicles that will never be sold and letting them strip out the back seats to make cars lighter and tape the doors and grilles to make them more aerodynamic.
business/international,But allowing manufacturers to determine engine settings is more fundamental to testing for pollution emissions. As the scandal unfolds, trade negotiators on both sides of the Atlantic have continued to work on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a sprawling trade agreement. Auto regulations have been considered a particularly fruitful target where the sides could agree to synchronize their rules. As the European Commission put it in a fact sheet early this year, there were no areas of controversy to hinder the discussions. “We’re not currently aware of any issues which are especially sensitive or where people have raised specific concerns,” the commission wrote. The Volkswagen scandal has made clear how fundamentally different the systems are, at least as related to emissions rules. Car regulation in Europe lacks central oversight. Automakers are permitted to have their vehicle fleets’ emissions certified by regulators in any of the 28 member states, and then they must be recognized by all the others. Policy makers in Brussels are also undercut by powerful member states like Germany protecting domestic automakers, critics say. While Europe plans to begin road testing of car pollution in 2017, those tests as now designed will have many of the same pitfalls as the lab tests. Among other things, manufacturers and their contractors will perform the tests with little regulatory oversight. The road tests are still subject to approval in the European Parliament, where frustration has been building. Volkswagen’s recent admission that it understated carbon dioxide emissions and overstated the fuel economy of 800,000 vehicles sold in Europe has added to that frustration.
business/international,“What we have developed is a phony system of testing where the member states are in competition with each other for who can make it the most easy for the car manufacturers to pass the test,” said Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, who lamented that European governments do not conduct random testing of their own, as the E.P.A. does. Mr. Gerbrandy is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a centrist bloc that assailed a recent move by the European government to make its forthcoming road emission tests easier to pass. “We have veto power here, and I would be surprised if we don’t use that,” Mr. Gerbrandy said. “Chances are high that Parliament will vote this down.”
world/americas,A Smuggled Girl’s Odyssey of False Promises and Fear - The New York Times EL PARAÍSO, Guatemala — The smugglers advertised on the radio as spring bloomed into summer: “Do you want to live better? Come with me.” Cecilia, a restless wisp of a girl, heard the pitch and ached to go. Her stepfather had been murdered, forcing her, her mother and four younger siblings into her aunt’s tiny home, with just three beds for 10 people. It was all they had — and all a smuggler needed. He offered them a loan of $7,000 for Cecilia’s journey, with the property as a guarantee. “I gave him the original deed,” said Jacinta, her aunt, noting that the smuggler gave them a year to repay the loan, with interest. “I did it out of love.” The trip lasted nearly a month, devolving from a journey of want and fear into an outright abduction by smugglers in the United States. Freedom came only after an extra $1,000 payment, made at a gas station in Fort Myers, Fla., as her kidnappers flashed a gun. Now in Miami, Cecilia, 16, is one of more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors who have come to the United States illegally from Central America in less than a year. Though the number of new arrivals has been declining, the Obama administration says it is determined to “confront the smugglers of these unaccompanied children,” and the “cartels who tax or exploit them in their passage.”
world/americas,But breaking up these networks will be difficult. Behind the surge of young migrants showing up for a shot at the American dream is a system of cruel and unregulated capitalism with a proven ability to adapt. The human export industry in the region is now worth billions of dollars, experts say, and it has become more ruthless and sophisticated than ever, employing a growing array of opportunists who trap, rape and rob from the point of departure to the end of the road. Thousands of migrants are believed to be kidnapped and abused every year while going through Mexico. Others, like Cecilia, are held for ransom in the United States, and officials across the region lament that the ugly business of human smuggling keeps getting uglier. Especially here in Guatemala, smugglers, or “coyotes,” have grown increasingly adept at marketing themselves to poor families, drumming up hopes with false depictions of American immigration policy, then squeezing their prey with death threats, demanding payment through bank loans or property titles. The result, visible throughout mountain villages like this one, is a relentless cycle with departures that ebb and flow but never seem to end. In this self-perpetuating system, the seeds of future migration have already been sown in the debts of the past and present. Cecilia’s inability to send money home right away led her pregnant mother to try to make the journey herself a few weeks later in a desperate bid to save the house, only to fail. Now she owes a coyote, too.
world/americas,Other family members will follow, her relatives say, repeating the pattern of debt, extortion and additional risk. One relative’s failure to cross the border or earn enough money up north prompts another departure, then another. “It’s a pyramid scheme,” said David Stoll, an anthropologist at Middlebury College who has studied migration in Guatemala. Once coyotes and families realize they are about to lose money or a house, he added, “the only way they can recoup their losses is by passing the game on to those below them.” Nebaj, the municipality that includes El Paraíso, sits in a small green valley deep in the Guatemala highlands, an eight-hour drive from the capital on rough roads that zigzag through lush canyons. This is the land of the Ixil, indigenous Mayans famous for weaving bright red skirts — and for being the victims of a scorched-earth military campaign that killed thousands in the 1980s during Guatemala’s civil war. The region has been sending people north for years, often with loans. In the hillside villages all over Nebaj, stories of land lost to coyotes and banks are common. Many families spend years struggling, with debts passed on like poisoned inheritances. Local lenders often lay out the initial payments. But if they are not paid back right away, they often threaten violence, forcing many families to borrow from Banrural, the main bank in rural Guatemala, or from cooperatives and credit unions, all of which happily advertise credit on billboards above the rural area’s muddy roads.
world/americas,Many families have come away with nothing more than regrets. “Sometimes I think my father just wasn’t thinking through the consequences of leaving,” Magdalena Raymundo, 25, said in a dirt-floored shack she shares with her husband in Acul, a village outside Nebaj. She and her mother still owe nearly $13,000 for a trip her father and brother took in 2006. Threatening to evict the family, “bank collectors come by every few weeks asking for money,” she said. Everyone here seems to know that going to the United States is a gamble with dangerous odds. But many go anyway because some win, and they tend to show it — like the owner of a new concrete house with an enormous American flag painted on the front, just a short walk down a muddy path from Ms. Raymundo’s home. The banking system encourages the risky behavior. Jorge Gúzman, the manager at one of two Banrural banks in Nebaj, said loans are more likely to be approved if the family applying has a relative up north sending back money. The loans are supposed to be for construction or farming improvements, but Mr. Gúzman said “most people are not honest about why they are borrowing.” He acknowledged that a lot of the money had been used to pay for additional journeys north. During the recession a few years ago, that led to more losses for the bank. But in the past year or two, he said, the bank’s portfolio had stabilized, allowing for more lending.
world/americas,And with more money in play, coyotes have come calling. Their ranks have multiplied, many here say, because it’s the best job around. One trip often pays more than a teacher’s annual salary. “This migration was prompted by a growing business, of the coyotes,” said Luis Fernando Carrera Castro, Guatemala’s foreign minister. “They saw a business opportunity, and they convinced people in Central America that somehow the laws of the United States were going to allow them to stay.” Their advertising in Nebaj could be heard openly on the radio. It could be seen in the market, where women in jeans handed out business cards with phone numbers for coyotes who came to town once or twice a week. Cecilia, who did not want her full name or the full names of her relatives used — to avoid trouble with American authorities and the people her family owes in Guatemala, knew the journey was risky. Her cousin, Ana, 21, who lives in the same house, had already tried and been deported, twice. But Cecilia and her family believed the smuggler’s proposal. “I thought when I got to the United States they would give me papers — the coyote said that,” she said. So early one morning in May, Cecilia put five pairs of pants and five shirts in a backpack and set off, walking up the dirt trail leading away from the home that paid her way. The coyote or one of his lackeys — they were all strangers, reachable only on cellphones that were shut off after two weeks — picked up Cecilia later that day, along with a half-dozen others.
world/americas,What followed, Cecilia said, was a five-leg, three-week journey with a rotating cast of opportunistic guides. First, she rode a bus to the Mexican border. Then another set of coyotes took them through Mexico, again by bus, often failing to give them any food — a common tool to maximize profit — until they reached the town of Reynosa, just across the border from McAllen, Tex. There, for about a week, she said, she was kept in a warehouse with as many as 100 people until they crossed the Rio Grande in a small boat and eventually landed at a house in or near McAllen. About 85 people, most of them men, squeezed into three bedrooms. The shades were drawn, and the new guides were gruff, rummaging through the migrants’ belongings while they slept. “They took all our money from us,” Cecilia said. She handed over her last 500 Mexican pesos (about $38). After about a week, another coyote took a small group to begin the treacherous walk through the desert in Brooks County to avoid the Border Patrol checkpoints on the roads. The thorns stuck to her legs. The dry air sapped her strength. “I saw two dead people in the desert,” she recalled. “There was hardly any food or water. The coyote had food for himself, but not for us.” At one point a car came and picked them up. They squeezed in, seven of them, and drove for an hour, following signs to Houston. The new coyote started calling her biological father, Jacinto, who had only recently reappeared in her life.
world/americas,“Where’s the money?” the coyote asked. Jacinto was confused. He had gone to the United States as a young man, working as a gardener in Miami, but had been back in Guatemala with a second family for more than a decade. “The man said if they don’t pay they are not going to let us out,” Cecilia said. It is a common scheme. Even as thousands of children have presented themselves to American border officials in recent months, many smugglers are holding onto others for extortion. In July, a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy was rescued from a Central Florida motel after a smuggler decided he wanted more money from his uncle and took off with the children in a van. The smuggler was later arrested. In March, 115 migrants were rescued from a stash house in Houston after a woman said she had paid a smuggler $15,000 to bring her daughter and two grandchildren to Chicago, but that they were being held against their will until an additional $13,000 was paid, according to a federal indictment. American law enforcement officials note that the culprits in these cases and others probably had nothing to do with the original smuggler the migrants signed up with. While a generation ago coyotes were typically local figures with trusted employees, smuggling is more decentralized now, making it easier to expand and harder to stop.
world/americas,“If this was hierarchal, you could take out the top, target the leadership, and it would be simple to take out the organization,” said Brian Moskowitz, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Houston. “Because it’s loose affiliations of cells and networks which form, break up and change alliances, it’s very difficult.” Kidnapping has become systemic. A 2011 report from Mexico’s National Commission of Human Rights cited 10,000 abductions in six months, leading many advocates to estimate that 20,000 people a year are abducted in Mexico on their way to the United States. In some cases, women are used as currency to pay for passage through areas controlled by drug cartels. The cartels generally require each coyote to sell at least one woman into prostitution every two months in lieu of his monthly fee, according to Óscar Martínez, a Salvadoran journalist who investigated smuggling rings for his book “The Beast.” And in the United States, the exploitation continues. Smugglers sometimes buy migrants for $100 or $200 each, then extort relatives to make the money back. “They rent a house, gut it, throw down a few mattresses, and then when aliens get there, take their shoes, clothes and put them in a room,” said Sean McElroy, assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Houston. “And usually, you will walk into a bedroom and see 20 people sitting on hands and knees, sometimes tied up with zip ties and with burlap sacks over their heads.”
world/americas,In June, Homeland Security began Operation Coyote, leading to 540 smuggling-related arrests and the seizure of more than $950,000 in suspected smuggling payments from 504 bank accounts, as well as 56 vehicles. Experts welcomed the effort, but said that it had touched only a tiny piece of the trafficking industry. In most cases, especially in Central America and Mexico, smugglers still operate with impunity. Few migrants or their families ever call the police. In Cecilia’s case, her mother, frantic after not hearing from her daughter for weeks, took cash from a lender, hoping to make it to the United States to find her daughter and repay the original loan. But she lost everything at the Mexican border when a coyote robbed her and refused to bring her north because she was pregnant. Jacinto was now considered responsible for the debts, but he said he had no way to pay. Cecilia said her captor became more aggressive, prompting her to play her final card: a telephone number in her pocket. Before she had left, her father had given her the home number of a Miami human rights activist whose lawn he had occasionally cut as a teenager in the United States. He had not seen the family — the Maríns — in years. “I get this call, and it’s a girl saying, ‘It’s Cecilia. Can you help me? They won’t let me out unless we pay money,’ ” said Ms. Marín, who did not want her full name published because of security concerns. “I said, ‘Who is Cecilia?’ ”
world/americas,The coyote got on the phone and made the terms clear: He wanted $500 immediately, and someone had to come to Houston to retrieve the girl. Flabbergasted, Ms. Marín explained to the coyote that she did not know her. A series of calls later, Ms. Marín realized that Cecilia was her former employee’s daughter. She eventually agreed to pay the $500, and the man agreed to drive east. But every time he crossed another state line, he called and demanded more, raising the price for Cecilia’s release to $1,700 by the time he reached northern Florida. “It was clear that if we did not comply, she would wind up in a brothel,” said Ana Reyes, Ms. Marín’s family friend who fielded most of the phone calls. The more Ms. Marín thought about the proposition, the angrier she became. “It’s vile blackmail,” she said. But she agreed to meet in Naples, about two hours’ drive from Miami. Ms. Reyes, her toddler, Ms. Marín and Ms. Marín’s sister and niece all piled into a car to rendezvous with the smuggler. On the ride to Naples, the women rehearsed what they would tell the police if they were arrested. “I had no choice,” Ms. Marín thought. “They would prostitute her. What was I supposed to do? Leave her?” Along the way, they exchanged several phone calls with the man, who needed directions. He could not spell the names of the street signs and kept calling an unknown conspirator seeking authorization for price changes.
world/americas,The trip ended off Interstate 75, near a Circle K convenience store, where Ms. Marín and her entourage encountered a red Jeep Cherokee with temporary license plates. There were two men in the car. The driver was middle-aged and wore glasses. He lifted his shirt to show the firearm tucked in his waistband. He wanted $1,500, but Ms. Marín had brought only $900. Her sister scraped together another $100 from her purse. “When he showed the gun, I was so mad,” Ms. Marín said. “I said, ‘Look, sir, I don’t know her. I did not hire you. Take her!’ When he saw my rage, he said, ‘You don’t know her?’ ” “ ‘No, I don’t,’ ” she answered. “ ‘I am going to lose money on this, but O.K.,’ ” he said. He took the $1,000 and let Cecilia out of the car. She carried nothing. Her bag, her clothes were gone. All she had was lipstick, in her front pocket. Over the next few weeks, Cecilia’s father would be threatened by the lender; her mother would give birth, adding another child to the crowded house that might soon be seized; and Cecilia would learn that her dreams of sending home $1,000 a month were unrealistic. But by the smuggler’s accounting, there on the side of the road, Cecilia had been well served. “You have to be thankful,” he said. “We treated her well.”
business/international,The Fully Self-Driving Car Is Still Years Away - The New York Times Even as automakers and technology companies have been promoting a euphoric vision of the future in which cars will drive themselves and serious crashes will be rare, their engineers have been engaged in a sobering debate. Just how autonomous can and should cars become? the engineers are asking. Is there an inherent danger in technology that invites human drivers to sit back and relax — but still requires them to be ready to hit the brakes or grab the wheel at the first sign of trouble? Those questions have taken on a new urgency after the revelation this week that the driver of a Tesla Model S died in a crash in Florida while the electric car was operating in its Autopilot mode. The man, Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was driving on a divided highway, when a tractor-trailer truck made a left turn and crossed in front of Mr. Brown’s lane of traffic. Tesla said neither Mr. Brown nor the car’s self-driving system noticed the white truck against a bright sky, and the brakes were never applied. For now, other automakers are giving no sign of slowing down their efforts to push forward with cars that can drive themselves. But mainly they say the technology isn’t ready yet — which for many is an implicit rebuke of Tesla’s willingness to tempt tech-minded drivers to turn tomorrow’s vision into today’s road reality.
business/international,On Friday, even as the world was absorbing news of Mr. Brown’s death as the first known fatality of the autonomous driving revolution, the German automaker BMW said it intended to offer a “self-driving car” — but not until 2021. And it will have much different technology than is now available on the Tesla Model S. “Today we are standing at the brink of a new revolution,” Harald Krüger, BMW chief executive, said at a news conference in Munich. Mr. Krüger added that the Tesla crash was “really very sad” and said BMW would need “the next few years” to perfect its autonomous driving system. “Today the technologies are not ready for serious production,” he said. The world’s largest carmaker, Toyota, is a notable holdout in the rush toward completely autonomous cars. Last year, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in a Silicon Valley-based research effort to focus on cars that will function as “guardian angels,” saving human drivers from errors, rather than replacing them. Tesla, which started its Autopilot feature last fall, has emphasized in discussing Mr. Brown’s death that the system isn’t intended to take over complete control of the car and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert and engaged. The point highlights the difference in approach that separates companies working on self-driving technology.
business/international,Ford Motor, Google, Volvo and others are aiming at offering fully autonomous cars that can operate safely without human intervention at all — an approach engineers call Level 4 automated driving. Those companies are wary of semiautonomous, or Level 3, technology that can drive the car for stretches of road under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to be ready to take over. Tesla’s Autopilot is not even a fully fledged Level 3 technology, and some experts say it is a risky approach. “There’s a huge inherent danger and it’s well proven — the computer making a mistake and the driver not taking over quickly enough,” said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. The trouble is that while semiautonomous systems like Tesla’s are guiding a car, human drivers can be lulled into feeling they are able to turn their attention away from the road. Mr. Brown, like some other Model S owners, posted videos showing the driver with no hands on the steering wheel. In one video, a driver climbs into the back seat. Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending machine company from Connellsville, Pa., owns a 2013 Model S that does not have Autopilot. But he drove a loaner with the feature earlier this year while his was being repaired. He loves his car and has deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when that car is available, yet he is “on the fence” about getting Autopilot.
business/international,While the technology “was the greatest thing” on closed highways like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it could become confused in more complicated environments like construction zones, Mr. Cordaro said. “My experience is it’s really not completely safe except in limited-access highways,” he said. “It gives you a false sense of security. You get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel but you really can’t. It should be called Auto-assist, instead of Autopilot, because that’s all it is.” Even Amnon Shashua, an executive whose technology is part of Tesla’s self-driving feature, said on Friday that he did not think self-driving’s time had yet come. Mr. Shashua is co-founder and chairman of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes camera and sensing technology. According to the Tesla website, Tesla uses Mobileye components but developed the self-driving system in the Model S itself. Mobileye, along with the chip maker Intel, is at work in a partnership with BMW on the self-driving car that the German automaker described in Munich on Friday that is supposed to be available in 2021. Mr. Shashua suggested that self-driving technology was close, but still not quite ready for actual use without human drivers remaining engaged. “Five years is a very short time,” Mr. Shashua said. “On the other hand, it is a sufficient time to do the types of validations that are needed.” The BMW car Mobileye is collaborating on will be capable of piloting itself on highways, but not necessarily in complex urban settings.
business/international,Automakers and technology companies still need to do “hundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers of validation and simulations” in closed testing environments to be certain the technology is safe, Mr. Shashua said. “I think it is very important, especially given this accident and what we hear in the news, that companies are very transparent about the limitations of the system,” he said. Although Tesla has publicly said that it has enhanced the Mobileye technology, the company has not commented on whether it has enhanced the system to protect against what the industry describes as “lateral turn across path”— the type of situation in the Florida accident. Others in the automotive industry are working on sensor technologies meant to detect vehicles from all angles. One approach is lidar — a system that uses rotating laser beams. Lidar is being used in the experimental autonomous vehicle being developed by BMW, as well as those by Google, Nissan and Apple. But it remains unclear whether the laser system will come down enough in price to use in mass-market cars.
sports/golf,With Back Problems, Tiger Woods Withdraws After 11 Holes - The New York Times SAN DIEGO —  Tiger Woods’s latest comeback suffered another setback Thursday when he quit after 11 holes of his opening round at the Farmers Insurance Open, citing a stiff back. Six days after saying that his surgically repaired back was fine and that it was “not an issue anymore,” Woods hit his tee shot on his 12th hole — a par 3 — onto the green but did not hit the putt. In a scene that has become depressingly familiar, he shook his playing competitors’ hands before being whisked off to the parking lot in a cart. Woods, 39, was two over par at the time. After making bogeys on two of his first three holes, he had battled back to even par after 10 holes. The last score he recorded was a double bogey set up by a bad tee shot and three poor chips. Nicholas Thompson posted an eight-under 64 on the North Course to take the early lead before play was suspended because of darkness. It was the third time Woods has withdrawn in his past eight competitive starts dating to last March. In that span he has also missed three cuts. In his first 296 starts as a pro, Woods failed to finish a round three times and withdrew before a round twice (in 1996 because of a back injury and in 2006 because of influenza).
sports/golf,Woods, who was grouped with Billy Horschel and Rickie Fowler, was in the third threesome off the 10th tee. The start of his round was delayed two and a half hours because of patchy fog. He said his back started to tighten up as he stood on the practice green in the cool, moist air, waiting for updates. Woods described the onset of the tightness as “my glutes shutting off and then they don’t activate and, hence, it goes into my lower back.” Before he walked off the course, Woods bore little resemblance to the player who had won this tournament seven times. He hit loose iron shots and more mediocre chip shots. One of the few highlights was a chip-in on his second hole, leading several fans in his gallery to exult, “Tiger’s back!” Yes, Tiger’s back became the story of the day — just not in that way. The grimaces became more pronounced as he got deeper into his round, and Woods was not the only one wearing a pained look. Many of his fans had a hard time watching him miss the first four greens and hit only one of nine fairways. “He toughed it out a lot more than anyone else,” Horschel said, adding: “He’s a fighter. He wants to get the reps in. He wants to play well, and he kept trying to play through it, hoping that it would loosen up.”
sports/golf,Woods’s last recorded round, an 82 on the second day of the Phoenix Open, was his worst as a pro. Afterward, Paul Azinger, a former major champion, observed on Golf Channel that Woods did not have the same game or deportment that he displayed in his prime. As his touch around the greens has grown frigid, his personality has warmed up considerably. During one delay between holes on Thursday, Woods sat and talked amiably with Fowler. “Tiger used to be uncomfortable if you were comfortable with him,” Azinger said on the Golf Channel broadcast. “Now he’s uncomfortable if you aren’t comfortable with him.” For the last 45 minutes of the delay, Woods stood on the green conversing easily with Horschel and any other player who wandered by. He did not disappear into the conditioning trailer to stretch or return to the warmth of the locker room. The fog was tougher to read than the Torrey Pines greens, making it hard to guess how long the suspension would last. No sooner had the mist rolled out, prompting players to take their places on the tees, than it returned. “I was ready to go,” Woods said. “I had a good warm-up session the first time around. Then we stood out here and I got cold, and everything started deactivating again.”
sports/golf,After Woods finished talking, he folded his body into a sporty tournament courtesy car. His next scheduled start is in three weeks, at the Honda Classic a short drive from his home in Florida. He said last week that his goal was to get in as many competitive rounds as he could before teeing off in the Masters in April. After his 82 last week and his withdrawal on Thursday, that goal seemed unattainable. “It’s very unfortunate; I think he’s doing a lot of good things in his game,” Horschel said. He added: “I don’t think he’s that far off. If he can just stay healthy and be able to work on it, I think that we would see the results. And it’s unfortunate, like I said. It was tough to see him go, but he was in quite a bit of pain out there.”
health,Maurice Hilleman, M.M.R. Vaccine’s Forgotten Hero - The New York Times We live in an epidemiological bubble and are for the most part blissfully unaware of it. Diseases that were routine hazards of childhood for many Americans living today now seem like ancient history. And while every mother could once identify measles in a heartbeat, now even the best hospitals have to call in their eldest staff members to ask: “Is this what we think it is?” To a remarkable extent, we owe our well-being, and in many cases our lives, to the work of one man and to events that happened 50 years ago this spring. At 1 a.m. on March 21, 1963, an intense, irascible but modest Merck scientist named Maurice R. Hilleman was asleep at his home in the Philadelphia suburb of Lafayette Hill when his 5-year-old daughter, Jeryl Lynn, woke him with a sore throat. Dr. Hilleman felt the side of her face and then the telltale swelling beneath the jaw indicating mumps. He tucked her back into bed, about the only treatment anyone could offer at the time. For most children, mumps was a nuisance disease, nothing worse than a painful swelling of the salivary glands. But Dr. Hilleman knew that it could sometimes leave a child deaf or otherwise permanently impaired. He quickly dressed and drove 20 minutes to pick up proper sampling equipment from his laboratory. Returning home, he woke Jeryl Lynn long enough to swab the back of her throat and immerse the specimen in a nutrient broth. Then he drove back to store it in the laboratory freezer.
health,The name Maurice Hilleman may not ring a bell. But today 95 percent of American children receive the M.M.R. — the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella that Dr. Hilleman invented, starting with the mumps strain he collected that night from his daughter. It was by no means his only contribution. At Dr. Hilleman’s death in 2005, other researchers credited him with having saved more lives than any other scientist in the 20th century. Over his career, he devised or substantially improved more than 25 vaccines, including 9 of the 14 now routinely recommended for children. “One person did that!” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a longtime friend of Dr. Hilleman’s and now director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Truly amazing.” As a young man in Montana, Maurice Hilleman had intended only to become a manager at the J. C. Penney store. He turned out not to have the perfect retail personality. (Asked later in life what he was proudest of in his career, he replied, “Being able to survive while being a bastard.”) After getting a Ph.D. in microbiology at the University of Chicago, he went on to spend most of his career at Merck, but the corporate personality also eluded him. He had a sailor’s vocabulary, and his brand of peer review often included shipboard expletives (though he used them “in a constructive way,” Dr. Fauci said with a smile).
health,But everyone recognized Dr. Hilleman’s genius at discovering and perfecting vaccines, which he pursued, Dr. Fauci said, with a rare combination of “exquisite scientific knowledge” and an “amazingly practical get-it-done personality.” Vaccines are tools for coaxing the immune system to resist a disease without producing the actual symptoms, and making them was as much an art as a science. “It’s not like there was a formula for this,” said Dr. Paul A. Offit, a Philadelphia pediatrician, vaccine developer and the author of “Vaccinated,” a 2007 biography of Dr. Hilleman. The general practice was to isolate a disease organism, figure out how to keep it alive in the laboratory, then weaken or “attenuate” it by passing it over and over through a series of cells, typically from chicken embryos, until it could no longer reproduce in humans but could still elicit an immune response. Other steps followed, particularly for Dr. Hilleman, who was obsessed with safety and with stripping away unwanted side effects. That spring of 1963, the Food and Drug Administration also granted the first license for a vaccine against measles. Much of the early work on the virus had been done in the laboratory of John F. Enders at Boston Children’s Hospital, but the vaccine still commonly produced rashes and fevers when Dr. Hilleman began to work on it.
health,Under pressure from public health officials to stop a disease then killing more than 500 American children every year, Dr. Hilleman and Dr. Joseph Stokes, a pediatrician, devised a way to minimize the side effects by giving a gamma globulin shot in one arm and the measles vaccine in the other. It was the beginning of the end of the disease in this country. Dr. Hilleman then went on to refine the vaccine over the next four years, eventually producing the much safer Moraten strain that is still in use today. As always, he kept himself in the background: The name stands for “more attenuated enders.” One other crucial event in the development of M.M.R. happened that spring of 1963: An epidemic of rubella began in Europe and quickly swept around the globe. In this country, the virus’s devastating effect on first-trimester pregnancies caused about 11,000 newborns to die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An additional 20,000 suffered birth defects, including deafness, heart disease and cataracts. Dr. Hilleman was already testing his own vaccine as the epidemic ended in 1965. But he agreed to work instead with a vaccine being developed by federal regulators. It was, he later recalled, “toxic, toxic, toxic.” By 1969, he had cleaned it up enough to obtain F.D.A. approval and prevent another rubella epidemic. Finally, in 1971, he put his vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella together to make M.M.R., replacing a series of six shots with just two.
health,Or rather not finally. In 1978, having found a better rubella vaccine than his own, Dr. Hilleman asked its developer if he could use it in the M.M.R. The developer, Dr. Stanley Plotkin, then of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, was momentarily speechless. It was an expensive choice for Merck, and might have been a painful one for anyone other than Dr. Hilleman. “It’s not that he didn’t have an ego. He certainly did,” Dr. Plotkin recalled in a recent interview. “But he valued excellence above that. Once he decided that this strain was better, he did what he had to do,” even if it meant sacrificing his own work. Given Dr. Hilleman’s obsession with safety and effectiveness, it came as a bitter surprise toward the end of his life when his vaccine was at the center of what Dr. Offit called “a perfect storm of fear.” In 1998, The Lancet, a respected British medical journal, published an article alleging that M.M.R. had caused an epidemic of autism. The lead author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, became a media celebrity, and some parents began to balk at having their children immunized; the vaccine’s very success had made them forget just how devastating measles, mumps and rubella could be. Dr. Hilleman, who might reasonably have been expected to win a Nobel Prize, got hate mail and death threats instead. Multiple independent studies would eventually demonstrate that there is no link between M.M.R. and autism, and Dr. Wakefield’s work has been widely discredited. In 2010, the British medical authorities stripped him of the right to practice medicine, and The Lancet retracted the 1998 article.
health,It came too late, not just for Dr. Hilleman, who by then had died of cancer, but also for many parents who mistakenly believed that avoiding the vaccine was the right way to protect their children. In 2011 alone, a measles outbreak in Europe sickened 26,000 people and killed 9. Because the disease is contagious enough to pick up from a traveler walking by in the airport, cases still also occur in this country among the unvaccinated. But Dr. Hilleman would probably still find reason to be encouraged. The Measles and Rubella Initiative, a global campaign organized in 2001, has given the M.M.R. vaccine to a billion children in this century, preventing 9.6 million deaths from measles alone, for less than $2 a dose. According to Dr. Stephen L. Cochi, a global immunization adviser at the C.D.C., the initiative is “on the verge of setting a target date” to eradicate the disease. In this country, the strain that Dr. Hilleman collected from his daughter that night in 1963 has reduced the incidence of mumps to fewer than 1,000 cases a year, from 186,000. Characteristically, he named it not for himself but for his daughter. Jeryl Lynn Hilleman, now a financial consultant to biotech start-ups in Silicon Valley, turns the credit back on her father. He was driven, she said in an interview, “by a need to be of use — of use to people, of use to humanity.” “All I did,” she added, “was get sick at the right time, with the right virus, with the right father.”
nyregion,Advocates Say City Is Failing in Efforts to Shelter the Homeless With AIDS - The New York Times Correction Appended Dozens of people with AIDS have been turned away from emergency housing despite a November court order that requires the city to provide such shelter, homeless people and their advocates told a City Council hearing yesterday. One homeless man with AIDS, who identified himself only as Greg E., told the Council's General Welfare Committee that he spent five days on the street after being sent to the city's Division of AIDS Services and Income Support by a nursing center on Aug. 15. ''I waited all day and they told me that they didn't have a place,'' he said. ''I told the lady there, 'I have no place to go, where am I going to sleep?' She told me that's 'all we can do; we don't have a place,' so I slept by the steps on 161st Street.'' But the city's lawyers and the Human Resources Administration, which is responsible for providing such housing, say that all homeless people with AIDS are being served appropriately. Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement that the agency's AIDS housing division ''continues to provide emergency housing placement to all eligible homeless clients on the same day of the request.'' She did not return several calls seeking additional comment.
nyregion,In a letter sent to the Council committee, Mark Hoover, the administration's first deputy commissioner, said 85 percent of the AIDS housing division's 27,142 clients needed help with housing, including rental assistance. Last year, the division received 14,141 requests for emergency housing and made 13,607 referrals. Of those, more than a third failed to show at the locations given them, he said. But Councilwoman Christine Quinn said that despite assertions that it had been providing the required shelter, in recent weeks the city had failed in its efforts. She told the council that last Friday, 11 AIDS clients were assigned to a hotel, only to find they were given the wrong address and had to spend Labor Day weekend on the street. She added that this Tuesday at 9:20 p.m., the Division of AIDS Services assigned 10 clients to the Best Western Seaport Inn in Lower Manhattan, but that three of the clients were forced to sleep outside when the hotel said that it had not received their names. In a later interview, Councilwoman Quinn said: ''What we're saying is, over the past two to three weeks, something has changed. The crisis has occurred. I also think it is illustrative of the overall problem in H.R.A.,'' she said, that the only potential problem that the agency points out ''is one that would be caused by the clients.''
nyregion,In a strongly worded decision last November, the courts ruled that the city must provide housing for people with AIDS the same day they request it, instead of within 24 hours, the time frame under which the city had been operating. In her ruling, Justice Emily Jane Goodman of State Supreme Court said that ''a night on the streets for persons living with our modern plague of AIDS is medically inappropriate.'' She said that a 1997  city law calling for ''medically appropriate housing'' required the Division of AIDS Services to provide immediate shelter. Mr. Hoover's letter to the Council yesterday, however, reverted to the city's former position in its wording, saying that ''all eligible clients seeking emergency housing assistance have been served within 24 hours in compliance with the law.'' He was not available for comment. Last week, the city announced that it would appeal Justice Goodman's November ruling. Leonard Koerner, chief of appeals for the city's legal department, said that the city had asked for an additional month, beyond the nine months it was given, to complete its appeal. He said the small number of homeless people with AIDS who were not given a more permanent place to stay were given hotel rooms. ''We will send someone out to a hotel room, not to a park bench, because we believe philosophically that someone should be placed,'' he said.
nyregion,As of 6:15 p.m. yesterday, Karen Pena, a caseworker who represents a client of the Division of AIDS Services, said it looked as though 7 out of 11 people waiting for emergency housing at one of the human resources agency's Manhattan offices would be served, while 4 most likely would not. Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of the General Welfare Committee, has planned another City Council hearing for Sept. 28. ''We're going to try to get to the bottom of this,'' he said. ''Our obligation to offer assistance to people who are clearly qualified for that is something we need to take seriously.'' Correction: September 14, 2000, Thursday  An article on Friday about a hearing of the New York City Council's General Welfare Committee, at which homeless people with AIDS testified that they had been turned away from emergency shelters, misstated the date of a second hearing scheduled on the complaints. It is Sept. 29, not Sept. 28.
world/europe,U.S. Officials Say They Suspect SA-11 or SA-20 Missiles Brought Down Malaysia Jet - The New York Times American officials, who said a surface-to-air missile was responsible for shooting down a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on Thursday, said they suspected that the missile was either an SA-11 or SA-20, both Russian made. In the early hours of the investigation, determining clear accountability for a missile attack was impossible, in part because all three of the forces in or near the conflict area — the pro-Russian separatists, the Ukrainian military and the Russian military — could possess SA-11s, which are one of many legacy weapons from the Soviet Union circulating through this war. Known in Russian as a “Buk” and among NATO nations as a “Gadfly,” the SA-11 was first designed in the 1970s. Successor variants are in the inventories of both Russian and Ukrainian air-defense units. A Buk system is vehicle-mounted and self-propelled, which means it can be moved around the battlefield, making it hard to track. For ordnance, the SA-11 system fires roughly 18-foot-long missiles that can reach much higher than the reported altitude — 33,000 feet — of the Malaysian passenger jet. (Some variants of the missiles can reach above 70,000 feet.) Each missile carries a large high-explosive warhead, against which a thin-skinned Boeing 777 would have no defense. SA-11s are normally operated in a battery, with a command vehicle and a separate target-acquisition radar. According to a written analysis by Doug Richardson of IHS Jane’s, a sole SA-11 vehicle “can also operate in stand-alone mode.”
world/europe,“Its built-in radar is normally used to track the target being engaged, but can be operated in a target-detection mode, allowing it to autonomously engage targets that were present in the radar’s forward field of view,” he wrote. This would mean the separatists might be capable of using an SA-11, too, even without a full battery. (Recent interviews with rebels by The New York Times found that many were veterans of the Soviet or Ukrainian militaries, including air-defense units.) But whether the rebels possess SA-11s, as part of a battery or otherwise, is an unsettled question. Ukrainian and American officials have accused Russia of providing the separatists with many sophisticated and powerful weapons, and the rebels have also captured many Ukrainian weapons, meaning they could have obtained SA-11s from either source. A social media post attributed to Igor Strelkov, the shadowy pro-Russian commander, showed him claiming to have captured Buk missiles. That claim has not been verified independently, and the rebels have been given to boasts. The Ukrainian government released audio recordings that it claimed were intercepted phone calls between rebels discussing shooting down the plane. The separatists have repeatedly spoken of other, verifiable air-defense capabilities, and have often been seen with other surface-to-air missiles — heat-seeking, shoulder-fired missiles known as Manpads. With maximum elevations that are not much beyond 10,000 feet, Manpads cannot reach to the cruising altitudes of commercial passenger jets. Both pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian officials have said, however, that they have shot down helicopters in the conflict.
world/europe,In Turkey, U.S. Hand Is Seen in Nearly Every Crisis - The New York Times
sports/golf,Ignore TV Ratings: Golf Is Healthier Than It Appears - The New York Times ATLANTA — Jim Sanford was hitting microchipped golf balls off a mat between swigs of beer and bites of sushi. He was wearing flip flops. It was a recent 100-degree Sunday night in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Sanford and his date, Karen Boldt, were playing Topgolf, a cross between Skee-Ball and archery, with the ambience of an outdoor bowling alley, in which participants take aim at 11 color-coded targets, accruing points for accuracy and distance. A couple of hitting bays to Sanford’s right, a barefoot man was taking cuts with a driver. Nearby, a woman in a clingy dress and black stiletto heels took her swings. She had never used a club before and was part of an eight-person birthday party. Six days later and roughly 2,000 miles away, another party was heating up at the BMW Championship, the third PGA Tour playoff event, which was held in a Chicago suburb. It was midday last Saturday, and the line of BMW owners, dressed mostly in garden party attire, was 50-deep to get out of the humidity and into the air-conditioning in a corporate box overlooking the 17th tee box at Conway Farms. The crowd was overwhelmingly white and consisted of 49 adults and one minor clutching his mother’s hand. The PGA Tour, with its country club core, used to reflect the sport’s demographic target. But that appears to be changing. The game is becoming more and more diverse. Along with its graying group of well-heeled enthusiasts, there are the Topgolf participants looking for a low-key evening out and a rainbow coalition of young beginners.
sports/golf,According to Golf Digest, a 2016 study of golf participation by the National Golf Foundation, found that the number of beginning golfers had grown to 2.5 million, a record. Nearly a third of the 2.9 million junior golfers last year were girls, nearly twice the number 20 years ago. And more than a quarter of all junior golfers are non-Caucasian, a fourfold increase from 1995. As the Tour Championship gets underway Thursday without three headlining players, what better time to recognize that rumors of the sport’s demise are premature? The game appears healthier than the 14-time major champion Tiger Woods, who was limited to one official tour start this season because of a chronic back injury, his misery compounded by a mismanagement of medications. It is healthier than Rory McIlroy, the defending FedEx Cup champion, who never rebounded from an early-season rib injury and who failed to advance to the Tour Championship’s 30-man field at East Lake Golf Club. It is hale enough to survive the absence this week of Phil Mickelson, the perennial fan favorite whose closing surge could not make up for his midseason dip in form. A new generation, led by the P.G.A. Championship winner Justin Thomas, who collected five titles this season, and the United States Open champion Brooks Koepka, ably filled the power vacuum. Yes, they were playing to a smaller audience. The final round of the P.G.A. Championship last month had its second-lowest ratings in the past 20 years, surpassing only 2008, when the tournament aired opposite the Beijing Olympics. The 3.6 overnight number — which came two months after the U.S. Open recorded the second-lowest overnight Nielsen ratings for its final round — launched dozens of misguided tweets about the ailing state of the game.
sports/golf,“TV ratings are really not a measure of whether golf is popular,” said Geoff Ogilvy, the 2006 U.S. Open champion. His view is widely held by the pros, who see ratings as a flawed indicator of golf’s reach. Television is the pretty packaging. The substance of golf is the indelible — and wholly organic — image from the end of the P.G.A. Championship, when Jordan Spieth and a handful of other players stuck around long after they were finished so they could be among the first people to congratulate Thomas. The show of sportsmanship highlighted golf’s capacity for competition and friendship. It made golf look cool and fun, the Tour veteran Charley Hoffman said, adding, “I think it can’t do anything but help the game.” One of the players waiting for Thomas behind Quail Hollow’s 18th green was Rickie Fowler, whose 1.57 million Twitter followers attest to his success in attracting attention to the game. At this year’s U.S. Open, Fowler was criticized in a Golf Digest column after he opted not to sit in the interview room for a formal news conference when he held the first-round lead. The column implied that, because the interview room is more conducive to probing questions and thoughtful responses, Fowler had squandered a chance to grow the game by choosing to stand and answer questions in an informal setting outside.
sports/golf,Anecdotal evidence abounds that Fowler lavishes attention on the people who really matter: the children who represent the game’s future. In 2012, he headlined a corporate event at Long Island’s Huntington Crescent Golf Club. He was scheduled to conduct a 15-minute clinic and answer a few questions. He stayed for nearly an hour and a half and spent at least five minutes with each child there, according to John Schob, the head golf professional at the club. Fowler stuck their tees into the ground for them and offered swing tips. The encounter inspired a few of the children to pursue golf, Schob said. How better to grow the game than to hook participants when they are young? The concept is not cutting edge. It took root centuries ago in Scotland, where there is a nine-hole, par-3 course in North Berwick that is primarily for children (and that spawned Catriona Matthew, winner of the 2009 Women’s British Open). “There’s a sign there that says adults can only play when accompanied by a child,” Ogilvy said. “In one sign, you fix golf.” Conway Farms was subdivided into corporate suites, which seemed like a sign that the PGA Tour’s approach continues to be growing the wealth to grow the game — golf as an “aspirational” pursuit. “You grow the game from the ground up, not from TV down,” said Brian Harman, who wasn’t sure the corporate suites were worthwhile. “The people in there are not watching golf,” he added. “They’re not young kids out here getting access and watching golf.”
sports/golf,The tour players Scott Brown and Kevin Kisner are committed to growing the game at the grass-roots level in Aiken, S.C., where they live. The University of South Carolina Aiken, which Brown attended, has set aside 60 acres for development of a golf practice facility, replete with nine holes, short-game areas, meeting rooms, locker rooms and classrooms. The facility will house the men’s team and perhaps pave the way for the addition of a women’s team. It will also be a new home to a local First Tee program, a junior golf enterprise focused on bringing the game to economically disadvantaged areas. The program currently operates out of a nearby private club, to which it pays rent. At the new location, the members will have access to student tutors and mentors from the college. For some children, it might be their first exposure to a college campus, and the experience could be the seed that produces the fruit of higher education. “It will change their whole outlook growing up,” Kisner said. Kisner and Brown are helping raise funds for the project, which will cost roughly $3 million. Obtaining the seed money has proved a challenge, but the players are determined to see the project through. “For us, it’s like, how has this never been done before?” Brown said. Topgolf, a booming entertainment franchise with roughly three dozen locations around the country and several more to open soon, is an entryway to golf for adults. It offers a more relaxed approach and easy access to the game.
sports/golf,Do the barefoot man and the woman in stilettos count as golfers? Paul Casey believes so. “They are still golf fans, they are still absorbing, or taking in — consuming — the game,” he said, adding, “I don’t think the game has any issues whatsoever. I just think it’s changing and it’s organic. I think it’s cool.”
us/politics,Justice Department Briefing on Blagojevich Investigation - The New York Times The following is a transcript of a news briefing about the investigation into Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois, as provided by CQ Transcriptions. Speakers:Patrick Fitzgerald, United States attorney general for the Northern District of IllinoisRobert Grant, Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge MR. FITZGERALD: Good morning. Joining me is, to my far right, is Rob Grant, the special agent in charge for the FBI office here in Chicago. To his left is Al Patton , the special agent in charge of the IRS Criminal Investigative Division. And to his left is Tom Brady, the inspector in charge for the Postal Inspection Service in Chicago. Behind me, to my left, are Cary Hamilton (ph), Reed Sharp (ph) and Chris Neewanner (ph), assistant U.S. attorneys. This is a sad day for government. It's a very sad day for Illinois government. Governor Blagojevich has taken us to a truly new low. Governor Blagojevich has been arrested in the middle of what we can only describe as a political corruption crime spree. We acted to stop that crime spree. The most appalling conduct Governor Blagojevich engaged in, according to the complaint filed today or unsealed today, is that he attempted to sell a Senate seat, the Senate seat he had the sole right to under Illinois to appoint to replace President-elect Obama. Let me take you back eight weeks ago to set the allegations in context.
us/politics,Back eight weeks ago we the following environment. There was a known investigation of the Blagojevich administration that had been going on for years involving allegations of pay-to-play conduct and corruption. There had been a recent trial of an associate of Governor Blagojevich in which allegations were aired, where people testified that Governor Blagojevich was involved in corrupt conduct, and there was an Ethics in Government Act that was pending, that would go into effect January 1 of 2009, that would bar certain contributions from people doing business with the state of Illinois. You might have thought in that environment that pay-to-play would slow down. The opposite happened. It sped up. Government (sic) Blagojevich and others were working feverishly to get as much money from contractors, shaking then down, pay-to-play, before the end of the year. I will give you one example. A month or so ago a $1.8 billion tollway project was announced. While that tollway project was being announced, Governor Blagojevich was privately seeking to have a person benefiting from that contract raise $100,000 in contributions, and privately the government (sic) said, "I could have made a larger announcement but wanted to see how they would perform by the end of the year. If they don't perform, bleep 'em." That's a quote. And the word "bleep" was not the word he used. After being aware that actually the pay-to-play scheme had taken -- taken up greater steam and greater urgency back eight weeks ago, after careful review, the decision was made that more extraordinary means of investigation needed to be used.
us/politics,After that point, a bug was placed in the campaign offices of Governor Blagojevich and a tap was placed on his home telephone. And that tap and that bug bore out what those allegations were. I'll give you two examples set forth in the 76-page complaint. One involves Children's Memorial Hospital, a hospital that obviously takes care of children. At one point, the governor awarded funding, reimbursement funding to that hospital to the tune of $8 million. But he also indicated privately that what he wanted to get was a $50,000 personal contribution from the chief executive officer of that hospital. In the ensuing weeks, that contribution never came. And Governor Blagojevich was intercepted on the telephone checking to see whether or not he could pull back the funding for Children's Memorial Hospital. A second example is legislation that is pending concerning horseracing. There is a bill that I believe sits on the governor's desk that would take money from casino revenues and divert a percentage of it to horseracing tracks. While this was pending, the interceptions show that the governor was told that one person who he was seeking to have raise $100,000 also was working with a person who was seeking that money to have a bill pending. And the governor was told that the person who wanted that bill -- from whom they wanted money -- was told the following: that he needed to get his contribution. And the quote was, "Look, there is a concern that there is going to be some skittishness if your bill gets signed because of the timeliness of the commitment," closed quote. Then the person told the contributor, the money, quote, "got to be in now," closed quote.
us/politics,And when the governor was told this part of the conversation, his response was, "Good." Shortly thereafter, the person who was trying to get the contribution from the person who had the bill pending suggested that the governor call the person directly, that it would be better to get the call personally from the governor, quote, "from a pressure point of view," closed quote, and the governor agreed. As we sit here now, as far as we know, that bill sits on the governor's desk. That $8 million in funding is still pending. In addition to the pay-to-play allegations, which are described in greater detail in the complaint, we also were surprised to learn of an extortionate attempt against the Chicago Tribune newspaper. The Chicago Tribune had not been kind to Governor Blagojevich, had written editorials that called for his impeachment. And Governor Blagojevich and defendant Jonathan -- John Harris, his chief of staff, schemed to send a message to the Chicago Tribune that if the Tribune Company wanted to sell its ballfield, Wrigley Field, in order to complete a business venture, the price of doing so was to fire certain editors, including one editor by name. In the governor words -- governor's words, quote, "Fire all those bleeping people. Get them the bleep out of there. And get us some editorial support," close quote. And the bleeps are not really bleeps.
us/politics,The defendant Harris tried to frame the message more subtly to get the point across to the Tribune that firing the editorial board members would be a good thing in terms of getting financing to allow the sale to go forward. But the most cynical behavior in all this, the most appalling, is the fact that Governor Blagojevich tried to sell the appointment to the Senate seat vacated by President-elect Obama. The conduct would make Lincoln roll over in his grave. The governor's own words describing the Senate seat, quote, "It's a bleeping valuable thing -- thing. You just don't give it away for nothing," close quote. Another quote, "I've got this thing, and it's bleeping golden. And I'm just not giving it up for bleeping nothing. I'm not going to do it, and I can always use it; I can parachute me there," quote. Those are his words, not our characterization, other than with regard to the bleep. The tapes reveal that Governor Blagojevich wanted a number of things in exchange for making the appointment to the Senate seat -- an appointment as secretary of health and human services or an ambassadorship, an appointment to a private foundation, a higher paying job for his wife or campaign contributions. At one point, he proposed a three-way deal -- that a cushy union job would be given to him at a higher rate of pay where he could make money.
us/politics,In exchange, he thought that the union might get benefits from the president-elect, and therefore, the president-elect might get the candidate his choice. I should make clear the complaint makes no allegations about the president-elect whatsoever -- his conduct. This part of the scheme lost steam when the person that the governor thought was the president-elect's choice of senator took herself out of the running. But after the deal never happened, this is the governor's reaction. Quote, "They're not willing to give me anything but appreciation. Bleep them," close quote. And again, the bleed is a redaction. What I should also talk about is that in another event, somebody else approached the governor. And the governor's understanding of this approach was that in exchange for an appointment to the Senate seat, he would receive campaign contributions. And the government's view of what was told to him through intermediaries was that, quote, "We were approached pay to play, that you know, he raised me 500 grand, then the other guy would raise a million if I made him senator," close quote. This was a conversation with a senator describing how he perceived the message that came through multiple hands. His concern was he offense -- that he though campaign contributions were being offered in exchange for a senate seat? No. He was worried that the campaign contributions would actually be paid. He wasn't the corrupt deal; he was against being stiffed in the corrupt deal.
us/politics,His quote was he wanted the money, quote, "tangible, upfront," close quote. He told someone who was his intermediary, quote, "Some of the stuff's got to start happening now; right now, we got to see it," close quote. Just last week, he was saying this to someone to make sure that the money was going to be up front. And he said, quote, "You got to be careful how you express that, and assume everybody's listening. The whole world is listening. I would do it in person. I would not do it on the phone," close quote. That's the governor of Illinois. After an article appeared in the Tribune last week, indicating a belief that Mr. Blagojevich had been taped, then a message was sent for him to undo contact with the intermediary on that campaign contribution deal. And, finally, we should also note that the governor talked about appointing himself to the Senate seat for reasons not having to do with the better welfare of the citizens of Illinois. He wanted to do it to avoid impeachment in the Illinois legislature for his conduct. He wanted to do it to have access to greater financial resources, if he were indicted. He wanted to do it to see if he could help his wife work as a lobbyist. He wanted to do it to remake his image to run for office in 2016, and he wanted to do it to see if he could generate speaking fees.
us/politics,At the end of the day, the conduct we have before us is appalling. What I do want to note is that, at the end of the day, it's very, very important that how we proceed from here be the right way to proceed. We have a lot of information gained from a number of interviews and investigation over the years. We have a tremendous amount of information gained from the wiretap and the bugs that occurred over the last month and a half or so. What we also know is that some of these schemes went pretty far and some did not go far at all. But they had discussions about what they would do, who they would approach and how they would phrase it. And we need to do the investigation, now that the investigation is overt, to find out from other people what happened, what they were told, how explicitly, what they understood, and what happened. That part of the investigation we intend to conduct responsibly. We hope people out there understand that this complaint only charges two individuals. These two individuals are presumed innocent. But we make no charges about any of the other people who are referenced in the complaint, most not by name. And people should not cast aspersions on people who were discussed on wiretap or bug tapes, or conduct with other people, or scheming to figure out how to approach them for different things.
us/politics,We hope you'll bear that in mind and not cast aspersions on people for being named or being discussed, or if you learn they're being interviewed. The other part is that I think this is a moment of truth for Illinois. In all seriousness, we have times when people decry corruption, and yet here we have a situation where there to appear to be wide-ranging schemes where people are seeking to make people pay contributions to get contracts or appointments or do other stuff. The FBI and their sister agencies at Postal, IRS and the Department of Labor have done a magnanimous -- magnificent job. They will continue to work very, very hard. But what we really need is cooperation from people who are not in law enforcement, the people outside who heard or saw things or were approached in ways that felt uncomfortable. If they felt uncomfortable and they think this is not how you run a government, then they outright to come forward and give us that information. Very, very important that we get that information so we can make the right decisions about where to proceed from here. I can tell you, we've been conducting interviews during the day, and we're already quite heartened to hear that there are a number of people out there who were appalled by this conduct who were willing to come forward and talk to us.
us/politics,So I encourage people to talk to us. We encourage people to work with us, to let us get to the bottom of what has happened here. We remind people that there's a lot we don't know and need to know. We remind people that we -- there's an awful lot we do know, and we'll be able to verify what people tell us. But we ask that the press, in particular, recognize that we're not casting aspersions on people other than the two people we charged and bear that in mind and be responsible. And with that, I'd like to turn the microphone over to Rob Grant, a special agent in charge. I want to thank the assistant U.S. attorneys who worked night and day in this case. (inaudible) especially want to thank the FBI agents who monitored the bug and wiretap and did all sorts of work over the last few months on top of the work they've done for years, and their partners at IRS, Postal and Labor. Thanks. MR. GRANT: Thanks, Pat. I know you all have a lot of questions, so I'm not going to -- I'm not going to make this long. Today certainly is a new low for the state of Illinois. A little over two years ago, the U.S. attorney and myself stood up here and talked about the conviction of a former governor and hoped that conviction would send a clear single to elected officials in Illinois that business-as-usual will no longer be tolerated, that selling your office for personal gain is a -- is a practice of the past.
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: It's obvious by this complaint and by today's charges that this current governor did not get that message. I got here four years ago. A lot of you were in the audience, asked me the question of whether or not Illinois is the most corrupt state in the United States. And I didn't answer that question, yes or no, and I can't answer that question today. I don't have 49 other states to compare it with. But I can tell you one thing: If it isn't the most corrupt state in the United States, its certainly one hell of a competitor. This wire tap, I can tell you, from the FBI agents who participated in this wire tap investigation, were thoroughly disgusted and revolted by what they heard. And I think even the most cynical agents in our office were shocked. I want to thank them. They put a lot of countless hours in, as did the prosecutors. A lot of weekends, a lot of holiday times away from their families, and they worked tirelessly to bring this to a successful conclusion. To them goes the credit. Thanks. QUESTION: Mr. Fitzgerald, was this done today in an effort to head off the appointment of someone to fill Barack Obama's Senate seat? Was it -- was it so imminent that that's why you had to step in?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: I would say that we decided that this required unusual measures and there are a lot of things going on that were imminent. There's a bill sitting on a desk that we think a person who was supporting that bill has been squeezed to give $100,000. And to let that bill be signed, to me, would be very, very troubling. There's a hospital -- a children's memorial hospital -- believing that it's getting $8 million, but its CEO has not coughed up a campaign contribution, and the thought that that money may get pulled back from a children's memorial hospital is something that you cannot abide. There is an editor that they'd like fired from the Tribune, and I laid awake at night, worried whether I'd read in the paper in the morning that when there were lay-offs, that we'd find out that that person was laid off. The complaint -- the complaint lays out, in there in fact, when there were layoffs, there were conversations to find out whether the editor who should of -- they thought should be fired, and he wasn't. And the governor was asking whether there would be more layoffs. So we have a governor in this modern times, the only one who's looking for more layoffs. You take that, what's going on and add it to the fact that we have a Senate seat that seemed to be, as recently as days ago, auctioned off to, you know, to the highest bidder for campaign contributions. And Governor Blagojevich, own words, on the -- on the tape or the bug that set forth in the complaint, talked about selling this like a sports agent.
us/politics,QUESTION: Couldn't you... MR. FITZGERALD: So -- so -- I'm just -- and so, we stepped in for a number of reasons. Basically, as I said before, we're in the middle of a clutching crime spree, and we wanted to stop it. OK, OK, OK. Can we -- can we just -- just one second. No, no, no, let me just say one thing. We're going to stay here as long as this is productive. We will -- you're not on a clock. We want to dispel any misperceptions, so don't feel like you got to -- anyone's got to yell to get a question in. OK. QUESTION: (inaudible) you said twice that we shouldn't cast dispersions on people who we think we recognize within a complaint. Does that mean that all of these people are beyond blame in any way? I mean some of the things in the complaint point a very, kind of, a tacky finger at some people, their willingness to play. And the (inaudible) is illegal. Isn't the willingness to play also (inaudible) if you didn't charge today? FITZGERALD: OK, there -- what -- what I'm trying to say is this: Look, we never give -- you know, and I think anyone who's from Chicago knows, you've heard it a thousand times -- we don't give clean bills of health. And what I've always been afraid of is you can say, you know, did -- did Carlos or me -- are we in trouble? I'm never going to say no, because that's just our practice, but I don't want people, when they answer those questions, to imply that someone is in trouble.
us/politics,What I'm trying to do it is explain caution about a complaint. When someone says something that's on tape, largely, they're stuck with it. But when someone says something on tape about someone else, you usually want to do more investigation to verify what it is that happened. And we're going to do that investigation and verify what it is that happened, what didn't happen, what the circumstances are. There may be people who had no idea what was going on, had no idea they were being discussed. There may be other people who were involved in things they shouldn't have been involved in. And we're going to sort that out, and we're going to see, you know, some things will be black and white and some things be shades of gray. And what we wanted to make clear is that our complaint sets forth charges against the governor and Mr. Harris (ph), and we put in their mindset. So what they understand when they're scheming is important to the, you know, probable cause of what they were planning to do when they schemed. We'd like to see what schemes were carried out or not, who made contributions or didn't, that sort of thing. And for that we don't draft complaints with that in mind, and we want people to take what we say with more than a grain of salt, with a whole lot of salt. But we're saying we're going to go out and going to do an investigation. If other people did wrong, we'll deal with that.
us/politics,QUESTION: But, Mr. Fitzgerald (ph), would you please... (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... address one thing, and that is, when Rod Blagojevich walks out of here today, unless I'm mistaken about the constitution of Illinois, he will still be governor. He will still have the power to make the appointment to the Senate seat. He will still have the power whether or not he's going to sign the bill that you're concerned about. Also, would you address the fact -- and I know you referred to this -- would you just address whether or not President-elect Obama was aware that any of these things were taking place? MR. FITZGERALD: OK. I'm not going to speak for what the president- elect was aware of. We make no allegations that he's aware of anything. And that's as simply as I can put it. And the first part, my understanding is that he is the -- he is the sitting governor of Illinois today, now, and that -- that is not something we have any say in or control over. So at the end of the day, he will be the sitting governor. QUESTION: But you say you took this step so that you could intervene because you were afraid something was going to happen with this Senate seat that would taint it. He still has the power to do that.
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: Yes. And when there's -- when there's a bunch of people scheming in private and they think no one's listening and no one's aware of it, they can do a heck of a lot more than when someone goes and basically raids the crime in plot and airs what's going on and people know what we're aware of. And if I were someone who wanted to pay to play, I think this would be about the worst time to try to make a cash contribution to someone to get something illegal. And there's a lot to be said for exposing this to the sunlight. So this is a criminal prosecution that we will see through the court system. He is presumed innocent. But I was not going to wait until March or April or May to get it all nice and tidy, and then bring charges, and then say, "By the way, all this bad stuff happened because no one was aware of it back in December." I think that would be irresponsible. (CROSSTALK) So sometimes when there's ongoing criminal conduct, and this is a very different case than what we often see, we will expose the criminal conduct and bring charges to let people know we're on to it and to hopefully to put a stop to it. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: In your view -- in your view, Pat, should the governor, on his own volition, step aside while he fights these charges, or should the Illinois state legislature move ahead with what it's threatened to do and impeach him? What are your views on both of those?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: The Office of the United States Attorney (ph) has no view. We are not entitled to any view. And the view of what happens in the legislature of Illinois is not for us. QUESTION: Pat, given the scope and the brazenness of this alleged conduct of Governor Blagojevich, what is at stake if that happened despite the cautionary tale that you were providing? MR. FITZGERALD: I just -- I think it tells us certainly -- you know, I don't want to jump ahead of things. Again, the governor is presumed innocent. But the -- if the charges set forth in the complaint are true, it is an appalling, appalling statement about what's been happening in Illinois government with Governor Blagojevich and his chief of staff. And what it tells us is that it's great to have the FBI and their colleagues working on this, but we need people in the public to stand up and say "enough." And if people start hearing things that they feel is untoward or improper, we need them to come forward. We're not going to end corruption in Illinois by arrests and indictments alone. I'm not minimizing the impact of charging people who commit crimes. What's going to make the difference is when people who are approached to pay to play first say no, and, second, report it. QUESTION: Are you able to tell us if the Tribune scenario, it was the Tribune who came to you and said it's being extorted or you approaching the Tribune with this revelation?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: I don't -- that's not set forth in the complaint. What we can tell you is that that was conversations we intercepted on the governor's side, speaking to Mr. Harris about what they wanted to do. QUESTION: So it's conceivable, then, that the Tribune at some level of management was considering -- a force to consider the governor's alleged extortion? MR. GRANT: I'm not going to speak for the Tribune or what happened and what message got there. I think the complaint made clear that Governor Blagojevich, what he had in mind was basically a get rid of the editors for this. The complaint also makes clear that Mr. Harris was one who wanted to be far more nuanced, and, basically, Governor Blagojevich delegated to him, "Well, you know what you got to do. Be careful." So I can't describe to you what conversations Mr. Harris had, and I think it would be dangerous to do so. It goes to my point of -- it's one thing to attribute someone's own words to them. It would be another to attribute someone's own words to you. And, you know, if I say something on tape, then I'm -- I'm charged with what I said. If someone says something on tape about me, that's a different story. So I'm not going to speculate as to what, if any, conversations were had in the -- in the Tribune at this point. I don't think that be fair to them or anyone else, when we're just describing his mindset of what Governor Blagojevich wanted Mr. Harris to do. We're not describing what happened in the scheme beyond that.
us/politics,QUESTION: Mr. Fitzgerald, what does this say about Senator Durbin's letter to the president requesting commutation of George Ryan's (ph) sentence, which is only about a year of a six-and-a-half year sentence, that was imposed for the -- for the crimes (inaudible) this office charged him -- and convicted him? MR. FITZGERALD: That's a different matter. I told you the office doesn't have a view on what -- what happens in, sort of, Illinois government. We just don't have a stake in that. To the extent the office has a view in the Ryan (ph) pardon, if we're asked by the Department of Justice or the White House to express that view, we will do so privately, but we're not going to -- it's inappropriate for me on behalf of the office to express a view where the power of pardon and commutation rests with the president. And it's not our power. And we do not make a practice of commenting to other branches of government what they ought to do unless asked by them in private. QUESTION: Two questions. What does the law say about the (inaudible) of the U.S. Senate, you know, as it relates to the governor before his arrest? And then I have another question, is how could the (inaudible) of the U.S. Senate, you know, change now that, you new, the governor's been arrested?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: And I'm not going to comment on any proposed legislative changes.I think we cite a statute. I can't tell you the numbers off -- offhand. But the bottom line is, it's the sole call -- it's entrusted to the sole discretion of the governor of Illinois. The way the Constitution works, it leaves it for the states to figure out how a senator is replaced if they leave office for any reason. And Illinois has a statute that puts it in the sole hands of the governor. And you can look up that statute, but I'm not going to comment on any proposed modifications. QUESTION: When politicians get together and cut deals -- and, certainly, appointing somebody to the Senate seat is a deal -- it's not uncommon for everybody to consider the self-interest of all the parties involved. Lawyers (ph) (inaudible) cutting their own political deal and selling the United States Senate seat. MR. FITZGERALD: And I understand we're not -- you know, there's politics and there's crime. And sometimes, I think, when people get in trouble, they try and blur those lines. I think, when you start having quid pro quos, where there's a deal, if you give me this and I will give that, in exchange for rewards; if you tell someone -- if you read the complaint carefully, one of the conversations describes how the job that Governor Blagojevich wanted for himself with the union couldn't be just given to him by the union because they already have people doing that job.
us/politics,So, when you say you want a job for four years; you want a salary of about $300,000, and you basically want to work on behalf of a union and cost them $1.2 million to basically add no value, because people are already doing your job, and part of that is an exchange, where -- an exchange, if you don't get that job, no one's getting the appointed Senate seat, we're comfortable in the law that someone who schemes to do that has broken the law. And we're not trying to criminalize people making political horse trades on policies or that sort of thing. But it is criminal when people are doing it for their personal enrichment and they're doing it in a way that is, in this case, clearly criminal. QUESTION: What advice would you give to anybody who would now take a senatorial (ph) appointment from Rod Blagojevich? FITZGERALD: I -- I'm -- I'm going to duck that one. (LAUGHTER) OK. Yes, sir? QUESTION: We understand the governor was taken to the FBI headquarters this morning. MR. FITZGERALD: Yes. QUESTION: Was he interviewed there? And did he make any kind of a statement? MR. FITZGERALD: I'm not allowed to comment on whether anyone made a statement. But he was arrested and taken to the FBI. QUESTION: Was he interviewed? MR. FITZGERALD: I don't think... QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) MR. FITZGERALD: I don't know if I can comment on whether we attempted to interview him, under the rules. I can't comment on that.
us/politics,QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) the arrest? MR. FITZGERALD: Sorry? QUESTION: Could Mr. Grant describe the arrest? There were no cameras there, no witnesses, apparently. Can you explain how it happened? MR. GRANT: It occurred about six o'clock in the morning, and it was a phone call from me to the governor, advising him that we had a warrant for his arrest, that there were two FBI agents outside his door; asked him to open the door so we could do this as quietly, without the media finding out about it, without waking the children. He was very cooperative, and that's it. QUESTION: Was he handcuffed? MR. GRANT: Yes, which is normal, standard practice for us. QUESTION: What did he say on the phone? MR. GRANT: First question? QUESTION: What did he say to you? MR. GRANT: Well, I woke him up. So the first thing was, was this a joke? But I'll leave the rest -- you know, he tried to make sure this was an honest call. So... QUESTION: How about his family? Was his wife there when this happened? And his children, did they wake up? MR. GRANT: They did not wake up that I know of. They were beginning to stir as we left, but they were not awake and not aware. But his wife was awake. QUESTION: There a rumor that (inaudible) visit his house within the past couple of weeks. Did you talk to him about this ongoing case? (inaudible) cooperate? MR. GRANT: I can't -- I can't comment on that.
us/politics,QUESTION: How long were you at the house? QUESTION: (inaudible) when did you make the decision to actually arrest him rather than allow him to turn himself in, to sort of send a signal here? MR. GRANT: It was exactly what Pat said earlier, and that was, we had a -- we have a lot of things we learned from the wiretap, a lot of things we learned from these microphones. There is a lot of investigation that still needs to be done. And there are critical interviews that we have to do and cooperation we need to get from different people. So it wasn't about, as Pat said, tying this in a bow, waiting until spring, letting things be done that damaged the state of Illinois, damaged the United States Senate, hurt people. It was about what is good for the investigation? What is good to find out the truth about what is going on? Because this goes beyond just the governor. It goes to other people who are involved in these schemes. QUESTION: Mr. Fitzgerald, would you make clear just something about the timing here? When the Tribune ran its story a few days ago revealing that the governor was being taped, would you explain -- and I think some of this is laid out in the complaint -- did further taping take place or did that essentially terminate your ability to listen in?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: Well, what I would say is, to back up and to the extent that there have been articles, I'm not confirming or denying the accuracy of the articles. You can compare them against what happened. I will say this, as you guys know, you guys are in the information business of getting it and publishing it, and we're in the information business of getting it and using it. About eight weeks ago, before we had the bug installed and before we had the wiretap up, we were contacted by the Tribune to comment or confirm or deny on a story that they were going to run. Had they ran that story, we thought we'd never have the opportunity to install the bug or place the telephone tap. And we made an urgent request for the Tribune not to publish that story. That is a very rare thing for us to do and it's an even rarer thing for a newspaper to grant. We thought that the public interest required that the story not run. It was a difficult conversation to have because we weren't allowed to describe what we doing, and I have to take my hat off that the Tribune withheld that story for a substantial period of time, which otherwise might have compromised the investigation for ever happening. And I think that's something that we should take note of.
us/politics,And later, at a later point in time that story did run. I believe it ran on Friday morning. And we were recording after the story ran that said feds tape of Blagojevich, and as set forth in the complaint, days before, or even the day before that story ran, Governor Blagojevich was intercepted telling his fund-raiser to have that conversation about wanting to see campaign contributions up front and telling him to talk as if the whole world is listening; be careful, do it in person, not over the telephone. And then, after the story ran, we got a different conversation the next day, which basically says, undo what you just did. So it was clear that the reaction to the story was to think that they shouldn't proceed down that road. So to the extent that we had a number of weeks of interception (inaudible) the telephone, I do -- I do think we -- we ought to credit the Chicago Tribune that they agreed to that request. They didn't agree to all our requests. As you might imagine, they saw it differently than we did. But I appreciate that and respect what they did. QUESTION: (inaudible) you are always very careful to separate politics from law enforcement, but as you stand here and outline a case that's been described as shocking, disgusting, sickening, appalling, the worst ever, and Rob (ph) talking about if Illinois is not the most corrupt, it's in serious contention, you now have a governor facing these charges, and perhaps many, many more, who still has the power to appoint a U.S. senator.
us/politics,And I'm wondering, even though it's a statutory provision, would the people of Illinois be well served by a quick special session of the legislature to try to change the law? You were quick to make value judgments about good and bad behavior. How about weighing in on a matter of civic -- of civic responsibility? MR. FITZGERALD: I think there's enough people here who can weigh in on their opinions about things, and the citizens can weigh in with their opinions. The U.S. attorney's office and the FBI do not have an opinion on what actions the legislature ought take. The only opinion we'll express is that we hope that people with relevant information will come forward and cooperate with us. QUESTION: Well, do you trust the governor of Illinois to make this appointment? (CROSSTALK) MR. FITZGERALD: OK. QUESTION: Pat, you're a citizen of the state of Illinois. MR. FITZGERALD: OK. QUESTION: You live here in Chicago. Do you trust this governor to make a good choice for the Senate, which is so important? MR. FITZGERALD: I am a citizen of Illinois, and I do have opinions and beliefs. And what they are, are for me, because when I speak, I speak on behalf of that seal, and that seal has no opinion on that matter. QUESTION: Can you just confirm, so as the investigation continues there could be additional counts added against these defendants and others? MR. FITZGERALD: What we'll simply say is the investigation continues. We're not going to predict that other charges will or will not be filed.
us/politics,QUESTION: You spoke before about if Senator -- you didn't know the awareness that Senator -- or President-elect Barack Obama knew about this. So is it safe to say he has not been briefed? And can you also tell us if any phone calls that were made to President-elect Obama that you intercepted, or to Rahm Emanuel? MR. FITZGERALD: Anna, I'm not going to go down anything that's not in the complaint. And what I simply said before is, I'm not -- I have enough trouble speaking for myself, I'm never going to try to speak in the voice of a president or president-elect. So I simply pointed out that if you look at the complaint, there's no allegation that the president-elect -- there's no reference in the complaint to any conversation involving the president-elect or indicating that the president-elect was aware of it, and that's all I can say. QUESTION: What will be your position -- what will be your position at this afternoon's hearing on detention for bond for the governor? MR. FITZGERALD: I don't expect there's going to be a contentious issue about bond, but we'll -- we'll -- Magistrate, Judge Nan Nolan (ph) will be handling that proceeding. I think she can hear the specifics from us for the first time in court. But... QUESTION: (inaudible) MR. FITZGERALD: I think Judge Nolan should hear what our position is, not through your excellent reporting, but through our assistance, telling it what it is. (CROSSTALK) MR. FITZGERALD: Sorry, (inaudible)?
us/politics,QUESTION: (inaudible) categorize (inaudible) compared to other (inaudible)? How would you categorize it? MR. FITZGERALD: I'm not going to go beyond saying that just, we -- the conduct we think is appalling, and I'm not going to do a comparative to other cases, but I just think it's very, very disturbing that we have these pay-to-play allegations going on for years. And that they picked up steam after a conviction, they picked up steam after an ethics in government act, and that it would go so far as to taint the process by which the governor and his inner circle of advisers were choosing someone to take a seat in the United States Senate to represent Illinois. (CROSSTALK) MR. FITZGERALD: Sir? QUESTION: (inaudible) took herself out of the running after this was made apparent to her? Can we gather that is Congressman (inaudible)? MR. FITZGERALD: I'm not going to confirm or deny any names with numbers. I just can't. QUESTION: You name the governor's wife in this. (inaudible) in the -- in the charges. Can you recount for us what she said and what her role was, as it's laid out in the charts? MR. FITZGERALD: Since I don't -- since I won't quote it accurately, there's a paragraph, I believe, that describes a situation in which she describes the interaction Tribune, who owns the Cubs and the editorial board, and she is part of the conversation with the governor and others making suggestions as to what should happen.
us/politics,There may be another reference or two in the complaint. And since I can't call them up with precision and I don't want to start reading the complaint in front of all of you, I think I'll just leave you to looking at the complaint and... QUESTION: If she says what the governor (inaudible) why wouldn't she be charged if she's saying the same thing? MR. FITZGERALD: I'm not going to comment on anyone not charged. Simply say that there's a description of a conversation that took place in the complaint, and leave it at that. QUESTION: Mr. Fitzgerald, did you have a conversation with the attorney general or somebody close to him either regarding the ability for you to get the wiretaps (inaudible) on the home or is that the decision to file this complaint? MR. FITZGERALD: I will say this. One, when it comes to wiretaps and bugs, I think the procedure we follow is a -- is well known. To file a wiretap, first of all, you need the FBI -- Boston, Chicago, whose people are doing all the work -- to be on board. You need my office to be on board. That gets you no where. You got to go down to Washington to Office of Enforcement Operations, OEO. And you probably have never heard of OEO, and you'll see "CSI" on TV -- and the people in OEO do a fantastic job. They are the people who review, among other things, applications for wiretaps and bugs, and they scrub them. And they're very smart.
us/politics,And what we like about OEO is they know how to say yes and they know how to say no. And if they don't think it meets the standards, they'll tell you that and you won't get your wiretap or bug. And they think it does, they'll say yes. And if it needs fixing, they fix it. An effort is approved in the office of OEO. It then goes up through the chain to high-ranking officials in the criminal division who sign off on it. And once it's been signed off at main Justice which says you're allowed to go see it, you're still nowhere because you can't put a bug or a wiretap in without the approval of the chief judge in the district. So the chief judge takes an independent review and signs off on it. We complied with all that, obviously. Beyond that, what I'll simply say is that no one -- the deputy attorney general, the FBI director or the attorney general -- aren't going to drop their coffee this morning to find out about this case for the first time. We've, obviously, kept them briefed and -- but beyond that, we'll -- we'll take responsibility for the decisions we made and leave it at that. QUESTION: I got a question -- if you could also just clarify again, is discussing a quid pro quo where he, you know, acted criminally versus actually carrying out. I mean, if he's just having conversations about eliminating a member of the editorial board at the Chicago Tribune but nothing is actually carried out, how much of that is just someone trying to be a tough guy and how much of that is criminal behaviors?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: Well, you hit on two questions. One is a legal distinction. There is scheming or conspiracy to commit a crime and then there's a substantive crime. We've charged conspiracy or scheming in this complaint. One of the things we want to do with this investigation is to track out the different schemes and conspiracies to find out which ones were carried out or not and who might be involved in that or not. And that's something we haven't done yet. Now that we've gone overt we'll be interviewing people and figuring that out. But it is a crime in and of itself for people to scheme to violate the law. That's called conspiracy. Then there's a substantive crime. As far as how much -- whether or not there people acting like a tough guy or not, I don't want to pre-try the case, but if you lean on someone and leave them to believe their bill is not getting signed unless they give you the money, that is what acting like a tough guy is, it's a crime. And we can sort through it at any trial as to what was said, what was followed through, but it is a crime to conspire to shake someone down. QUESTION: Is the governor being held in (inaudible) jail at the moment? MR. FITZGERALD: I believe he's probably somewhere in the building, and he'll be presented in front of Judge Miller.
us/politics,QUESTION: (inaudible) when asking about the taping, the governor said that -- he invoked the names "Nixon" and "Watergate." Isn't essentially what the government did here under the authority of a wiretap court order the same thing? Didn't FBI agents have to break into the governor's office in order to plant these? MR. FITZGERALD: And -- I'm not going to compare FBI agents enforcing the law, trying to stop a senator from auctioning off a Senate seat or shutting $8 million out of a children's hospital from being pulled back or stopping people for greasing the skids to get a bill, or get someone fired with Nixon. It just -- it doesn't fly. What we did was lawful. QUESTION: Sir, just to be crystal clear and to make clear, you're not aware of any conversations then that took place with the governor and any member of Barack Obama's transition team, at all? MR. FITZGERALD: And what I simply said is you can read the complaint. I'm not going to sit here with a 76-page complaint and parse through it. That's all we're alleging. And I'm just -- I'm not going to start going down and saying, did anyone ever talk to anyone? You can read what we allege in the complaint. It's pretty detailed. Look in the 76 pages. And if you don't see it, it's not there. QUESTION: You talked about -- you talked about keeping your superiors informed as to what was going on, I'm assuming that means the attorney general.
us/politics,In the briefings that President-elect Obama had had over the past week with various government departments, would it be possible for him to have been briefed on what was going on here with regard to this investigation? MR. FITZGERALD: I -- I -- I -- I'm not going to comment on that. I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not the briefer. I'm not at those meetings. But I would simply say that this was very close hold in Washington, and on a need to know basis. So, I'm -- but I'm not going to -- I'm not the briefer, so I'm not going to represent what happens. But -- I'll leave it at that. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: You said that this morning you've already gotten calls that were heartening. Could you assign a number to that in terms of the meaningful individuals that you're really searching for as this thing goes forward (inaudible)? MR. FITZGERALD: I'll just say that, you know, I'm not going to describe who it was or what it was, but, you know, someone reported in as to a conversation, and I felt very, very happy. It was just sort of like, OK, good. You know, that one sort of brought it home. I've -- you know, I've tried to speak at times about telling people that, you know, you look to the FBI to do a lot. You look to law enforcement to do a lot. But the real effort to clean up corruption is going to start with the citizenry, people who are going to speak up and say something when it's wrong.
us/politics,And when you reach out to contact someone to say, "Do you know anything?" and they say, "Oh, boy do I. And let me tell what you I know, and I remember details," that tells you there are people out there who are pretty damn angry and are willing to step up to the plate and say, "I'm not going to complain about it. I'm going to do something about it." QUESTION: (inaudible) the governor's known he's been under investigation for several years now. And yet he was still engaged allegedly in this kind of activity. What does it say about the audacity of the governor (inaudible) he's under investigation and knows it? MR. FITZGERALD: I'll leave that for you to draw your own conclusions. It's a pretty audacious set of conversations set forth in the complaint in the circumstances. QUESTION: Which union was the governor (inaudible) in exchange for the Senate appointment? MR. FITZGERALD: I think it's laid out in the complaint that it's a -- that the person he discussed, or the union he discussed getting a job with. And, again, I'm not going to describe more than is in the complaint. But the scheme that he had in mind with co-defendant Harris was a job with a coalition called "Change to Win," which was affiliated with SEIU, which is the Service Employees International Union. And that was their, you know, their scheme to sell the seat in that three-way exchange.
us/politics,That never happened. That scheme did not come to fruition. He curses later that it didn't happen. But the one being discussed was the SEIU union. Anyone else in the back? Sorry. QUESTION: (inaudible) comment at all on the (inaudible) governor's office (inaudible)? MR. FITZGERALD: I -- I don't think it's the governor's office at the Thompson Center. There's a search warrant -- can we say where? It's at the office of a deputy governor, and there's a search warrant being executed at the friends of Blagojevich campaign headquarters. (CROSSTALK) MR. FITZGERALD: One more. I just want to get -- I want to make sure. QUESTION: This investigation has been going on for years now, (inaudible) -- what's been happening to the other lines of investigation (inaudible)? MR. FITZGERALD: They will still be followed. If you look at the complaint, it cites back to wire-tapped conversations from the -- from the conversations we wire-tapped way back in 2004, and we've been filing charges based upon that wire-tap, up until quite recently. And we will take all the existing strands of the investigations that -- some of which you know about, some of which you don't, and we will take this and we will process it and figure out as much as we can. And what we'd really like to do is add a whole lot more information from the people out there who may know something. Yes?
us/politics,QUESTION: I haven't read through the entire complaint yet, but I'm wondering if there's an indication that the governor was trying to secure employment for himself and/or the (inaudible), because he thought he might get indicted, because he thought he might not win the election? What was he -- what was he... MR. FITZGERALD: I think he -- there were quotes in there; he wants to make some money, he's got to think of his future. He did -- does talk about getting more income for himself, more income for his wife, and does talk about the prospect of appointing himself. That puts him in a better position if he's indicted. And I won't go beyond the complaint, but all three issues are discussed in the complaint. I'll get the person -- either you're fixing a camera or raising your hand. QUESTION: (inaudible) matter of law, a question of law. If it's against the law to sell and trade a job or a contact, is it also against the law to try to buy one? In other words, if you're a politician offering the governor $500,000 in campaign cash in exchange for the Senate seat and discussing it, you might be willing to raise that kind of money (inaudible) -- are you culpable, or is that just horse-trading? MR. FITZGERALD: I'm not -- I'm not... QUESTION: Not mentioning names.
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: ... OK. I'm not going to get into hypotheticals that you'll abstract from the complaint and start going down that road. I will say we charged Governor Blagojevich and Mr. Harris, that's all we're saying. And we'll do further investigation and we'll get behind what we can and different transactions, and I'm not going to prejudge any matter whatsoever. (CROSSTALK) MR. FITZGERALD: Yes? (UNKNOWN): (inaudible) MR. FITZGERALD: OK, Rob? QUESTION: I was just wondering if -- I haven't read the whole complaint either -- is Rezko -- is he going to be testifying in front of (inaudible) at all, and is -- is (inaudible)? MR. FITZGERALD: I think there's a that Mr. Rezko, with a footnote, somewhere in the complaint, and I couldn't tell you the footnote number, but if you look there, there's a succinct summary of his status in that footnote that I won't try to repeat out loud. And, yes, who's next? Natasha? QUESTION: (inaudible) talk about (inaudible) -- that you were checking it out and just trying to see what the status. MR. FITZGERALD: And I think I'm not going to go beyond that footnote. We didn't rely upon his information in the complaint, but it doesn't -- give a definitive view on his status; it describes what his status is. MR. GRANT: (OFF-MIKE) and that's it, folks. MR. FITZGERALD: OK. OK? QUESTION: If a Tribune executive did agree to fire somebody in the editorial board as an exchange for this, would it be criminal behavior? And can you characterize at all how far the Tribune plot went?
us/politics,MR. FITZGERALD: I'm not going to say how far the Tribute plot went, other than the person who was identified as a person to be fired was not fired and still works there today. Beyond that, I'm not going to try and walk back where the -- where the scheme went, from a pretty explicit scheme by Governor Blagojevich, as described in the complaint, describing to Harris, and then Harris basically saying, I'm going to be more subtle about it, and Governor Blagojevich saying, well, do it -- do it the appropriate way. We don't go beyond that. And I'm not going to opine on if, what and when, as to what happened once the conversation left the two people charged, Governor Blagojevich and Harris. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) MR. FITZGERALD: Yes. QUESTION: You spoke very directly about why these indictments had to come now. Conversely, given the fact that all this is now out in the open, is it possible that anyone appointed to the Senate seat by Governor Blagojevich could do so and take office without there being a cloud over his or her head? MR. FITZGERALD: First of all, there's not an indictment, realize. It's a complaint. So I don't want people to understand it's an indictment. We filed a criminal complaint. And I'm not getting into where things stand in the Senate seat, other than that we've -- there's an ugly episode that we've aired. We've brought charges, will proceed, and the public discourse will go its way without our guidance.
us/politics,QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said this morning he'd (ph) like to see impeachment proceedings begin as early as (OFF-MIKE) I understand impeachment is somewhat -- something like a trial. Would you assist them, in any sense, with any of the evidence (OFF- MIKE) MR. FITZGERALD: I thought about a lot of things this morning. That one hasn't come up yet, and I'm not going to take it off the top of my head and swing. So we'll go from there. MR. GRANT: Thank you very much, folks.

The personal-computer and Internet revolution that began in the late 20th century eventually took over most of the world, but its most prominent players — Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, Microsoft — were distinctly American. In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China. That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China’s ascension as a global economic power, and if you’ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him. We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as “Alibaba,” Duncan Clark’s engaging biography explains, Ma’s humble origins gave no clue to his future — then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.
books/review,After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies — beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping — seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea. If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma’s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. “I was treated like a con man for three years,” Ma said. Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late ’90s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma’s “China Pages” and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).
books/review,Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma’s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and “Forrest Gump.” Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government’s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.
arts/design,A Barrier or a Fair Fee? Readers React to the Met’s New Admission Policy - The New York Times The New York Times reported last week that the Metropolitan Museum of Art would begin charging adults from outside New York State a mandatory $25 fee for admission beginning March 1. The reaction to the news was divided. Our chief art critics, Roberta Smith and Holland Cotter, disagreed with the Met’s decision, saying such museums should be free. “It divides people into categories — rich and poor, native and foreign,” Ms. Smith wrote. Some readers, however, said it was fair to charge out-of-town visitors a fee to enter a cultural institution like the Met. The pay-as-you-wish admission price will continue for all residents of New York, as well as for students who live in New Jersey and Connecticut. But for the thousands or workers who commute to New York, it will no longer be an option. We gathered reaction from readers, who weighed in on the policy in our comments section. Responses have been edited for clarity and length. This is a disgrace. Decision makers at the Met obviously have no idea what $25 means to ordinary people. A $25 entrance fee is a barrier. Museums should not put up barriers. They should reach out. I am disappointed in this museum that has long had a place in my heart for its generosity in sharing humanity’s great treasures. My feeling for it is being lost. SUBITO CORVALLIS
arts/design,We may as well impose a fee to walk through our city’s beautiful Central Park, or to view our city’s architecture, or perhaps even charge for a glimpse at the Statue of Liberty for that matter. Art is to be appreciated by every human being no matter where on our planet they hail from and no matter their economic status. NOO YAWKA American children up to the age of 18 should have free access. In France, I bought yearly passes for myself to all museums. My daughters could get in free because they were French citizens. Kids need more than videos! MO FRANCE I have a feeling that many of the people complaining willingly spend hundreds of dollars for a ticket to a Broadway show and/or then visit MoMA and other museums that are charging $25 with no complaints. And a $25 ticket that includes admittance to the Met’s three museums is a huge bargain. LOLA Although I agree, in theory, with almost every argument against mandatory admission fees for out-of-town visitors, budget constraints are real. This policy tries to “hurt the fewest” of many alternatives. The Met is a world treasure and should be kept open and accessible to all. Charging out-of-town visitors a modest fee so that it remains operational is fair. AMYF
arts/design,The Met is a city museum with a national focus. It is fair to say that the taxpayers of New York already shoulder a large part of the costs for the Met and deserve a better break. I have maintained an out-of-town membership for more than a decade, and, when in town, I visit as much as I want. Prorated, it is not a bad deal. Cut these guys a break. They have to make the books balance. ARVEY The Met is fabulous, and $25 is reasonable considering what you see. But $25 is high for many people, especially families. I wonder if the Met ever considered different pricing, such as a flat rate of $10 for everyone or surge pricing? By appearing to lower the price, the Met could actually make a lot more money. PADRAIG LEWIS Living in Hoboken, I can get to the Met just as fast as those in some of the boroughs. That said, I do want to continue to have the Met in existence and be better than the institution it currently is, so I support the need for a mandatory admission. I just wish it was applied to all visitors and perhaps at a lesser cost. CJFILM The Cleveland Museum of Art — one of the best in the country — does not charge admission, but it does charge for special exhibits. I think that is a better option for the Met — I would have gladly paid extra to see the current Michelangelo exhibit. KAREN
world/americas,A Mayor Fluent in Twitter Embodies a New Canadian Diversity - The New York Times CALGARY, Canada — Officially, Naheed Nenshi, the mayor of this oil-fueled city, is meant to be addressed as Your Worship, a stuffy, colonial-era honorific that has somehow managed to survive Canada’s transformation into a modern, multicultural nation. “It’s weird,” Mr. Nenshi, a rotund, curly-haired 44-year-old, said one recent afternoon as he sat behind the large wooden desk that dominates his office. In practice, Mr. Nenshi is far more likely to be addressed as @nenshi, his Twitter handle, which he wields with obsessive, daily devotion. At any given moment, he can be found shepherding constituents’ queries to relevant government agencies or firing off sarcastic retorts to his detractors, who are usually complaining about the use of their tax dollars. His faith rarely comes up, if at all. For a Muslim man who broke ground when he was elected mayor of a major North American city in 2010, Mr. Nenshi has proved that very few Canadians have a problem with how His Worship actually worships. “Nobody cared,” he said, recalling his first win, a success he repeated in 2013, with 74 percent of the vote. The son of ethnic South Asian immigrants from Tanzania and a professed public transit nerd, Mr. Nenshi has thrived in a city and country where personal attacks and cultural issues capture little of the political oxygen that has inflamed voters in the United States and Europe.
world/americas,Indeed, after London elected its first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, in May amid a campaign tinged with Islamophobic sentiment, Calgarians were rather pleased that their city had demonstrated a penchant for tolerance long ago. Even as hijabs have come to outnumber cowboy hats on the streets of Calgary, a city of more than 1.2 million in Alberta just a few hours north of the Montana border, local opposition has focused on issues like bike lanes and affordable housing, rather than Shariah law or the arrival of Syrian refugees. The city’s demographic shift is a microcosm of Canada’s integration of immigrants, and Mr. Nenshi, who fasts during Ramadan and has led Calgary’s gay pride parade, embodies the country’s increasingly diverse population. Still, Mr. Nenshi is the first nonwhite mayor of Calgary and among the few in a nation that is 80 percent white, according to a 2011 government survey. Then there is Mr. Nenshi’s fixation with purple. The color symbolizes his commitment to inclusive, nonideological government and dominates his professional wardrobe: lavender dress shirts, violet ties, purple shoelaces, loafers the color of grapes. A local rabbi gave him a purple skullcap, shipped from New York, inscribed with his name. In his office hallway, a framed illustration depicts the mayor as a caped superhero in purple spandex. Born in Toronto and raised in a Calgary neighborhood that was already a mix of cultures and languages, Mr. Nenshi grew up keenly aware of the need for civic participation. After obtaining a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard, he worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company before returning to Calgary, where he eventually became a university professor, teaching nonprofit management and marketing.
world/americas,Mr. Nenshi’s journey into government reads like a do-it-yourself guide to disrupting politics as usual. For years, he pursued his wonkish passions strictly from an academic distance, writing reports on how Canadian cities, including Calgary, could become more environmentally sustainable and economically competitive. A failed run for the City Council in 2004 confirmed his role as an outsider. But five years later, with elections for the Council and mayor looming in 2010, he began encouraging corporate chief executives, soccer moms and other Calgary residents to run. “I struck out every time,” he recalled. Then friends challenged him to run for mayor, an idea he initially rejected. “I like research; I do the data,” he said. “I’m not the guy kissing the babies.” But the campaign proved a tempting chance for Mr. Nenshi to turn years of public policy recommendations into action. Along with a group of volunteers that encompassed Calgary’s diverse population, the college professor created a grass-roots strategy aimed at harnessing social media’s potential to engage the city’s traditionally apathetic young and minority residents. Branded the Purple Revolution, Mr. Nenshi’s campaign used Facebook and Twitter to discuss issues directly with Calgary residents. Supporters opened their homes for caffeine-infused parties at which the candidate spoke, and they organized huge rallies to cheer him on. While such tactics may seem obvious today, at the time they were novelties in Canadian politics. So were the results: Mr. Nenshi won nearly 40 percent of the votes in a crowded field, amid the highest turnout in four decades.
world/americas,Mr. Nenshi’s zeal for change has fueled the city’s revitalization and raised its profile beyond oil and the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo and festival that is Canada’s equivalent of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. A few blocks from his office, gleaming, mixed-income residential and commercial buildings rise in the downtown East Village neighborhood, once home to vacant lots and high crime rates. A new library and National Music Center are set to open there soon, and dozens of food trucks now ply the streets. Outside the city, the Calgary Film Center, which opened in May and was funded partly by the City Council, features sprawling sound stages and studio space intended to lure more film and television projects to the city. The center is a major element in Calgary’s strategy to diversify the local economy beyond the oil and gas industry, which has suffered as the price of oil has plummeted in recent years. More than 33 miles of bicycle paths have been installed across Calgary since 2011. Despite vocal opposition and a close City Council vote, Mr. Nenshi championed a downtown bike network pilot project that was built last year and is now favored by most residents. “Nenshi has always been the guy who can help people get motivated to bring about change,” said James Boettcher, a Calgary gelato entrepreneur who pitched the idea of food trucks to the mayor in 2011.
world/americas,Mr. Nenshi said he has no desire to seek higher office. Instead, he has embraced the role of Calgary’s head cheerleader. There he was on a recent afternoon, speaking in the indigenous Blackfoot language before a crowd of film industry executives, then posing for selfies at a bar across town on National Caesar Day, which celebrates a uniquely Canadian concoction that includes tomato juice, vodka, Worcestershire sauce and clam broth. (His cocktail was virgin.) The mayor’s popular personal style, which he says is perhaps too unscripted, comes with some risks. “My mouth still gets me into trouble once in a while,” he said. Much of that public interaction occurs on Twitter, starting when he wakes up in the morning and continuing until lights out. “Nobody else has my password,” he said, explaining his more than 47,000 Twitter messages as a vital means of addressing constituents’ needs and improving municipal government. “If I don’t know the answer sometimes, I Google it for them.” Mr. Nenshi is perhaps most famous beyond Calgary for his online “smackdowns.” These range from giving polite advice to a driver who demanded an end to parking tickets (“I don’t know, maybe consider not breaking the law”) to challenging personal insults. (“Your casual racism can be fun, but you really need to stop before people actually notice.”) Still, he is happy to inspire his critics to do more than just rant online, even if that means being voted out of office. As he told one Twitter user eager for his electoral defeat: “You’ll get your chance in 2017! Better start organizing now, though.”
us/politics,Donald Trump’s Apology That Wasn’t - The New York Times For hours on Friday night, the political world waited for the rarest of expressions from Donald J. Trump — a heartfelt apology. What viewers got was anything but. During a 90-second videotaped appearance, Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, offered a strikingly brief articulation of regret for a decade-old audiotape in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals and said he could have his way with women because of his fame. But his real message, which appeared early Saturday, was one of defiance. He described the controversy that upended the Republican Party for most of Friday as a mere “distraction,” and said that his vulgar remarks captured on the tape were nothing compared with the way Bill and Hillary Clinton had mistreated women. If anything, Mr. Trump’s videotaped statement was a truncated version of a speech that he had given countless times. And it did not reflect the several hours of conference calls and strategy meetings among his top aides, who were at first stunned and then nearly paralyzed by the revelation of the tape, which they worried would be fatal to his White House hopes. “That took 10 hours?” an incredulous Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, asked on CNN immediately after the statement. With his brow furrowed and his face a tight scowl, Mr. Trump sat hunched in a chair inside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, with the glittering nighttime New York City skyline behind him.
us/politics,“I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not,” said Mr. Trump, a 70-year-old real estate developer and former reality television star. Then came the apologetic part. “I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more-than-a-decade-old video are one of them,” Mr. Trump said of the hot-mike recording of him bragging to Billy Bush, then the host of NBC’s “Access Hollywood,” about his groping and uninvited kissing of women. “Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” Mr. Trump continued. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,” he said. Oddly, Mr. Trump seemed to frame his comments not as sincere concern about those he may have hurt or offended, but as part of his own journey, describing his growth as a person and how humbling it has been for him to campaign across the nation and learn of other people’s worries and travails. “I’ve traveled the country talking about change for America, but my travels have also changed me,” he said, describing meeting mothers who have lost children and people who have lost their jobs. “I pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down,” Mr. Trump said. Grudging though they seemed, Mr. Trump’s comments were a marked departure from his lifelong resistance to any admission of fault. Mr. Trump values strength and power and disparages weakness. His usual response, when criticized or hurt, has been to counterpunch forcefully.
us/politics,Before the release of the short statement, advisers to Mr. Trump had huddled with him at Trump Tower, along with his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, to discuss how to respond to the crisis. The advisers cautioned against holding a news conference, something that had been discussed, because it could become unwieldy and spin out of his control. They realized they needed to address the issue quickly, at a minimum to try to stop the defections of Republican officials who had begun to shun and loudly denounce him. But one adviser to Mr. Trump cautioned before the statement that if the candidate mentioned Mrs. Clinton, it would fail. Mr. Trump did just that. “Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.” Mr. Trump then turned the focus to his second debate against Mrs. Clinton, less than 48 hours away. Ever the performer and intimidator, he added, with a hint of menace in his voice: “We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.”
sports/ncaafootball,A.C.C. Moves Football Championship Game to Orlando - The New York Times The Atlantic Coast Conference’s football championship game, typically played in Charlotte, N.C., but pulled from the state earlier this month in response to a controversial North Carolina law, will be staged at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla., in December, the conference announced Thursday. As previously scheduled, the game, between the winners of the Atlantic and Coastal Divisions, will kick off the evening of Saturday, Dec. 3. Earlier this month, the A.C.C., a North Carolina-based conference that counts four universities in the state among its most prominent members, announced that it would move all of its neutral-site championship events out of the state for the coming academic year in response to a law, known as House Bill 2, that is seen to discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. That move came several days after the N.C.A.A. made a similar announcement about its championships, and a few months after the N.B.A. pulled its 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte. The A.C.C. championship game is no stranger to the state of Florida, and two teams in the state, Florida State and Miami, are conference members. But this is the first time the game will be held in Orlando.
us/politics,Martin O’Malley to Drop Out After Finish in Iowa Vote - The New York Times Martin O’Malley, the former Democratic governor of Maryland, and Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, ended their presidential campaigns Monday night after disappointing finishes in the Iowa caucuses. Mr. O’Malley, facing only two opponents, finished with less than one percent of the vote. “Tonight I have to tell you that I am ending this presidential bid,” he told supporters in Des Moines, “but I am not ending this fight.” Mr. Huckabee fared almost as poorly, earning less than 2 percent of his party’s support. “I am officially suspending my campaign,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for all your loyal support.” Mr. O’Malley, also a former mayor of Baltimore, never gained traction in the small Democratic field, failing to capture the interest — much less the hearts — of most voters. He was outflanked by Hillary Clinton, whose message of pragmatic competence has helped drive a campaign that offers Democrats the chance to make history by electing the first female president, and by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose populist message of fighting Wall Street and the nation’s big banks has electrified the Democratic base. Mr. Sanders seized much of the progressive enthusiasm that Mr. O’Malley had hoped to capture. The former governor seemed unwilling to attack Mrs. Clinton, and failed to harness the anti-establishment anger that Mr. Sanders so ably channeled.
us/politics,To help prop up his campaign, Mr. O’Malley took out a loan last year. The borrowing came as he stopped paying many of his aides since moving them to Iowa. On Sunday, his campaign said he was over $500,000 in debt and had just $169,444 cash on hand. Mr. O’Malley, 53, tried to highlight his relative youth by strumming his guitar in bars (and, once, on Wall Street). He had hoped to win over working-class white voters, but in Iowa fell well below the 15 percent in most precincts to be considered “viable.” If a candidate was not viable, his or her supporters instead became fair game for viable candidates. At one caucus in Indianola, Iowa, the few O’Malley supporters who showed up were not sure they would reach the minimum.  “We’re pretty realistic,” Nicholas Webb, 31, a lawyer, said. “I came in pretty much knowing it was unlikely we’d get to 15 percent.” His mother, Ellen Webb, nodded. “I think they’re going to target us,” she said, looking out at the larger groups of people supporting Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. But a small group of voters were still undecided. When one said “the Benghazi movie” made her uneasy about Mrs. Clinton, Margaret Vernon, who was in the O’Malley camp, went to her side. “That’s why you may want to consider Martin O’Malley,” she said, smiling. “He doesn’t have that baggage.”
us/politics,Mr. O’Malley’s supporters at the Indianola caucus did, in the end, get just enough support, and their candidate eked out one of the 10 delegates chosen there. But just a short while later, Mr. O’Malley was preparing to announce that he would be dropping out of the race, making that delegate moot. Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher and onetime host of his own Fox News show, won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, but needed a strong finish in the state, with its deeply religious and conservative base, to justify continuing on this time around. With a new book, “God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,” that embodied his folksy charm, Mr. Huckabee again campaigned with Chuck Norris, the action movie star and martial artist who had helped add a twist of whimsy — and tough talk — to Mr. Huckabee’s previous presidential bid. But facing an angry, frustrated Republican electorate, Mr. Huckabee’s wit and homey appeal failed to electrify, and he was cut from the main debate stage as his poll numbers stagnated Nonetheless, he hoped to turn out voters in Iowa. He completed the “Full Grassley” — visiting all of Iowa’s 99 counties, in a feat named after the state’s senior senator, Charles E. Grassley — and made 150 stops in the state in January alone, according to his campaign. He also seemed to resort to attention-getting stunts, taking reporters to a shooting range and appearing with Donald J. Trump at an event in Des Moines that coincided with the most recent prime-time debate, which Mr. Trump had boycotted (and which Mr. Huckabee did not qualify for).
arts,Sad Day for Gotham: Adam West, Who Played Batman, Dies at 88 - The New York Times Adam West, the classically handsome baritone actor who turned a comic-book superhero into live-action Pop Art in the 1960s television series “Batman,” died on Friday in Los Angeles. He was 88. The cause was leukemia, according to Molly Schoneveld, a family spokeswoman. “Batman” lasted only two and a half seasons, from January 1966 to March 1968. But the show was such a phenomenon that Mr. West appeared in costume on the cover of Life magazine, the highest tribute to national popularity at the time. The show’s off-kilter camera angles and superimposed dialogue balloons representing fight-scene sound effects like “pow!” and “splat!” were among the elements that led it to be viewed as high camp. Mr. West dismissed that label but proudly described the show as farce. Batman, the crime-fighting alias of Bruce Wayne, a bachelor millionaire in Gotham City, was created as a comic-book character in 1939 by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. (He was soon joined by a young sidekick, Robin the Boy Wonder.) Mr. West’s television version was painfully clean-cut, a milk-drinking model citizen whose reaction to extreme frustration might be, “He’s right, darn it!” Two episodes were broadcast each week for most of the show’s run and featured a number of celebrity guest stars. In addition to well-known villains like the Penguin, played by Burgess Meredith, and the Joker, played by Cesar Romero, visiting stars included Zsa Zsa Gabor, Milton Berle and Liberace.
arts,The review of the first episode in The New York Times was qualified, declaring the show “amusing in spots.” Mr. West, it said, had “the jaw, height and sternness for the part.” William West Anderson was born on Sept. 19, 1928, in Walla Walla, Wash., the son of Otto West Anderson, a farmer, and the former Audrey Speer. He moved to Seattle after his parents divorced and his mother remarried. He graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla and briefly did graduate work at Stanford University. During his two years in the Army, he worked in radio and helped create military television stations. His television career really began when a friend suggested he move to Hawaii to work with him on “The Kini Popo Show,” a live daily variety show. The co-star was a chimpanzee. In Hawaii, he was cast in his first film, “Voodoo Island” (1957), a zombie-laden horror movie starring Boris Karloff; by 1959, he had been called to Hollywood for a screen test. Before “Batman” came along, Mr. West kept busy with guest roles on television series, including “Perry Mason,” “77 Sunset Strip” and just about every western on television, including “Maverick,” “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke.” He also appeared in close to a dozen feature films, among them “The Young Philadelphians” (1959), “Tammy and the Doctor” (1963) and “Robinson Crusoe on Mars” (1964).
arts,After “Batman” ended, Mr. West struggled to find meaningful acting jobs because he was so closely identified with his superhero role, but he continued to work in movies and TV, often playing roles that spoofed his Batman character. In later decades, he did a great deal of voice work, including a spectacularly long run (2000-17) on the animated series “Family Guy” as Mayor Adam West, a politician who might best be described as sadistic, corrupt, vacant, clueless and utterly charming. He appeared in a 2011 segment on the website Funny or Die called “Adam West Hits on You … Hard.” And last year he guest-starred on the sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” as himself, hired to appear at a private birthday party where things go wrong. (“I still get paid, don’t I?”) Mr. West married three times and divorced twice. In 1950, in his senior year of college, he married Billie Lou Yeager. They divorced six years later. He married Ngahra Frisbie in the mid-1950s, and their marriage lasted about a decade. In 1971, he married Marcelle Tagand Lear, who survives him, along with their two children, Nina and Perrin West. He is also survived by two children from his second marriage, Jonelle and Hunter Anderson; two stepchildren; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. The popularity of the “Batman” series was international, and fans had long memories. In 2005, Mr. West was interviewed for an article in The Independent of London.
arts,At 76, almost 40 years after the end of the TV show, Mr. West said: “What I loved about Batman was his total lack of awareness when it came to his interaction with the outside world. “He actually believed nobody would recognize him on the phone when he was Bruce Wayne, even though he made no attempt to disguise his voice.”
nyregion,Mayor’s Take on Policing Lacks Nuance - The New York Times Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, were in fine fettle on Monday, which is not to be confused with doing themselves any favors. Can you, a reporter asked at a news conference, persuade an appeals court to block a federal judge from imposing a legal monitor on your police force? The mayor offered a Dirty Harry squint. “Boy, I hope so,” he said, “because I wouldn’t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.” Mr. Kelly took on the judge’s charge that the department was racially profiling young men: “That simply is recklessly untrue,” he said. They are the aging Dead End twins, the billionaire mayor with his Hamptons-by-way-of-Bermuda tan and the square-jawed, crew-cut commissioner. Again and again, they displayed a fossil-like rigidity, refusing to concede even a jot of a point to the federal judge who imposed a monitor on the Police Department, or to the many critics who warned so often that a once-reasonable stop-and-frisk program had metastasized. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin’s ruling that the city’s stop-and-frisk program violates the constitutional rights of tens of thousands of black and Latino men came dipped in a bathtub of inevitability. She had signaled in every way possible during the trial that city officials held a losing legal hand. The mayor has a self-made man’s disdain for introspection and a wealthy man’s disdain for the word “no.” So on Monday, he preferred to grump about an unfair judge. “Throughout the case,” he complained, “we didn’t believe we were getting a fair trial.”
nyregion,Judge Scheindlin never talked, he complained, about how safe the city is. In fact, she made reference to this in the first line of her decision: “New Yorkers are rightly proud of their city and seek to make it as safe as the largest city in America can be.” But, she added, “New Yorkers also treasure their liberty.” Some in the mayor’s administration had argued that this case was a loser and that the administration should settle. The mayor waved them off, and in the end his theatrics could not disguise the bottom line: Once again, a judge had made chowder of a cherished policy. “He’s got a record-low murder and crime rate, and his Police Department has just had a federal monitor imposed on it,” said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. “How did he manage to pull that off?” The ruling did not turn on its head every police success. Legal stop-and-frisk tactics remain important, and officers are not, as some suggest, so many George Zimmermans. Nor is there a non-nauseating analogy to be drawn, as Anthony D. Weiner, the Howard Beale of mayoral candidates, tried, between Nazi Germany and officers on the beat. Rather, the city’s stop-and-frisk numbers might be seen as a visit from the ghosts of our long-ago dirty war. The late 1980s and early 1990s offered grim passage, with toddlers hit by stray bullets and mothers and even an elementary school principal slaughtered in the cross-fire of gangbangers.
nyregion,The response was not pretty. Police officers stopped young black and Latino men by the tens of thousands, and detectives and prosecutors too often treated legal standards of evidence and interrogation as optional. Michael Baum, a lawyer, defended David Ranta, who was convicted — unjustly — of killing a Brooklyn rabbi in the 1980s. After the verdict, Mr. Baum sat in a bar, disconsolate. A detective who had helped convict his client slid onto a stool next to him. “Don’t sweat this conviction,” he advised. “That skell of yours was guilty of something.” So the unjust was rationalized in service of safe streets. It is as if all of us — citizens, police officers, prosecutors, even judges — closed our eyes. What sets the use of mass stop-and-frisk tactics apart is that it continued into a new and safer era. Perhaps there’s a subtle conversation to be had about this. Just not on Monday at City Hall. The mayor chose to end the news conference by conjuring up an officer who comes upon a criminal with a drawn gun. The officer wants to pull his service revolver and defend himself. But he thinks: What about the federal monitor? What about the City Council-imposed inspector general? “By that time, he’s dead,” the mayor said, swelling with anger at his imaginary tale. “I’d like to see you go to the funeral and explain to the wife.” We had now floated a long way from the shores of stop-and-frisk tactics, into a mayoral reality all his own.
us/politics,Another Impasse on Gun Bills, Another Win for Hyperpolitics - The New York Times WASHINGTON — This week’s failed gun control votes in the Senate encapsulate much of what is wrong with and most frustrating about Congress. Not one senator in either party believes that someone who presents a serious terrorism risk should be able to waltz into a gun shop and legally buy powerful firearms. Yet partisanship, a reluctance to compromise and the influence of powerful special interests again prevented lawmakers from achieving a consensus, as four plans went down on Monday to entirely predictable defeats. It was just the latest instance in which lawmakers agreed that something needed to be done on an issue of national importance, but were unable to find a way to do it in Washington’s hyperpolitical atmosphere. The embarrassing result gave added momentum to bipartisan talks that produced on Tuesday an alternative expected to come to a vote as early as this week, providing lawmakers with another opportunity to act. But prospects for that plan, negotiated by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and a handful of Democrats, were uncertain. The legislative maneuvering in the aftermath of the Orlando terror attack has followed a familiar pattern. Democrats, holding new political leverage after the horrific killings of 49 people by a gunman in Orlando, Fla., were eager to press their advantage and were not about to make it easy for Republicans, pushing broader legislation on background checks, along with the central proposal that would have made it tougher for terrorism suspects to buy guns.
us/politics,“We are not going to be a cheap date on this one,” Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said in an interview last week. Most Republicans, with much on the line in this election year, were not willing to cross the National Rifle Association, which endorsed a Republican alternative that Democrats branded unworkable and a sham. Democrats say they cannot see themselves voting for any proposal blessed by the gun lobby. Republicans, as the majority party in the Senate, were not about to cede too much authority to Democrats and allow them to set the legislative agenda. Republicans were not amused by a 15-hour Democratic filibuster last week, a maneuver that essentially let the minority party take over the floor for the day. To top it all off, the two parties agreed to a filibuster-proof, 60-vote threshold on the gun control proposals, one that Democrats themselves could not meet when they controlled the Senate during the failure of a round of gun votes after the shooting in December 2012 in Newtown, Conn. It was a recipe for failure, leaving a sense of disappointment and anger among lawmakers and survivors of those lost in an epidemic of mass killings — another instance of dashed hopes that the latest unimaginable slaughter would be the one to finally provoke a compromise. “What am I going to tell 49 grieving families?” an emotional Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, asked after the votes. “I am going to tell them the N.R.A. won again.”
us/politics,The impasse has gotten to the point where it was seen as something of a victory — one that took concerted efforts by Democrats in last week’s filibuster — to merely force votes on what most agreed would have been a mainly symbolic step toward tighter gun laws. “We are at least going to get to see where people stand on some pretty simple concepts,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who led the filibuster and has been a determined advocate of new gun laws since the school shooting in Newtown. To Republicans, a central reason for the Democratic push was to gain campaign fodder against vulnerable Republicans, and to shift attention away from Democratic policy on fighting terrorism. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, accused Democrats of jumping on the Orlando tragedy as “an opportunity to push a partisan agenda or craft the next 30-second campaign ad.” The politics were palpable. Democrats believe that the gun issue could be employed effectively against Republican candidates in swing states like New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania that will decide control of the Senate in November. Minutes before the votes, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee issued a news release attacking Republican arguments against the legislation. Minutes after it failed, the organization issued statements harshly criticizing the votes of Republican contenders in Ohio and New Hampshire. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, one of the embattled Republicans, voted for both Democratic and Republican plans on terrorist screening, trying to avoid serious political trouble on the issue. Mr. Reid compared her position to doing yoga on the Senate floor.
us/politics,On Tuesday, Ms. Ayotte lent her support to the bipartisan compromise that would prevent those on the federal no-fly list, and on a second list for added airport screening, from buying guns, but would allow for an appeal. The federal government would be accountable for court costs for people who successfully contest the federal action. Both parties were weighing the legislation. To be successful, Ms. Collins and her allies will have to win the backing of Democrats and secure support from at least 14 and possibly more Republicans — a very tall order. Democrats noted that Ms. Collins herself often clashes with her party on gun control. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said about the legislative futility showcased in Monday’s tableaus. “That is what is so maddening about this.” It doesn’t have to be that way. But it always seems to be.
world/europe,Gary Lineker, Soccer Hero, Dips a Toe Into Post-Brexit British Politics - The New York Times LONDON — A group of child refugees had just landed in Britain and the country’s right-wing tabloids were in a fury, warning of foreigners cheating their way into the country by lying about their age. Amid the cacophony, a challenge arose on Twitter from an unexpected source. “The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. What’s happening to our country?” The tweet came not from a human rights advocate or from a liberal lawmaker but from Gary Lineker, one of the finest strikers in English soccer history and the veteran host of “Match of the Day,” a weekly roundup on the BBC of highlights from the Premier League that is the nation’s most popular sports show. It has turned Mr. Lineker, a onetime working-class boy from Leicester, into an unlikely spokesman for the much-maligned “liberal elite.” That amorphous catchall phrase has come to describe those in Britain who are uncomfortable with the anti-immigration and anti-European rhetoric that has become mainstream in Britain since last year’s vote to leave the European Union. Mr. Lineker has gone where not even the opposition Labour Party goes these days for fear of being branded out of touch.
world/europe,The Sun newspaper, incensed about being called racist for demanding dental X-rays to determine the age of the child refugees, ran a front-page article accusing Mr. Lineker of “peddling” a lie and demanded that the taxpayer-funded BBC fire him. His Twitter feed, followed by about 5.6 million and still mostly about soccer, has been inundated with vitriol and occasionally more polite demands that he “stick to football.” (“Stick to politics,” his fans retort on his behalf.) Mr. Lineker, who is not easily fazed — he claims not to have been nervous even when taking penalty kicks for England in the 1990 World Cup — shrugs off the furor. A twice-divorced father of four sons, he is no stranger to unwanted attention from the tabloids. If anything, he says, the latest criticism has made him more determined to speak his mind. “Being a sportsman I’m quite competitive, so I wasn’t just going to back down,” he said one recent afternoon in Barnes, the leafy West London neighborhood where he lives. Silver-haired and boyish-looking at 56, Mr. Lineker is something of a national treasure in Britain. With 48 international goals to his name, the former England captain scored more goals in World Cup finals than any other English player before or since. In the 1986 World Cup, he scored six times and won the Golden Boot for top scorer, the only English player to win the award.
world/europe,During his 16-year career, he was never given a yellow or red card and once was awarded a trophy for fair play by FIFA. So entrenched is his nice-guy image that advertisements for Walkers, a potato chip company based in Mr. Lineker’s hometown, Leicester, in central England, have played on it in commercials for years, featuring variations of a “Nasty Gary” who steals chips from children and never shares. Normally appearing on Match of the Day in sharp Italian suits, Mr. Lineker presented the show one week last September in underpants — making good on a promise a year earlier to strip if Leicester City won the Premier League. “The thing is, I knew categorically that there was zero chance of Leicester winning. Zero,” he said. Like the vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump’s election, he said, “it was just impossible.” If his first transformation was unusual — ex-soccer players sometimes become commentators and analysts, but few become anchors who write their own copy and dominate broadcasting as much as they once dominated the soccer pitch — Mr. Lineker’s outspoken forays into the minefield of post-Brexit politics are in some ways even more striking. A Europhile who learned Spanish so well while playing for Barcelona for three years that he says he used to dream in the language, Mr. Lineker urged Britain publicly to stay in the European Union before the referendum last June and condemned the vote after.
world/europe,“The E.U. has its weaknesses, but it’s been pretty good for us and it’s been pretty good for Europe and it’s kept peace,” he said. In November, he called Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of the main supporters of the withdrawal from Europe, a “racist” for describing President Obama as a “creature.” Lately, he has also taken on Mr. Trump. After Mr. Trump said last month that burning the American flag should be a crime punishable by a loss of citizenship, Mr. Lineker tweeted: “It’s soooo cold, I could burn a flag.” As for his tweet about refugees, that was “humanitarian” rather than political, he said. It was bold language for someone whose audience cuts across class, ethnicity, age and educational background and, if anything, is somewhat skewed to the working-class sector that lists immigration as its primary concern and that voted strongly to leave the European Union. Leicestershire, the central English county where Mr. Lineker grew up, backed the exit from Europe. For all he knows, his own father did. “I don’t like to ask because I’m too scared of the answer,” he said. Mr. Lineker, who is now worth an estimated $15 million, comes from solid working-class stock himself. The descendant of three generations of market-stall owners, he did not finish the equivalent of high school. (His final report card read: “Must devote less of his time to sport if he wants to be a success.”) Even after the local soccer club recruited him, he continued to help out at the family stall in the early years of his professional career.
world/europe,“People are fed up with the way things are,” he said. “There is a lot of bitterness out there, a lot of anger about a lack of jobs and concerns for the next generation.” “I understand all of that; I’ve grown up with that,” he said. “But all of a sudden we’re blaming all the ills of the country on refugees and foreigners. It’s just wrong.” Listening to Mr. Lineker, soccer becomes almost a parable for what has gone right and what has gone wrong in Britain over the last 30 years. When he played professionally in the 1980s, racism was unrestrained. He says he remembers bananas being thrown at black players. Abusive chants in the stadium were commonplace. Once, Mr. Lineker recalled, he got on a plane with John Barnes, a black player on his team, and an England supporter shouted: “You shouldn’t be allowed to wear an England shirt.” “We’ve come a million miles since then,” Mr. Lineker said. “But what you don’t want to see now is to turn back the other way.” For him the globalization of teams has done huge amounts to increase not just standards but also tolerance in the sport. “As footballers you just grow up with people from different backgrounds and different colors of skin,” he said. “When you sit in a dressing room and you’ve got 15 teammates with you, you don’t look around and think ‘He’s got black skin. He’s Asian.’ You think ‘He’s a great player. He’s a good player. He needs to work.’ ”
world/europe,If soccer has in some ways showcased growing tolerance in society, it has also mirrored the spectacular rise in income inequality that has developed in recent decades. Mr. Lineker’s grandfather played soccer in the army and received offers from a couple of soccer clubs but opted to work selling fruit and vegetables, which seemed a more economically stable option at the time. Mr. Lineker himself did well financially, but he was still in a generation of top-level players who needed to look for another job after retirement. Today’s superstars, like Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, earn in a week “what I earned in a year,” Mr. Lineker said. “There is a kind of parallel there” with what is happening in society at large, he said. The mention of those top players gets Mr. Lineker visibly excited. “We’re blessed to live in the era of both, to have two absolute greats at the same time,” he said. “Whereas Ronaldo is prolific, he’s an astonishing athlete, he is a wonderfully brilliant footballer, Messi brings joy. He’s beautiful to watch. He will always edge it for me.” In politics, he says, people lack that choice. “That’s the biggest problem at the moment,” he said. “I don’t think there is an opposition at the moment, not in this country.”
world/asia,Kunduz Residents Live in Fear of Taliban’s Return - The New York Times KUNDUZ, Afghanistan —  Farhad Azyanfar, a student of Dari literature at the university in Kunduz, watched in fear as a few hundred Taliban fighters overran and defeated a larger but demoralized government force to capture this northern city in September. He was relieved several weeks later when the insurgents left the city after a combined American and Afghan counterattack, but the feeling was short-lived: He and many other residents fear the Taliban will be back soon. “You can see the white flags of the Taliban along the road as soon as you step out of Kunduz City,” said Mr. Azyanfar, 20, who travels back to his district outside the provincial capital several times a week. The area controlled by the government extends “only to the buildings in which they are based,” he said. “As soon as you step outside, it is totally a different picture: The Taliban’s presence and influence are much larger than the government’s.” It has been more than four months since the Afghan forces crumbled as Taliban fighters overran Kunduz. But there has been no improvement in the conditions that made the two-week Taliban takeover of the city possible. Disillusionment with the government has only gotten worse; the Afghan forces are still overstretched and demoralized; and the Taliban still control much of the outlying areas and roads. Now, the worry in and around Kunduz is that it is inevitable that the insurgents will return, strengthened this time by weapons, ammunition and vehicles looted during their capture of the city.
world/asia,For a national government already strained by territory losses and infighting, another loss of a provincial capital — whether that is a repeat in Kunduz or a new setback in Helmand or another contested province — is an alarming prospect. The initial loss of Kunduz was a national trauma. Many Afghans began fleeing neighboring provincial capitals and district centers. An already huge wave of emigration accelerated after the assault. And, worrisomely in a country torn by warring strongmen in the ’90s, local warlords were threatening to remobilize and settle scores in the absence of a capable government defense. The repercussions of Kunduz’s fall were felt all the way to Washington, where President Obama abandoned his goal of ending America’s involvement in the Afghan war this year and instead extended the United States military mission beyond 2016. Around Kunduz, accounts by residents and officials make it clear that the city is still suffering under Taliban threat. Insurgent fighters regularly stage attacks on government checkpoints in the area and are sometimes bold enough to set up daytime roadblocks just a few miles outside the city center. Trade has slowed to a trickle. When the sun is up, the city center is crowded, but the streets empty as night falls, quiet except for the occasional sound of gunfire and rockets exploding on the outskirts of town. The buildings destroyed during the Taliban’s brief reign remain unrepaired amid uncertainty about the future, and the hospital run by Doctors without Borders, destroyed by an American airstrike, will not reopen until security is assured, the organization says.
world/asia,While the insurgents were forced to abandon the city center, they have maintained their hold on strategic districts, including Chardara and Dashti Archi, from which they launched their September attack. That fact bodes poorly for the spring, when the insurgents traditionally increase the tempo of fighting. Commander Nezam, who leads a militia in Kunduz, said that if government efforts to reinforce the city “don’t start now, Kunduz will fall permanently into the hands of the enemy and government forces will not be able to retake it.” He added: “The enemy is fully equipped and armed now. We are worried that operations haven’t started.” It was not lost on Kunduz residents that the city was freed only after direct help from American forces. The residents have demanded more support from the security forces, and new assurances that they will perform better. For its part, the Afghan National Army insists it is taking the initiative. “We are organizing the operation at the moment,” said Ghulam Hazrat, a spokesman for the Afghan Army’s 20th division in Kunduz. “Some small-scale military operations were initiated a few days ago, but had to be suspended because of poor weather.” Waseh Basel, spokesman for the Kunduz governor’s office, said the security situation was “satisfactory,” though “people are not as hopeful as they were before the city fell.” Still, he said: “Kunduz will not fall again because both the civil and military sectors are working together day and night. The military has carried out operations, and there will be more in the future.”
world/asia,President Ashraf Ghani responded to the September debacle by announcing a shake-up of the police, military and intelligence services, but analysts said that the changes had so far not gone far enough. Mr. Ghani also ordered local pro-government militias to join the government or disarm. In January, that led to at least one outbreak of violence when a militiaman shot and killed an Afghan soldier who was trying to disarm him. In the latest episode, the provincial governor’s secretary was killed on Tuesday under murky circumstances, and two local police officers were detained. Officials here say that over all, there has been little progress in either incorporating or disarming the militias, leaving a danger that the warlords will again challenge the authorities in Kabul if confidence in Mr. Ghani’s government frays further. “One of the problems in Kunduz is that you’ve got this Venn diagram of actors,” said Ted Callahan, a security adviser who has worked extensively in northern Afghanistan. “Their interests sometimes intersect and they may eventually cooperate against the Taliban.” But in the meantime, those warlords, whose loyalty to the government has been suspect at times, “are arming up,” he said, and there are concerns that another failure by the army to hold Kunduz could lead to a further loss of government authority in the region.
world/asia,As a sign of their confidence, the Taliban recently issued an edict that they said applied to all of Kunduz Province and was a direct throwback to their harsh rule in the late 1990s. The insurgents demanded that all women wear hijab, that men not shave. They also insisted on an end to the use of tobacco, drugs and alcohol, and a ban on “vulgar movies” and music. Insurgents even try to dictate which cellphone carriers people should use, Mr. Azyanfar, the literature student, said. The Taliban have warned Kunduz residents not to use service provided by companies that ignored its proclamation that cellphones not be used after sunset. Three times, Mr. Azyanfar said, he had seen people at insurgent roadblocks “forced to break down their MTN/Salam SIM cards and swallow them. People are scared to death.” Geeta Yaftali, formerly a project manager at the Empowerment Center for Women in Kunduz, quit her post and fled to Kabul after the city fell, as the militants systematically sought out women’s rights advocates for punishment. “The security situation in Kunduz is not promising,” she said, adding: “Anything can happen when you are advocating there, whether you are alone or surrounded by 10 men or women, you can still be targeted very easily.” Jan Mohammad, a shopkeeper in the central Chowk area of Kunduz City, felt the Taliban’s return was inevitable: “The Taliban are powerful and the government is not really paying much attention.”
world/asia,“If nothing changes, I believe by summer that we will once again see Taliban taking over Kunduz City,” he said. “If that happens, you have to be prepared to obey them.”
fashion,Ranked by Instagram: The Latest Men’s Wear Shows - The New York Times Not so long ago, the factors spelling success at fashion week for a label were threefold: who attended, what the critics said, and how the buyers responded. In the age of the smartphone, most brands strive to make their shows appealing to an additional 700 million — the number of average monthly users on Instagram, whose likes and mentions rain down on a label’s collections. “Designers understand these days that it’s a global ripple effect you can have,” said Eva Chen, Instagram’s head of fashion partnerships. “You can reach a 15-year-old boy who wants to invest in a new watch, even if he lives in Sydney or in Peru.” So as the latest round of men’s fashion weeks unfold this month across Europe, which labels have placed highest in Instagram rankings? In Milan, Dolce & Gabbana’s bid to tap into the millennial mind through hashtags and the inclusion of celebrity-spawn/models like Braison Cyrus (Miley’s brother, 444,000 followers) and Sistine Stallone (Sylvester’s daughter, 438,000 followers) paid off, and the label claimed the crown for the most likes and comments from June 16 to 20. To be fair, some of the comments were negative, after Raury, a musician walking in the show (162,000 followers), scrawled messages of protest on his chest after he learned of the designers’ support of Melania Trump. Miley Cyrus (68.9 million followers) also posted a criticism of the label’s politics on her Instagram account, prompting a rebuke from Stefano Gabbana (one million followers).
fashion,Emporio Armani came in second for interactions, a win most likely carried by the nearly 23 million followers of Shawn Mendes, the pop star who showed off the EA Connected smartwatch at the end of the runway show. His campaign photo for that product was the most-liked image posted on any designer account during Milan Fashion Week. Following the top two in Milan were Versace, whose collection alluded to the silk shirts and prints from the label’s ’90s men’s-wear heyday; Prada, where comic panels covered both the clothes and the walls; and Philipp Plein, whose show featured Jeremy Meeks, formerly known on the internet as “the hot felon” (1.1 million followers). “Philipp Plein is always a feast for the senses,” Ms. Chen said. “It’s true to his heritage. I would never say that’s the right path for every fashion brand.” At the Pitti Uomo men’s wear exhibition in Florence, Italy, the winner for most interactions was Off-White, the label run by Virgil Abloh (783,000 followers), whose collaborators have included Kanye West (no Instagram), Theophilus London (195,000 followers) and Moncler. Mr. Abloh worked with the artist Jenny Holzer (no Instagram) to project poems written by refugees onto the facade of the Palazzo Pitti, as models walked in his new collection. The setup seemed tailored for Instagram, where an image from the show garnered the most likes of all the Pitti Uomo designers accounts during the four-day event.
fashion,Off-White was followed by J.W. Anderson, whose designer, Jonathan Anderson, has 184,000 followers of his own, and Hugo Boss, which showed a Basquiat-inspired collection in the narrow courtyard of a Fascist Party-era tobacco factory. Four of the top five names for interactions in London were relative newcomers or unknowns, a result of large brands like Burberry no longer putting on runway shows during London Fashion Week Men’s. “London is a market for emerging designers,” Ms. Chen said. “It rewards the experimental. People on Instagram expect that from London.” The designers that had the most interactions, in order from second to fifth: A-Cold-Wall, where Samuel Ross, Mr. Abloh’s former assistant (31,000 followers), riffed on blue-collar uniforms; Topman, whose presentation included an exhibition, a film and an installation; Kiko Kostadinov, where the theme was “murderous transgression”; and Charles Jeffrey, where performers dressed in costumes made of cardboard boxes, and models wore clown makeup. And though Kent & Curwen did not crack the top five, it did take the top spot for most followers gained during London Fashion Week Men’s, a boost most likely driven by David Beckham (38.1 million followers), one of the label’s owners, whose preview post of the collection garnered 942,000 views. But the overall winner for London, for the number of interactions and the most popular designer photo, was no small fry at all. It was Dame Vivienne Westwood, who filled her runway with rappers, dancers, contortionists and clowns, and stuck garbage to her models to make a point about climate change and recycling.
fashion,Her Instagram popularity showed that even on the app, a space where the new and unknown can thrive, a tried-and-true formula still applies: Combine spectacle with brand history and you have a marketing success.
us/politics,Huma Abedin Says Clinton’s Email Server Caused Frustration - The New York Times Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide and confidante, acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state created frustration at times because of computer glitches but said she did not raise concerns about the unusual arrangement, according to a transcript of a deposition made public on Wednesday. Ms. Abedin, who served as Mrs. Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department and is now the vice chairwoman of her presidential campaign, said her boss’s use of the private server was never intended to sidestep federal record-keeping laws. Mrs. Clinton, she said, wanted to protect her personal information “just like anybody who has personal email would want to keep their personal email private.” The exchange focused on a 2010 email first disclosed by the State Department’s inspector general in a scathing report last month, in which Mrs. Clinton raised concerns about accepting a new BlackBerry because she did not want “any risk of the personal being accessible.” Mrs. Clinton has previously said that using a single, private email address on a private server was simply a matter of convenience. Ms. Abedin is the seventh of eight aides and department officials who have now given sworn testimony in a legal proceeding brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog organization. The organization’s case began with an inquiry into Ms. Abedin’s special employment status at the end of Mrs. Clinton’s tenure at the State Department. The group’s initial request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act turned up little, but the matter was reopened last year after Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email for official State Department business became known.
us/politics,The depositions have drawn attention to Mrs. Clinton’s use of the server at a time the F.B.I. is completing its investigation into the emails and Mrs. Clinton has tried to keep the focus on her  election campaign against Donald J. Trump. Patrick F. Kennedy, a career foreign service officer who is an under secretary of state for management and operations, testified in the same proceedings on Wednesday. His testimony is expected to be released on Thursday. Ms. Abedin’s testimony, which lasted five hours, provided few new details about Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private server. She decided to use it when she began the move from the Senate to the State Department after President Obama nominated her to be secretary of state, a position she held from January 2009 to February 2013. Ms. Abedin herself had an address on the private server, which aides to Bill Clinton maintained at the couple’s home in suburban New York, as well as an official address with the State Department’s system at state.gov. While she testified that she did most of her email work on the official account, she said that she and Mrs. Clinton used the private server for some government business, as well, especially while traveling abroad. Ms. Abedin said repeatedly that she gave no thought during her time at the State Department as to how the use of the private email server might affect requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act. She said she did not remember the preservation of records ever being discussed with Mrs. Clinton or with other State Department officials, even after public requests came in.
us/politics,She said that because most of those emails were State Department-related issues forwarded from her government account, she assumed there was already a record of the exchange in the government account. “Honestly, I wish I thought about it at the time,” she said. “As I said, I wasn’t perfect. I tried to do all of my work on state.gov. And I do believe I did the majority of my work on state.gov.” Quizzed about the concerns Mrs. Clinton expressed in 2010 about her personal emails being made public, Ms. Abedin explained that at the time she and others in the department were trying to figure out why Mrs. Clinton had not received an email about a telephone call with Bernard Kouchner, who was then the foreign minister of France. Ms. Abedin suggested to Mrs. Clinton that she should have a separate BlackBerry for work or post her personal address so that others in the department beyond her inner circle would know how to reach her in the future. In the end, both alternatives were rejected. That exchange with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Abedin said, was an occasion when the email arrangement disrupted official business, one of several glitches described in the depositions or the inspector general’s report. “Just reading the exchange, she seems frustrated because she’s not able to do her job,” Ms. Abedin said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. “I seem frustrated back because I’m not.”
us/politics,Ms. Abedin said repeatedly that she could not recall specific details about Mrs. Clinton’s email practices and said she was unaware of most of the technical matters involved. She also acknowledged that she refused to speak with the inspector general for its investigation – “on the advice of my attorneys.” Ms. Abedin, like Mrs. Clinton and others, said she assumed that the use of a private email was allowed, even though the inspector general’s report concluded that no permission was ever sought and it would have been turned down if it had. Asked why neither she nor other aides to Mrs. Clinton mentioned the private server to State Department officials in charge of preserving documents, she described it as an oversight. “It is not anything that occurred to us,” she said. “We all wish we could go back and that not be the case.”
nyregion,The Neediest Cases; A Young Woman With Limited Vision Works, and Builds Self-Esteem - The New York Times It is impossible to describe exactly what Nicole Klimuk sees through her light brown eyes. It is easier to describe how her near-blindness affects the way she moves. Her eyes meander aimlessly while she is engaged in a conversation, but they become intently focused when she lowers her head to read from a notebook. At just a fraction of an inch away from the pages she reads, Ms. Klimuk's nose practically scrapes the large-print text they contain as she searches for a friend's address. ''To her, this is her world,'' said her mother, Martha, 45. ''This is the way she sees it.'' Legally blind but able to see to a limited extent, Nicole Klimuk is living with the results of retinal deterioration that occurred when she was an infant -- a symptom of an inherited disease called methylmalonic aciduria, so rare that when doctors diagnosed it, they told her mother there were only seven other known cases in the United States. They also said that of those seven cases, Nicole's had reached the most advanced stages of severity. Until she began receiving treatment as a baby, she did not seem to have control of her muscles. She did not begin to speak or to walk until she was 5.
nyregion,Ms. Klimuk, who lives with her parents and sister, Danielle, 23, in the Heartland Village neighborhood in Staten Island, takes an injection of a potent form of vitamin B12 and a folic acid pill every morning, and an extra-powerful vitamin at night. ''It's almost like the body needs to be tuned up with these medications,'' Mrs. Klimuk said. ''She needs an abundance to keep her chemical balance.'' Ms. Klimuk, 19, is a special education student at Susan Wagner High School in Staten Island. She is preparing to graduate in June and is already concerned about finding a job. Last summer she answered phones at the high school's switchboard, but found she did not enjoy the job as much as one she has had for four summers as a counselor-in-training at the Father John C. Drumgoole Summer Day Camp in Staten Island, which is run by the Catholic Youth Organization. ''I guess I like working with children more than answering the phones,'' she said. The day camp is a beneficiary of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which provides money for the counselor-in-training program at the camp. At the camp, Ms. Klimuk helps the campers, who range in age from 4 to 7, get breakfast and lunch, takes them on nature hikes and to the swimming pool, and coaches them in volleyball, basketball and soccer.
nyregion,''Everyone really enjoyed her company,'' said Jessica King, 21, a camp counselor who worked closely with Ms. Klimuk for four years. Ms. King said the younger campers did not pay much attention to the fact that Ms. Klimuk has a disability. ''The older kids would notice it, and she would explain to them that she's blind. They weren't making fun of her; they were interacting in a way that showed they were learning and understanding.'' Ms. Klimuk started working at the camp, in the Tottenville neighborhood, after she mentioned to a teacher, Carol Kasparian, that she was bored during the summer. Ms. Kasparian called her friend, Fran Mitilieri, at the time the director of the camp. Ms. Mitilieri visited Nicole at school and decided to hire her as a counselor-in-training. ''My philosophy is that everyone can make a contribution,'' Ms. Mitilieri said. Ms. Klimuk's mother said that people at the camp had given her daughter ''self-esteem and that sense of feeling good about herself that not many people have afforded her in the past.'' ''They didn't look so much on her disability, they focused on what she is able to do,'' Mrs. Klimuk said. Ms. Klimuk said she is not really upset about being visually impaired. ''I'm really used to it by now,'' she said, but noted that she wished she could drive a car and go to college. She said she would probably move out of her parents' house by the time she turned 25.
nyregion,Now that Ms. Klimuk has learned about working with children, she wants to make a career out of it by working at a preschool. Her mother said it was proving difficult to find a job, partly because she is not graduating with a traditional high school diploma, but with one from an individualized education plan, which will signify that she has accomplished the goals she and her teachers set for her. Despite the seeming difficulties, Ms. Klimuk's parents are confident that their daughter will make the most of herself. ''I know whatever she does, she's going to do a good job,'' said her father, Joe, 48, a city bus driver. ''She's that type of kid.''

world/asia,Philippine Government and Communist Rebels Extend Cease-Fire - The New York Times MANILA — The Philippine government and Communist rebels agreed on Friday to extend a mutual cease-fire and return to the negotiating table in October as they wrapped up their first round of peace talks after a five-year impasse. A joint statement issued after five days of talks in Oslo said the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People’s Army, had agreed to “declare and issue an indefinite unilateral cease-fire,” extending a truce that had been scheduled to end on Saturday. Both sides agreed to return to negotiations Oct. 8 to 12 in Oslo. The Philippines’ presidential peace adviser, Jesus Dureza, said that President Rodrigo Duterte should share credit for the accord. He said the talks were “a milestone” in more than 40 years of a rebellion that has left vast areas of the countryside mired in poverty and at least 35,000 soldiers, rebels and civilians dead. “Not only has President Duterte walked the extra mile, he has also taken the step back to give the N.D.F. space under his democratic and inclusive government,” Mr. Dureza said in a statement, using the initials of the Communists’ political wing, the National Democratic Front. “We will go home with a promise of a just and lasting peace and our soldiers and the combatants of the N.D.F. finally coming to terms that the war must end,” he said.
world/asia,The Communist Party began its rebellion in 1968, but its armed wing has diminished drastically because of government successes on the battlefield. The movement drew its base from Filipinos angered by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos’s ironhanded rule, and the Philippine Army estimated that the rebel forces at their height numbered 25,000. But after the collapse of Communism worldwide and the overthrow of Mr. Marcos in 1986, rebel fighters are now estimated to number just 4,000. Mr. Duterte has made peace overtures to the exiled Communist Party founder, Jose Maria Sison, 77, who was once his university professor. The president has also dangled the possibility of rebel participation in a coalition government and has named some well-known leftists to his cabinet. In addition, he has released more than 20 rebels from prison to act as “consultants” to the talks, in a gesture that had often been rejected by previous governments. On Friday, both sides agreed to the “reconstitution” of an earlier agreement ensuring guarantees of safety and immunity for rebel leaders as well as the continued “releases of political prisoners.” “I am sure that the Filipino people appreciate the work of the two negotiating panels and that they are elated by the results of the formal talks,” Mr. Sison said in a statement. “These advance their struggle for national and social liberation and for a just and lasting peace.” Luis Jalandoni, the Communists’ chief peace negotiator, said he expected more rebel prisoners to be freed soon.
world/asia,He said the talks in October were expected to address “social, economic and political reforms.” Negotiations between the two sides fell apart in 2001 when the rebels backed out after the United States government designated them a foreign terrorist organization, making it difficult for their movement to obtain overseas funding. Peace efforts resumed in 2011, but they have often broken down, with each side accusing the other of insincerity and of carrying out attacks.
world/middleeast,Yemen’s War Becomes the Mother of Reinvention - The New York Times SANA, Yemen — To blare the jingle that draws the children to his ice cream cart — in the midst of a war — Noah Taha has been forced to improvise. There is rarely electricity here in Sana. Not for hospitals, not for homes, and not to charge Mr. Taha’s little blue MP3 player. To solve his problem, Mr. Taha put a solar panel on the front of his cart so he could play the jingle — a somewhat haunting tune he called the Na Na song, after an ice cream brand — as he peddled through the Yemeni capital. It was clever, but Mr. Taha said he had seen better. “I saw solar used on an electric wheelchair,” he said. “That was the best idea.” I met Mr. Taha on a street full of electrical shops during a recent visit to Yemen, my third since the signs of conflict began to emerge early in 2015. With each visit, people seem more put-upon: running lower on money, more desperate to find work, and struggling to find food, medical care or a safe place to live. But Yemenis are also famously resilient, living in the poorest country in the region and saddled for decades with feckless leaders. To cope with the war, many have seamlessly adapted to new roles. Pediatricians have doubled as trauma surgeons, businesspeople have transformed into aid workers, and proprietors of electrical supply shops have become experts on solar power.
world/middleeast,“We didn’t know anything,” said Khairullah Ali al-Omeisy, 24, who owns an electrical supply shop but learned all he could about solar panels when the boom began several months ago. “We tried to know everything.” After scouring the Internet, he can now tell customers about the difference between Chinese and Canadian solar panels or the life span of Vietnamese gel batteries. Solar panels are all over Sana these days, even available on installment plans for those who cannot afford them outright. “We made a huge profit,” Mr. Omeisy said. Every shop on Shaoob Street was getting in on the action — and even people without a traditional shop. Mohammed al-Fendi, who until recently was a carpenter, now sells the solar kits out of an old minibus he converted into a store. “The market is wide open,” he said. And he thinks it will stay that way for a while: Even if the war ended, he doubted the ability of any new government to restore power for more than three or four hours a day. Closer to Yemen’s front lines, people have made more jarring transformations. Ahmed Naji Abdu once worked as a driver at the Taj Sheba, one of Sana’s fanciest hotels. Now he works for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders as a driver in Taiz, a city torn apart by some of the fiercest fighting in Yemen’s civil war.
world/middleeast,Mr. Abdu’s work, for one of the few international organizations operating in the city, was harrowing enough. But his home was also in shooting distance of battles in Taiz, and his family was forced to abandon the upper floors of the house after errant bullets struck it. The clashes have become more frequent in his neighborhood. “At night, it doesn’t stop,” he said. His colleague, Dr. Arwa Ahmed Saeed, was an obstetrician in Taiz when the war broke out. She worked for a time at hospitals in the crossfire, where the victims were “fighters, women and children,” she said. One day, seven women in one family, ages 11 to 21, were killed when a rocket hit their home. On another occasion, one of the victims was a three-day-old infant, she said. She spoke to me in a much quieter emergency room a few miles from the fighting, in a mother-and-child hospital run by Doctors Without Borders. The work seemed no less urgent as she shuttled around the ward, treating children with respiratory problems. Yet she admitted that she sometimes longed to be back at one of the front-line emergency rooms, despite all the misery she had seen. “I feel like I offered help,” she said. Less than a mile from the hospital where Ms. Saeed now works, a trash-filled sand lot offered a reminder of the dangers medical workers have faced throughout the war.
world/middleeast,An airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition in December landed in the lot near a tented mobile clinic set up by Doctors Without Borders to help displaced people. It killed an 18-year-old man, Yahya Mohamed Dahan, when a piece of shrapnel pierced his chest, his relatives said. The lot was still full of tents, transformed into something resembling a neighborhood. As I visited, an ice cream vendor peddled by, playing the same haunting jingle. On my flight out of Sana, I saw another doctor trying to deliver care in terrible conditions. He was accompanying a mother, a father and their sick infant son, Muhammad, who was breathing with the aid of a manual ventilator. They had set up a makeshift intensive care unit in a row of seats across the aisle from me, on an aging Airbus operated by Yemenia that is one of the few links between the capital and the outside world. One machine, the size of a briefcase, sat on the tray table in front of the boy’s mother, and another, a monitor of some kind with flashing red lights, sat in his bassinet, never leaving the doctor’s gaze. The doctor sat next to the father, and they took turns gently squeezing the airbag. It was not clear what ailed the boy, and no one wanted to interrupt the doctor to ask. The father’s frantic calls to Jordan, the plane’s destination, requesting that an ambulance meet them on the tarmac, suggested the boy’s condition was grave. The journey, which once took a few hours, now takes six hours or more.
world/middleeast,Planes to and from Sana now stop for a two-hour security check in Saudi Arabia. The inconvenience of the stopover has infuriated Yemeni travelers, who see the security measures as an unnecessary and almost colonial imposition by the Saudis. As Muhammad fought for breath, the delay was potentially fatal. The doctor appealed to a Saudi security agent who was on the plane checking passports to hurry things along. “Brother, we are doing everything we can,” the agent replied. But the plane remained parked for an unbearable 45 minutes. The mother moved her thumb up and down her fingers, in a rhythm meant to simulate prayer beads. Passengers in nearby rows uttered their own prayers for the infant. The plane finally left Saudi Arabia, and the cabin lights were dimmed. Members of the airline staff gathered around the family, and the improvised infirmary, shining flashlights on the baby so the doctor could see. The plane arrived in Jordan. The ambulance was waiting.
world/americas,Behind 2016’s Turmoil, a Crisis of White Identity - The New York Times
business,Macy’s Courts Muslims With New Hijab Brand - The New York Times Macy’s will introduce a collection of modest clothing, including hijabs, next week, making it the latest company to try to capture a piece of the lucrative Muslim clothing market. The retailer’s Verona Collection, the brainchild of the fashion photographer Lisa Vogl, will debut in stores and online on Feb. 15, with international shipping available. The collection consists of maxi dresses, long tops, hand-dyed hijabs, cardigans and pants — garments that are priced from $12.95 to $84.95. In a news release, Cassandra Jones, senior vice president of Macy’s Fashion, called the items “everyday essentials designed for versatility and comfort.” After converting to Islam in 2011, Ms. Vogl had difficulty finding modest, fashionable clothing, she said on the Verona Collection website, which led her to create the brand. Last year, she joined Macy’s’ development program, The Workshop, which helps nurture businesses owned by minorities and women. Through the Workshop, it became clear to Macy’s that Ms. Vogl’s brand was “a perfect example of a strong business that provides a unique product that serves a community of women looking for fashionable modest clothing options,” the company said on Thursday. Macy’s also said that customer interest was evident during a pop-up showcase of Workshop vendors last year in Manhattan. Ms. Vogl did not respond to a request for comment.
business,Macy’s has for years struggled with lagging sales, aggravated by the rise of online discount retailers. In November, the department store chain announced that sales had slipped for the 11th consecutive quarter. In 2016, it announced plans to shutter about 100 stores, and closings have been carried out since. The move into Muslim apparel represents an opportunity to capitalize on a robust market. Globally, consumers spent $254 billion in 2016 on Muslim attire, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report. The report predicted the market could be worth $373 billion by 2022. In 2015, Muslim women spent $44 billion on modest clothing items alone, an earlier Global Islamic Economy report said. “The clothing may be modest, the success is anything but,” it stated. Luxury retailers, including Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry, have taken notice, as have companies that specialize in trendy casual wear, like Uniqlo, H&M and Zara. Some of these retailers have released collections aimed at Muslim customers who live in the Middle East, but Islamic fashion has also cropped up in the United States in recent years. In 2016, during New York Fashion Week, an Indonesian designer made history with a catwalk show in which every model wore a hijab. “I believe fashion is one of the outlets in which we can start that cultural shift in today’s society to normalize the hijab in America and other parts of the West, so as to break down stereotypes and demystify misconceptions,” the designer, Anniesa Hasibuan, said at the time.
business,Of two billion Muslims worldwide, about nine million are in North America, according to a 2014 study released by the American Muslim Consumer Consortium. The consortium’s founder put Muslim spending power in the United States at about $100 billion. Last year, Nike released a Pro Hijab for Muslim athletes, which is also available on Macy’s’ website, and American Eagle offered customers a limited-edition denim hijab, which sold out. The hijab has also been recognized by one of America’s largest toy retailers. In November, Mattel introduced a hijab-wearing Barbie, part of its “Shero” line based on inspirational women. The doll was modeled after the Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first American athlete to compete in the Olympics in a hijab. But as more companies in the United States have embraced the hijab, women in Iran have been throwing off their head scarves, protesting religious restrictions — in particular a compulsory rule to cover their hair with an Islamic veil. At least 29 people have been arrested in connection with the protests. A news report said the Tehran Police were “deceived by the propaganda of a campaign named White Wednesdays” that called for women to remove their veils and wave them overhead on sticks. Muslim head scarves, veils and burqas have also been a flash point in France for over a decade. Women were barred from wearing full-face veils in public places in 2011, and last year the European Union’s highest court said that companies could bar employees from wearing visible religious symbols, including head scarves. In 2016, several French beach towns banned the so-called burkini — a full-body bathing suit worn by some Muslim women.
business,Some younger people, though, including in the United States, seem to be gaining an appreciation and an understanding of the hijab. Hijab fashion bloggers on Instagram, for example, are abundant and some have millions of followers. And the website Buzzfeed, whose audience skews younger, consistently publishes content about hijab fashion. According to the Global Islamic Economy report, Muslim millennials are considered a powerful and growing economic force that will continue to transform the retail space with digital spending. Half of Muslims today are under 15 years old and nearly two-thirds are 30 or younger.
realestate,Shopping for Console Tables - The New York Times Console tables are frequently among the last pieces of furniture to be added to a room. “They sometimes get neglected,” said Tara Bernerd, an interior designer in London. “Very often, it’s on that second look, after a room is filled,” she added, that the need for one becomes apparent — because they serve a variety of purposes. “In an entrance, they’re useful for keys and objects you always need on your way in or out,” said Ms. Bernerd, whose book, “Tara Bernerd: Place,” is being published by Rizzoli next month. “In the living room, it’s a punctuation mark,” she continued, noting that a sculptural console can be “almost like a piece of art.” And against the back of a sofa, a console can be used to display any number of things, like “a stunning Murano vase or a pile of marvelous books,” Ms. Bernerd said. “It’s also a chic, effortless way to have a tray with decanters, if you’re someone who doesn’t want a full bar in your living room.” • How deep should the top be? “You need to be very aware of scale,” Ms. Bernerd said, as proportions will vary on consoles, and larger ones may overwhelm a narrow space. • Do you want it to stand out? “There are so many different finishes available that a console can be magnificent in its own right,” she said. “Or it can nearly disappear, if it’s acrylic or glass.”

sports,How Good Is That Women’s Player? Look a Little Deeper - The New York Times Soon after Alex Varlan was hired as the video coordinator for the University of Tennessee women’s basketball team last summer, he called Aaron Barzilai, a friend and former colleague with the Philadelphia 76ers. For the previous three years, when Varlan was on the men’s staff at Oakland University, the team had used numerous advanced statistics resources, including the popular KenPom.com website run by the independent analyst Ken Pomeroy. But when Varlan began looking for similar statistical applications for the women’s game, he was disappointed at the paucity of options. He thought Barzilai, who has provided statistical analyses for N.B.A. front offices for a decade, could help bring the same insights to help women’s teams. After multiple discussions with Varlan, Barzilai relented. And in December, he started HerHoopStats.com, a subscription website devoted to N.C.A.A. Division I women’s basketball. “My thought was that it was probably something between a business idea and a public service,” Barzilai said. “I wasn’t really sure how big the market would be, and I think that still remains to be seen.” Men’s sports have been committed consumers of analytics for years, particularly Major League Baseball and the N.B.A. Every franchise now employs people to make sense of the numbers it collects, or to blend them into new, more involved, more specific measurements. At the same time, fans increasingly have warmed to analytics as nuanced measurements of the value of a player or the strength of a team.
sports,Women’s sports leagues, however, have rarely had their own advanced analytics. The W.N.B.A. introduced statistics like effective field-goal percentage, defensive rating and true shooting percentage on its website two years ago, and while the National Women’s Soccer League has discussed the idea of making advanced statistics available, its website currently offers basic categories like goals, assists, shots and saves. While many of the newer basketball metrics remain mysterious to casual fans, to a studied one, statistics like effective field-goal percentage — which gives more value to 3-pointers than 2-pointers — can offer valuable insight. The same is true for points per 100 possessions (which adjusts for variations in teams’ pace of play) and usage rate (which estimates the percentage of plays a player is involved in while on the court). And in their granular details, advanced stats can make a good player look even better. Take the Missouri junior Sophie Cunningham. She is a fairly well-known player, a two-time all-Southeastern Conference guard averaging more than 18 points a game. That figure ranks her in the top 80 nationally, but what advanced stats reveal is that Cunningham is actually one of the best scorers in the country because of her efficiency. She is averaging 1.36 points each time she tries to shoot, including when she is fouled and sent to the line. That ranks sixth in the country, out of more than 3,100 qualifying players, even though her field-goal percentage ranks only 127th.
sports,Kara Lawson, a former University of Tennessee and W.N.B.A. guard who is in her first year as a television analyst for the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards, believes that traditional statistics like scoring and rebounding averages seem to carry more weight in perceiving the value of players in the women’s game than in the men’s. “A large part of that is because of the analytics,” she said. “If there’s nothing to look at beyond the traditional box score, then people just tend to go off of reputation or the traditional box score, which isn’t representative of what’s helping to win basketball games.” When Varlan, the Tennessee assistant, worked on the Oakland men’s staff during the 2015-16 season, for example, the coaches noticed an advanced statistic that showed the team was one of the nation’s worst Division I teams in defending pick-and-roll plays. So Coach Greg Kampe and the other assistants watched film and came up with adjustments in how they defended such situations; by last season, Oakland had become one of the nation’s best teams in that category, and ended up winning the Horizon League regular-season title. “The analytics are very important,” Varlan said. “It starts conversations is what it really does. But you need to have a coaching mind looking at them to figure out what’s important and what isn’t important.” A former basketball player at M.I.T., Barzilai said he began to follow the growth of advanced analytics while doing graduate work in mechanical engineering at Stanford. A few years later, he created his own website, Basketball Value, while working as a management consultant in Princeton, N.J.
sports,That website’s examination of adjusted plus-minus data caught the attention of N.B.A. front offices and led to paid consulting jobs with the 76ers and the Memphis Grizzlies over the next few years. In 2012, the 76ers hired him as their director of basketball analytics, a role he held for the next three years. Since leaving the 76ers, he has done work for other N.B.A. franchises on a freelance basis. Now he is juggling those assignments with Her Hoop Stats, a concept that grew on him as he and Varlan began their discussions last summer. Barzilai acknowledged it would take time for his site to match the reach of other subscription services in other sports. Her Hoop Stats applies advanced mathematical formulas to basic statistics to better understand the numbers, but it doesn’t use video, so it couldn’t tell you which women’s team is bad at defending pick-and-roll plays, for example. He would not disclose how many people have paid the $20 annual fee to gain access to the full range of information on the site, but he said coaches and broadcasters had thanked him merely for creating it. He said he planned to expand it to include W.N.B.A. data this year, and possibly Division II and III women’s programs in the coming years — if there is an appetite for the information. “I’m hoping this will contribute to better understanding the women’s game and then that will help grow the game a little bit,” he said. “If it can be something more, that would be awesome.”
world/europe,En France, le déclin des villes de province est celui d’un marqueur de son identité - The New York Times ALBI, France — La peinture est défraîchie, mais le mot est encore lisible : ALIMENTATION. On dirait un décor de théâtre pendu au-dessus de la vitrine de ce vieil établissement vacant. En face, un salon de tatouage. Personne n’y entre ni en sort. La rue est déserte. Continuez votre chemin et vous découvrirez d’autres devantures closes, çà et là dans le centre historique de cette ville dominée par l’imposante cathédrale en briques du XIIIe siècle, l’un des joyaux de France. Les boutiques pour touristes et les grandes chaînes de l’habillement sont ouvertes, mais les épiceries, les cafés et les boucheries, tous ces établissements qui au cours des siècles animaient le cœur des villes comme celle-ci, ont disparu. Dans un pays comme la France, qui foisonne de beauté et dont les traditions semblent immuables, il n’est pas aisé de prendre la mesure des changements, voire de la décomposition en cours. Elle saute pourtant aux yeux, à Albi comme dans des centaines d’autres communes. La France perd, une à une, ses villes de province de taille moyenne — ces pôles de vie denses et raffinés, profondément ancrés dans le milieu rural, où les juges rendaient justice, où Balzac situait ses romans, où les préfets émettaient des ordres et où les citoyens pouvaient acheter une cinquantaine de fromages différents.
world/europe,Je me suis rendu à Albi en janvier à l’occasion d’un reportage sur la campagne présidentielle française. Je connais la ville depuis presque 35 ans, pour y être passé à plusieurs reprises après l’installation de mes parents à Paris lorsque j’avais 4 ans. Ma première visite remonte à 1982, j’y étais en compagnie de ma petite amie à l’université. J’y ai trouvé une ville extraordinairement animée, un bijou ocre-rouge, de la couleur des briques dont sont construites ses maisons depuis le Moyen-Âge et que rehausse le brûlant soleil méridional. J’avais été envoûté. En janvier, ce n’était pas d’un candidat à la présidence que je suivais la trace mais d’un paradoxe sous-tendant la campagne électorale, à savoir que les Français sont à la fois profondément fiers de leur mode de vie, qu’ils considèrent incomparable, et rongés par l’angoisse de le voir disparaître. Cette campagne est presque sans équivalent en France car elle est dominée par la question centrale de l’inconcevable, mais possible victoire de la candidate d’extrême-droite Marine Le Pen. Déjà le discours s’est droitisé, et la candidate a fait une promesse quasi-viscérale aux électeurs, celle de préserver la France et l’identité française. Que la menace soit définie comme l’islam, l’immigration ou la mondialisation, son engagement est le même : elle se présente comme celle qui préservera la vie à la française.
world/europe,L’anxiété latente se nourrit en partie du déclin visible d’innombrables centres-villes historiques. Voir se déliter ainsi les anciennes villes de province est un coup de plus porté à l’identité française — la preuve tangible qu’un mode de vie disparaît. Le même processus a touché les centres-villes américains, peu à peu vidés de leur substance au cours des décennies passées. D’après un sondage récent, 10,4 % des commerces des villes moyennes de France sont désormais fermés, plus du double du chiffre d’il y a 15 ans. Le déclin de ces communes s’est accompagné d’une droitisation politique du vote local. Bien qu’Albi soit traditionnellement centriste, la ville souffre d’un déclin similaire et partage les mêmes angoisses politiques. Au détour d’une rue, voici la dernière école de la vieille ville — fermée depuis quelques années. Dans une artère voisine, le dernier magasin de jouets, fermé lui aussi, puis la dernière petite épicerie indépendante, ses volets également clos. Le soir, seul le son de vos pas sur le pavé vient troubler l’épais silence des rues désertes. Dans une tribune récente du Figaro, l’homme d’affaire Charles Beigbeder écrivit : “À terme, si rien n’est entrepris, c’est une part éminente de l’âme française qui périra, emportant dans son flot plus de la moitié de la population française.”  Il plaidait pour un “plan Marshall” pour “la France périphérique.”
world/europe,Albi, 49,000 âmes. J’y suis arrivé un jeudi soir, en voiture depuis Toulouse, à une heure de route. De la fenêtre je voyais un gigantesque centre commercial, Les Portes d’Albi, dont le parking était bondé. Dans l’Albi que j’avais connu auparavant, les commerçants logeaient en ville, au-dessus de leurs boutiques. Des siècles d’histoire et de vie peuplaient les boulevards ombragés. Faire ses courses était un geste social autant qu’économique. En préparant mon voyage, j’étais tombé sur un rapport du gouvernement qui s’est révélé être une sorte d’autopsie des villes de province — Agen, Limoges, Bourges, Arras, Béziers, Auxerre, Vichy, Calais, et autres. Dans ces villes ancestrales, certaines plus durement touchées qu’Albi, l’interaction entre une architecture à taille humaine faite de pierre et de brique et la vie publique avait été le creuset séculaire de l’histoire et de la culture françaises. Désormais, elles s’éteignaient, pouvait-on lire dans ce rapport au vocabulaire sec et concis, car une partie constitutive du mode de vie français se délitait progressivement. Le rapport qualifiait de “préoccupant” le “phénomène de dévitalisation des centralités urbaines” car “le commerce participe à la vie de la cité et la façonne en grande partie.” Mon premier rendez-vous était avec le lanceur d’alerte de la ville qui avait accepté de me servir de guide. Ce n’était pas une quelconque affaire de corruption que Florian Jourdain dénonçait, mais un phénomène exposé aux yeux de tous, à savoir le déclin de la ville. Son blog, tenu méticuleusement, avait attiré l’attention de la presse française et déclenché une telle rancœur parmi l’établissement commercial d’Albi qu’une manifestation s’était tenue sur la place principale à l’initiative d’une association de commerçants.
world/europe,Diplômé d’histoire, ayant suivi des cours de géographie, M. Jourdain avait mis sur son blog une carte d’Albi où chaque commerce fermé était indiqué par une tête de mort. Il avait découvert que près de 40 % des établissements restants vendaient des vêtements, et il soupçonnait que la plupart de ceux-là travaillaient essentiellement avec des touristes. Au cœur du vieil Albi, il restait une boulangerie-pâtisserie traditionnelle, mais plus de boucherie artisanale. Pour établir ce constat, M. Jourdain avait travaillé dans le quasi-anonymat, et très peu d’Albigeois, même parmi ses alliés, connaissaient son nom de famille. Je l’ai retrouvé par un vendredi matin venteux, sur la place de l’imposante cathédrale Sainte-Cécile, une forteresse en briques érigée il y a huit siècles pour inspirer la crainte aux hérétiques insoumis de cette contrée. En nous engageant dans la rue Mariès, l’artère commerciale principale, M. Jourdain ramena sa capuche sur sa tête pour éviter qu’on le reconnaisse. Je m’efforçais de mon côté de me remémorer l’animation qui égayait, il y a 35 ans, ces rues désormais vides. “De mon point de vue, tant que je reste précis, on ne peut pas m’attaquer”, me dit-il à propos de son travail. “Pour moi, c’est un énorme problème qu’il n’y ait plus d’épicerie dans le centre-ville. Il n’y a plus de café associatif, non plus.” De rue en rue, nous avons pris mesure des failles de la ville. Il manquait des noms sur les interphones des vieux immeubles. Aux étages, les volets restaient clos de jour comme de nuit. Environ 15 % de ces vieilles bâtisses sont vacantes.
world/europe,Il n’a pas fallu longtemps à M. Jourdain, arrivé de Paris en 2013, pour comprendre que quelque chose n’allait pas. “Je m’en suis rendu compte très vite,” m’a-t-il dit. “En face et à côté de chez nous, il y avait deux immeubles magnifiques qui étaient vides. J’ai trouvé ça bizarre. Et puis j’ai commencé à remarquer de plus en plus de commerces fermés.” Nous nous sommes rendus sur la place Lapérouse, du nom du grand explorateur né à Albi au XVIIIe siècle. Je me suis alors souvenu que par un après-midi lumineux, je m’étais assis là, sur un banc, à regarder les vieilles bâtisses qui m’entouraient. L’endroit était assez silencieux pour entendre les oiseaux dans les arbres centenaires qui projetaient leur ombre sur la place. Désormais, ce n’est plus qu’une intersection sans charme, couplée d’une place piétonne sans âme autour de laquelle les voitures filent. Nous avons continué et sommes passés devant deux vitrines qui affichaient les mots “LIQUIDATION TOTALE.” L’image d’un centre-ville dense et vivant d’antan, celui d’un organisme vivant, s’en était allée. “Regardez, avant il y avait un café ici,” me dit M. Jourdain en montrant un magasin de vêtements pour femmes où les restes d’un auvent traditionnel de café français étaient encore visibles. M. Jourdain parle de sa ville avec la ferveur d’un amoureux déçu. Il y a déménagé pour sa beauté et pour échapper à l’agitation de Paris, mais y a surtout trouvé une ville apathique. Il considère désormais que son rôle est d’éveiller la conscience de ses concitoyens. “Le risque est grand pour notre belle cité épiscopale,” écrivait-il sur son blog en 2016.
world/europe,Nous avons ensuite continué vers la rue de la Croix-Blanche, tout aussi vide. De nouveau, nous étions les seuls passants, longeant une enfilade de commerces fermés. Dans la rue Puech-Bérenguier, nous sommes passés devant la dernière épicerie. Rue Peyrolière, nous avons vu l’école abandonnée, fermée en 2013, dans un bâtiment classique du temps de la Troisième République où des générations d’Albigeois ont été éduqués. Sur un mur à l’intérieur, le dessin d’un enfant était encore visible. “Les cris d’enfants ne résonneront plus”, déclara La Dépêche du Midi. Auparavant, le marché couvert avait été un lieu central de la vie de quartier et de commerce, mais plus maintenant. “On sent le temps comme suspendu”, dit M. Jourdain. A mesure que la journée avançait, nous n’avons croisé presque personne dans certaines rues du centre-ville. “Vous voyez clairement que nous sommes dans une rue qui se meurt”, m’a expliqué M. Jourdain à propos de la rue Emile-Grand, alors que nous étions sur le point de terminer notre promenade. “Il y a des bâtiments entiers sans une âme qui vive.” J’ai demandé un rendez-vous avec la maire divers droite, Stéphanie Guiraud-Chaumeil, mais la responsable de communication m’a accueilli avec un manque d’enthousiasme distingué. On m’a promis un entretien téléphonique la semaine suivante, et lorsque j’ai pu enfin échanger avec Mme Guiraud-Chaumeil, celle-ci m’a expliqué que la “dévitalisation” urbaine avait eu un “impact relativement modéré”. Elle s’est aussi empressée de critiquer M. Jourdain. “C’est un extraterrestre”, a-t-elle lâché, “qui arrive pour faire parler de lui.”
world/europe,Le responsable de l’association des commerçants, qui avait organisé la manifestation contre M. Jourdain, fut tout aussi évasif. Il ne se trouvait pas dans le supermarché qu’il gère au sous-sol du marché couvert. Personne n’a pu dire quand il viendrait, ni comment le joindre, et la permanence de l’association en centre-ville est fermée depuis longtemps. Le samedi matin, jour le plus animé de la semaine pour les courses, les commerces et les magasins de vêtements attiraient les clients à l’intérieur de leurs boutiques en promettant des soldes. J’y retrouvais la vie que j’avais découverte des années auparavant, mais parmi les clients du week-end, beaucoup n’étaient pas de la région. Je suis allé retrouver Fabien Lacoste, un membre PS du conseil municipal, dans l’ombre de la cathédrale. Comme la plupart des samedis, il travaillait, vendant des crêpes à l’extérieur. Pour lui, le destin d’Albi est un malheur culturel. Les dirigeants de la ville ont injecté des fonds dans un nouveau centre culturel ultra-moderne au bout de la ville ; le centre commercial a été construit, ainsi que de grands supermarchés, à l’extérieur d’Albi, chacun avec son parking gratuit. Non pas qu’Albi n’ait plus de commerce ou d’activité, mais l’essence de la vieille ville semble perdue. L’émergence de ces centres commerciaux a suivi la nette amélioration du niveau de vie apportée par ce que les Français appellent les Trente Glorieuses, de 1945 à 1975. Le taux de croissance était de 4 %; le pouvoir d’achat d’un travailleur moyen augmenta de 170 %. Les centres commerciaux sont apparus et la vieille ville d’Albi, faite de petits commerces pour les achats du quotidien, ne put satisfaire la demande florissante des consommateurs.
world/europe,Aujourd’hui, la France est le pays européen avec la densité la plus importante de centres commerciaux, et ce en dépit du taux de vacance moyen qui, sur près de 190 centre-villes, s’élevait à 10,4 % en 2015, contre 6,1% en 2001, selon le rapport du gouvernement sur la dévitalisation des centre-villes. C’est le paradoxe français: une nouvelle société de consommation a écorné “l’âme” française, ce qui a empiré, aujourd’hui, avec l’effondrement de la croissance économique. “Il n’y a plus de bar, plus de café. Et nous sommes dans le sud-ouest, bordel! C’est un scandale,” dit M. Lacoste, tout en servant des crêpes à ses clients. “On a perdu cette convivialité qui était notre marque de fabrique. Avant, chaque quartier avait son propre centre, avec son petit café. Et tout ça a disparu aujourd’hui.” “C’est cette dévitalisation-là que je regrette”, a ajouté M. Lacoste. “Plus personne ne vient faire ses courses ici.” Dimanche, Albi avait retrouvé la torpeur habituelle de la semaine. Le soir, en courant le long du Tarn, j’ai croisé une demi-douzaine de personnes, tout au plus. Au crépuscule, la ville semblait abandonnée. J’ai enfin pu rencontrer le responsable de l’association des commerçants, juste au moment où il était en train de quitter son supermarché. Il n’avait pas l’air très satisfait de me voir, encore moins d’évoquer M. Jourdain. “Il y a des centres-villes où la situation est encore plus compliquée,” me dit-il.
world/europe,Mon dernier entretien avant de quitter Albi fut avec Eric Lamarre, qui a fermé le dernier magasin de jouets de la ville l’année dernière. “Le centre-ville était très animé il y a vingt ans,” a-t-il affirmé. “Les gens y venaient vraiment pour faire leurs courses, il y avait des choses charmantes. Et ça grouillait de gens.” Après l’ouverture du centre commercial en 2009, l’activité de M. Lamarre ne cessa de dépérir, jusqu’à ce qu’il perde 50 000 euros par an. “C’est un problème politique,” m’a-t-il dit. “Ces villes ont vécu. Les politiques disent oui sans réserve aux promoteurs des centres commerciaux.” Albi, il conclut, “c’est toujours une ville magnifique — mais pour les touristes.”
us,Police Unions Hail Trump’s Easing of Scrutiny. Local Officials Worry. - The New York Times Black pedestrians in Baltimore stopped without reasonable suspicion. Black drivers in Ferguson, Mo., searched much more frequently than whites. Cleveland residents punched and kicked by officers and subjected to stun guns, without posing any threat. In report after report in the Obama years, Justice Department lawyers found patterns of eye-popping rights violations and used them as leverage to force local departments to agree to major policing overhauls. But the Trump administration announced this week that it was backing away from that tough-minded approach, a move that prompted fierce debate on Tuesday in cities across the country. Many police unions welcomed the news, saying the Obama administration’s approach had impeded law enforcement and unfairly painted many good officers as wrongdoers. The unions, a source of support for President Trump during last year’s campaign, welcomed his administration’s announcement as proof that Mr. Trump would swiftly meet his promises to restore “law and order” to the country. But their view contrasted sharply with those of many police chiefs and politicians who have been living under agreements struck with the Justice Department, who vowed to continue making changes to their police departments with or without the department’s imprimatur. They say that the results of consent decrees, which are backed by a court order, and so-called memorandums of agreement, which are reached out of court, have been mostly positive, if mixed, and in some cases absolutely essential.
us,Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has said he doubts whether federal intervention in local departments is useful or appropriate, ordered a review of those agreements and has signaled his resistance to new ones. In a March 31 memo, he assigned the task to the new deputy attorney general and associate attorney general, who are awaiting confirmation. It is not clear whether Mr. Sessions will seek early termination of agreements in effect in places like Cleveland; New Orleans; Ferguson, Mo.; Albuquerque; and Maricopa County, Ariz. The agreements, which usually expire after five years, mandate changes in training and policies like supervision, reporting contacts with the public, conducting searches, using force, de-escalating conflict, handling people with mental illnesses, and race relations. “What Attorney General Sessions did, I think that’s just President Trump following through on his promise to help law enforcement,” said Stephen Loomis, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association. “And law-abiding citizens are going to benefit from it.” Police unions, individual officers and conservatives often interpret criticism of police practices — whether from Black Lives Matter protesters, Justice Department lawyers or former President Barack Obama — as hostility to the police. They argue that the kinds of changes demanded by the department actually hinder policing by hurting morale and making officers less aggressive, a claim that many criminologists dispute. During the campaign, Mr. Trump picked up that theme and repeatedly referred to a major surge in violent crime — though, in fact, crime in recent years has been at some of the lowest levels ever recorded. He was endorsed by a number of law enforcement organizations, including the national Fraternal Order of Police.
us,In Chicago, where violence has soared in recent years, the city has announced a set of policy changes to address both crime and tense relations between the police and minority communities. In January, the Justice Department released a scathing report on excessive force and racial discrimination, and under Mr. Obama, a consent decree would probably have followed. On Tuesday, Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman, said he could not address what the department might do next in Chicago. Dean Angelo Sr., president of the Fraternal Order of Police chapter that represents Chicago officers, said their problem was not police conduct, but that “they have been demonized by political leaders and others for three years straight.” Meeting last week with Mr. Sessions, “I said, ‘Our girls and guys are worried about losing their jobs for doing their job,’” Mr. Angelo said. “And he goes, ‘That’s not a good thing.’” Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, said that the changes the city had made had improved police training, but that the consent decree created far too much paperwork for officers, limiting their policing time. And he said its restrictions on the use of force were too vague, “which leads to officers being uncertain — they’re hesitant.” But Richard J. Berry, Albuquerque’s mayor, said that while he had some reservations — like the cost of paying court-appointed monitors — he saw the consent decree as largely positive. It may have hurt officers’ morale at first, he said, but “time and experience with it is making it less of an issue.”
us,The dispute illustrates the often stark divides between rank-and-file officers and the police chiefs and mayors who oversee them. For reform-minded bosses, a harsh Justice Department report and several years of court supervision can provide the political cover and authority they need to shake things up. For community activists who complain of police abuses, and who suspect that mayors and chiefs are not sincere about making changes, federal intervention offers a way to hold local agencies to their promises. Baltimore, the subject of another blistering Justice Department assessment, reached a consent decree agreement with the Obama Justice Department, but it has not yet been finalized by a federal judge, and Mr. Sessions asked the court to hold off for 90 days. The city’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, pushed back hard on Tuesday, calling the requested delay “a punch in the gut to the community — certainly to me.” He suggested that Mr. Sessions was out of step not only with people in Baltimore, but with law enforcement leaders across America. Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Baltimore, said he recognized the value of the agreement — which, among other things, would require the city to spend more on needed equipment like laptop computers in police cruisers — but agreed with the attorney general that consent decrees were overused. Officials in cities that are subject to Justice Department agreements, or were headed in that direction under Mr. Obama, said they would continue with reforms no matter what Mr. Sessions did.
us,“The center of gravity on police reform just shifted from Washington to cities around the country,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which advises departments. “But use-of-force and policing reform is not going to go away. Cities like Baltimore and Chicago still have local constituencies that are going to expect change.” Still, some critics of policing are less hopeful, arguing that federal oversight is crucial to hold local leaders to their promises. In Ferguson, more than two and a half years after the police shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, set off weeks of unrest, “life does not feel different for people,” said Emily Davis, a community organizer. Ferguson has been under a consent decree since last year, she said, but “they’re not treating people better.” Ronal W. Serpas recalled that when he was the second-ranking police officer in New Orleans, the Justice Department investigated his department and identified problems. City leaders made some changes and promised others, and no consent degree was imposed. But Mr. Serpas left the city for nine years, and when he returned in 2010 as police superintendent, he said, he found an agency that had moved sharply backward. “While it’s fair to say that the federal government is not in the business of managing local law enforcement, they certainly are in the business of enforcing the Constitution,” he said. “And if not them, who?”
travel,Where and How to See the Total Eclipse This Summer in the U.S. - The New York Times Coast-to-coast solar eclipses are an exceedingly rare occurrence: The last one in North America occurred on June 8, 1918, and after this summer’s Eclipse Across America, there will not be another one like it until 2045. For about two minutes on Aug. 21, the sun will disappear behind the moon across a narrow band called a “path of totality” from the Oregon coast to South Carolina. NASA has set up a site for the eclipse (eclipse2017.nasa.gov), which lists the group’s official viewing locations around the country. And a host of communities in the center of the band, including some that rarely host large numbers of tourists, are staking their claims as the best place to watch the eclipse. A number of other communities in the path, including Columbia, S.C.; Nashville; St. Joseph, Mo.; Casper, Wyo; and Carbondale, Ill., which will have the longest duration of “totality” at 1:21 p.m. for 2 minutes 41 seconds, are preparing for big crowds. Fred Espenak, a retired NASA astrophysicist known as Mr. Eclipse, has watched and photographed 27 solar eclipses on all continents, and says that they are singular experiences everyone should enjoy at least once. He emphasizes that clear weather is key, and that, in this regard, the communities west of the Mississippi River have the best odds. Mr. Espenak will probably be in Casper, where he has a speaking engagement, but he and other eclipse chasers will be watching the weather forecasts, prepared to change plans at the last minute.
travel,Alex Young, the coordinator for NASA’s education and outreach programs, agrees with Mr. Espenak that sites west of the Mississippi have the best odds for good weather, but cautions that travelers need to plan ahead, consult weather forecasts before the eclipse and have a backup plan. He added that prime viewing spots that are easiest to reach could experience problems with congestion and other logistical challenges. “Roughly 100 million people live within a day’s drive of the path of totality, so we’re really in uncharted territory trying to estimate how many people are going to try to watch this event,” said Mr. Young, who plans to be in Carbondale for the eclipse. One backup plan may be an aerial view: Alaska Airlines is giving away two free tickets on an invite-only eclipse charter off the coast of Oregon. Also, NASA will be filming the eclipse at a number of sites across the country and will have multiple streams on its website. But if you want to see the real thing from the earth, here is a list of eight places that have planned celebrations. Madras, Ore. It is a largely agricultural community of 6,000 people in central Oregon that is attracting a huge amount of attention from eclipse chasers, given its reliably clear summer weather and position in the center of the path of totality. Hotels in Madras have been sold out for years. The Days Inn, in nearby Bend, Ore., was advertising standard rooms at $1,600 a night as of May 1. But officials in Madras say there are still plenty of campsites, and visitors will have a chance to take in live music, check out a superb aviation museum, hike at Smith Rock State Park, and sample brews at dozens of brew pubs in Bend.
travel,Hopkinsville, Ky. A farm just outside Hopkinsville has the distinction of being considered the “point of greatest eclipse,” which means that from the center of the earth, the moon makes its closest path across the sun there, giving viewers the best view of the solar corona, which some say looks like a bright diamond ring. Brooke Jung, who is coordinating Hopkinsville’s eclipse marketing efforts, says the eclipse is the most exciting thing to happen to the town — which they are now branding “Eclipseville” — since the same date (Aug. 21) in 1955, when a dozen “little green men” allegedly landed nearby in a spaceship. In addition to their annual Little Green Men Days festival, which commemorates the extraterrestrial occurrence that supposedly inspired the 1982 film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” eclipse chasers can drink moonshine at two bourbon distilleries, attend a Comic-Con event, and take in the  Friday night bluegrass jam at the nearby Rosine Barn. Ms. Jung says that the county has closed schools for the day, ordered 100,000 pairs of solar eclipse glasses ($1 each), and has requested 85 members of the National Guard to direct traffic. “It’s like us and the other towns in the center of the path of totality are preparing to host a Super Bowl,” she said. Jefferson City, Mo. Capital Eclipse Village, in northern Jefferson City is the center of the action, with live music, art installations, circus-style performances, beer and wine stands and children’s activities. The site Capital Eclipse (capitaleclipse.org) lists programming there and elsewhere in Jefferson City. The total eclipse is expected at 1:14 p.m. for 2 minutes 29 seconds.
travel,Lincoln, Neb. Haymarket Park, near the city center, is one of the largest viewing sites in the area. On the day of the eclipse, professors from the University of Nebraska’s department of physics and astronomy will set up sun-viewing telescopes and will be on hand to answer questions. There are a number of other places to see the eclipse and ways to celebrate it, including a “ribfest” ahead of the event and a commemorative T-shirts. The eclipse can also be seen from 125 smaller parks in and around Lincoln. Totality is expected at 1:02 p.m. for 1:24. Although most hotels in Lincoln are sold out during the eclipse period, Tracie Simpson of the city’s Convention and Visitors Bureau office can help you find accommodations. Contact her at tsimpson@lincoln.org or 402-434-5339. Nashville The most promising eclipse event is the Music City Solar Eclipse Festival & Viewing Party at the Adventure Science Center, a popular children’s science museum. Though the festival starts  on Saturday, Aug. 19, the highlight is total eclipse day, where totality is expected at 1:27 p.m. for 1 minute 55 seconds. Indoor activities include multiple showings of Eclipse: The Sun Revealed, a show in the planetarium that the center produced in honor of the eclipse. Outdoors a giant screen will show NASA’s broadcast of the eclipse from space. There will also be science-themed games, food trucks and solar telescope viewing stations. The easiest way to find a place to stay is to search for hotels on the Music City Solar Eclipse Package page, provided by the city’s Convention & Visitors Corp. Make sure that wherever you stay, you listen to the city’s eclipse Spotify playlist.
travel,Casper, Wyo. The community is putting on the Wyoming Eclipse Festival, a five-day celebration culminating on Aug. 21. The festival has more than 40 events throughout the city, including races, music concerts and space-related exhibits. Also, on Sunday, Aug. 20, Ira Flatow, the host of the public radio show “Science Friday,” will give a speech at Casper College’s Wheeler Concert Hall titled “Science Is Sexy.” On eclipse day, when totality is expected at 11:42 a.m. for 2 minutes 26 seconds, the city will have several viewing events such as Solabration on the Circle, at Bart Rea Learning Circle along the North Platte River, which includes guided yoga, children’s activities, breakfast and viewing glasses. The cost is $110 a person plus $33 per car for parking. But it will be tough to find a place to stay. All public campgrounds in the area are sold out, and most hotels are also full. “We’re encouraging travelers to consider alternatives such as private land camping or home rentals through sites such as Airbnb,” said Anna Wilcox, the executive director of the Wyoming Eclipse Festival. Columbia, S.C. The Total Eclipse Weekend lists more than 50 eclipse events taking place in Columbia from Aug. 18 to 21. One example: Solar 17 at Lake Murray, the city’s largest viewing area, will have tents set up, and guests can receive free water and viewing glasses. Totality is expected at 2:41 p.m. for 2 minutes 36 seconds.
travel,Charleston, S.C.: Of the more than 100 eclipse events listed on Go Dark Charleston, one of the largest is expected to be Eclipse on a Warship, which takes place on the aircraft carrier and warship museum U.S.S. Yorktown. Visitors will be able to catch the eclipse from the boat’s flight deck, where Dr. Christian Iliadis, chairman of the department of physics and astronomy at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, will give a presentation on the eclipse and answer questions. Totality is expected at 2:48 p.m. for between 90 seconds to two and half minutes. A full listing of hotels is available on the city’s Convention and Visitors Bureau site. Campsites: Nearly all the hotels in eclipse viewing destinations are sold out the weekend before the eclipse, but some campgrounds still have spots for tents and offer budget-friendly accommodations. According to Hipcamp, an online campground booking site, there are more than a 1,000 campsites in the path of totality with availability; most charge $100 or less a night, and many charge less than $50 a night.

us/politics,At Republican Debate, Candidates Are Likely to Set Sights on Ted Cruz - The New York Times WASHINGTON — In the five weeks since the last Republican presidential debate, terrorists have struck in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Donald J. Trump has proposed barring Muslims from coming to America, Ben Carson’s support has evaporated and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has emerged as Mr. Trump’s stiffest competition. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has gone on the attack against Mr. Cruz, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has less money than many senators up for re-election, has shown signs of life, at least in New Hampshire. All of which is to say that Tuesday night’s debate at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas will showcase a markedly changed race. Mr. Cruz, who is showing signs of consolidating support among hard-line conservatives, is likely to come under sharp attack. Issues like national security and immigration will take on greater urgency. And candidates who are struggling to leapfrog into contention are sure to try to seize on one of the last ripe opportunities to do so before voters in the early nominating states begin making up their minds. But while much has changed, one figure remains the same: Mr. Trump, the leader in national polls and the field’s chief provocateur and pacesetter, whose sometimes outrageous and demagogic comments have not only roiled the race but also amplified divisions between party leaders and the conservative grass roots.
us/politics,Nowhere has that been more evident than with Mr. Trump’s call last week to bar Muslims from entering the country, an inflammatory idea that his rivals will almost certainly respond to at the debate. None of them will second Mr. Trump’s proposal. But the degree to which they repudiate him, or else delicately try to tap into the same fears in a more considered way, will illustrate how they are positioning themselves with Mr. Trump’s supporters. With nearly six in 10 Republicans backing the proposal, but about the same number of Americans over all opposing it, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, the rest of the field must weigh how to avoid appearing out of step with Republican primary voters without appearing to support discrimination in a way that could do grave damage to their prospects in a general election. “The problem for the other candidates is that Trump is initiating and shaping the conversation on national security at a time of great anxiety, and they’re forced to react,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist not affiliated with any candidate, who called Mr. Trump’s proposal “offensive, unconstitutional and entirely unworkable.” “The key is for the other candidates to say, ‘We need to do a better job making our immigration and visa system safer, and here’s an alternative that isn’t rooted in something that would be viable,’ ” Mr. Madden said. The sharpened focus on national security and immigration will also illuminate tensions among Mr. Christie, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, while putting immense pressure on Mr. Carson.
us/politics,Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz have been locking horns for weeks on immigration and national security, and they are likely to clash Tuesday. With Mr. Cruz surging into first place in two recent Iowa polls and terrorism emerging as the top issue, Mr. Rubio is likely to step up his assault on Mr. Cruz for his support of guest-worker visas and of restrictions on some domestic surveillance programs. Mr. Cruz has responded by highlighting Mr. Rubio’s work on a 2013 effort to offer illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship — a major vulnerability for Mr. Rubio among conservatives. In Tuesday’s debate, Mr. Cruz will almost certainly invoke “amnesty” to bludgeon Mr. Rubio, if given the chance. Remarkably, Mr. Rubio’s role in the bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration laws has not been brought up once in the previous four debates. Mr. Rubio, though, would most likely counter — or try to pre-empt such an attack — by questioning Mr. Cruz’s somewhat muddled views about what to do with immigrants already in the country illegally. And Mr. Trump, who advocates mass deportation, could join in the pile-on, now that Mr. Cruz has emerged as his biggest threat. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz can also expect to come under attack from Mr. Christie, who has staked his fortunes on doing well in New Hampshire. There, Mr. Rubio, who is averaging second place in the polls, poses an obstacle to be overcome. “He’s never here,” Mr. Christie said of Mr. Rubio while campaigning in that state over the weekend. “Come on, Marco.”
us/politics,Mr. Rubio’s supporters include some of the center-right voters to whom Mr. Christie is making a case. And both are focused on a muscular response to the rising threat of Islamic State terrorism. Mr. Cruz, meanwhile, has proposed “carpet-bombing ISIS,” using an acronym for the Islamic State, but his support for stricter surveillance laws and his limited experience as a first-term senator will probably invite criticism from Mr. Christie, who has begun more sharply contrasting his experience as a federal prosecutor with the senators in the race. Then there is Mr. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, who took the lead in some national polls this fall but has since fallen sharply amid questions about his grasp of national security. He could fade from contention for good if he is not able to speak authoritatively about how he would confront the threat of terrorism. Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist in Iowa who is advising the “super PAC” supporting Mike Huckabee, said Mr. Cruz could face the most difficult outing. “I would expect that he and Rubio will tussle a little bit,” Mr. Ryan said. But the big question, he said, is Mr. Trump, who until now has appeared to pull his punches against Mr. Cruz. “Sometimes he appears willing to attack Cruz, other times he wants to pretend that they’re best buddies,” Mr. Ryan said of Mr. Trump. “And I think if Trump wants to dispatch him, then he better engage with him.”
us/politics,That would present Mr. Cruz with a potentially pivotal choice: whether to keep turning the other cheek to a front-runner he has sought to embrace, or to strike back against the candidate who could be standing in the way of his nomination.
sports/football,In Jets’ Dismal Start, Faith in Geno Smith Faces an Exacting Test - The New York Times FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —  Rex Ryan sat at the round conference table in his office. An unlit candle, scented Bahama Breeze, rested in the middle. Madonna played softly on the speakers as Ryan gushed about his quarterback, Geno Smith. “Barring injury,” Ryan said, “I’m going to be shocked if this kid doesn’t take off.” Five weeks have passed since this conversation. On Monday, after the team’s third consecutive loss, the Jets’ offense held a players-only meeting. Smith spoke, and he said that he was disappointed in himself. For the turnovers, he told them, seven in four games. “I’ve just allowed some of those things to happen, which I can’t let happen,” Smith said. The theme of regret, of remorse, filtered throughout One Jets Drive on Monday. Smith again apologized for cursing at a heckling fan as he walked toward the Jets’ locker room after their 24-17 defeat to Detroit. Ryan apologized to Jets fans for the team’s performance. “It’s been frustrating at times because you’re giving everything you have,” Ryan said, “and unfortunately it hasn’t been good enough these last three weeks.” Players-only meetings are not held when a team is winning, when its quarterback is thriving and harnessing his emotions. They are held when a team scores three touchdowns in its last 10 quarters and drops six passes and is called for four false-start penalties on offense, a transgression that Ryan, for a home game, considered inexcusable. They are held when a quarterback misfires to open receivers, bypasses running room for 6-yard completions on third-and-9, and makes poor decisions and worse throws.
sports/football,The meeting was helpful, Smith said, because it allowed players to vent, to express their feelings — in a positive manner, he stressed — in private. Not, say, in full view of exasperated fans, some of whom spent part of their Sunday booing Smith and chanting for Michael Vick. “It can’t happen,” Ryan told Smith on Monday. Smith said, “I should never let that situation get escalated that far.” Smith had conducted himself with professionalism in his previous 19 games — before, during and afterward. When praising him, teammates and coaches have lauded Smith’s composure, a constant no matter how dire the circumstances. His decision to lash out Sunday, however provoked, reflected poorly on him, as he said. It also, for the first time, invited the perception that all of this — the losing, the pressure of the job, the turnovers upon turnovers, the presence of Vick — could be affecting him. Smith disagreed, as did Ryan. “It’s not appropriate —you’ve just got to handle it — but I don’t think it’s the other pressure,” said Ryan, who was fined $75,000 by the league for yelling an obscenity at a fan as he walked off the field at halftime of a game against New England in 2011. “I think it’s more the frustration part of it.” Some of that frustration might derive from the Jets’ hope, and, to a degree, their expectation, that Smith would no longer be making these mistakes. This many, at least.
sports/football,Since last season ended, Ryan, his coaching staff and the offense have spoken highly of Smith’s improvements, and that enthusiasm buoyed the Jets during training camp. It was apparent that Smith was a better quarterback than he was last season, and that remains true, regardless of the Jets’ struggles so far. He has not regressed. But it is possible, and only the Jets know for sure, that Smith may not be improving quickly enough. As with Mark Sanchez before him, Smith’s encouraging moments are often overshadowed, or nullified, by critical mistakes, such as his two fourth-quarter turnovers Sunday. The only quarterbacks with a lower passer rating this season than Smith are Jake Locker, Josh McCown and Matt Cassel, who are all injured and did not play in Week 4. “He has to live through this; he has to fight through this,” Vick said. Smith will get that chance. Ryan reiterated his support Monday, saying that Smith would be “one of the main reasons” why the Jets would rebound from their ugly start. It is natural to wonder, though, whether Ryan will consider a change if Smith and the Jets continue to flop. Asked if he could rescue the Jets, Vick tried to deflect the question. “I’m only one person,” he said. “I can’t answer your question until I actually go out there and play three or four games, and then maybe we could talk about it. As of right now, I can’t say I’ll be the difference maker.”
sports/football,The Jets’ quarterback situation could come into sharper focus next week, after their game in San Diego against the soaring Chargers. Maybe that is when the Jets will catch the ball, throw accurate passes, convert in the red zone. Maybe that is when the kid takes off. EXTRA POINTS Fullback Tommy Bohanon fractured his clavicle Sunday and is out indefinitely. ... The Jets released Jalen Saunders, a fourth-round draft pick, and cornerback LeQuan Lewis and added two receivers: T. J. Graham, a speedster who caught a touchdown with Buffalo against them last season, and Chris Owusu, whose signing probably indicated that the ankle injury David Nelson sustained Sunday was serious.
world/europe,Angela Merkel to Seek 4th Term as Germany’s Leader - The New York Times BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, under siege domestically but widely seen as a pillar of Western liberalism, announced on Sunday that she will seek a fourth term next year. Slightly hoarse but clearly determined after consulting leaders of her conservative Christian Democratic party, Ms. Merkel said the decision to seek a fourth term was “anything but trivial,” for her country, for her party and for herself. A scientist with a low-key manner, Ms. Merkel rejected the idea that, after the election of Donald J. Trump as president in the United States, she had a lone role in keeping Western liberalism alive. “That is grotesque, even almost absurd,” she told reporters. But she also said that the campaign ahead of the German elections in fall 2017 would be unlike any other she has fought in an increasingly polarized country. She faces stronger challenges on the right and left, while the war in Syria, the arrival of large numbers of migrants and the continuing euro crisis tear at Germany and place new demands on its people. Since the election in the United States, speculation had mounted that Ms. Merkel would bow to pressure to run again and uphold liberal values in a world transformed by Mr. Trump’s victory and Britain’s vote last summer to leave the European Union. Ms. Merkel, 62, has served 11 years as chancellor. She is the first woman and the first person raised in Communist East Germany to hold the post.
world/europe,Since coming to power in 2005, Ms. Merkel has gradually acquired a political stature commensurate with the power of her country, Western Europe’s largest economy and its most populous nation, with about 81 million inhabitants. But her image as the cautious caretaker of her country’s interests has suffered over the past year, after she opened Germany to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many of them Muslim refugees fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa. The prospect of integrating almost 1 million newcomers into Germany has weakened Ms. Merkel’s standing at home, despite garnering some praise, particularly from President Obama. Visiting Berlin last week, Mr. Obama lavished compliments on his longest-standing ally in his eight years in office, saying that if he were German, he would vote for her. Ms. Merkel responded to the election of Mr. Trump with a robust appeal for him to follow Western values and respect human dignity. This, she said, was the basis of any close cooperation. Even as commentators and leaders outside Germany invoked her stature, Ms. Merkel has been eager not to hog the limelight. “One person alone can never solve everything,” she said on Friday at a news conference with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain. “We are strong only together. In that, I want to do what my duty is as chancellor.” In the days before her party leadership met on Sunday, several Christian Democrats said that the next parliamentary elections would be difficult to win with Ms. Merkel, but impossible to win without her.
world/europe,As she entered the atrium of her party headquarters on Sunday, she was applauded by about two dozen people on a second-floor balcony. While Ms. Merkel mentioned several times that her ability to continue would be contingent on good health, she showed little weariness and gradually became almost feisty as she outlined the challenges to German industry and citizens in the 21st century. Germans should stick to their tried and tested concept of “social market economy,” a blend of welfare state and capitalism, as they navigate this new world, Ms. Merkel said. But she acknowledged that even in this conservative and comparatively wealthy country, politics has been thrown into turmoil by the rise of the populist, right-wing Alternative for Germany party. It is now in 10 of the country’s 16 state Parliaments and seems certain to win seats in the federal Parliament next year. That would scramble conventional coalition building, since no mainstream party has been willing to govern with the populists. Frauke Petry, one of the leaders of Alternative for Germany, criticized the idea of Ms. Merkel’s gaining another four years in office. “Germany cannot afford another term for Angela Merkel,” Ms. Petry wrote on Twitter. Ms. Merkel’s role as a beacon of liberal values may also be dented by the power of populism elsewhere in Europe, whose union has been thrown into ever greater doubt since Britain, the Continent’s leading military power, voted in June to leave the European Union.
world/europe,Next month, Italy votes on constitutional reforms that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi considers crucial to his country’s modernity. Austria will choose a president in an election plagued by delays, and may see the first far-right politician elected as head of state in modern Europe. The Netherlands, France and Germany all hold pivotal elections next year, with the ballot in France being closely watched as a bellwether for the strength of populism as embodied by the National Front of Marine Le Pen. Speaking in Berlin last week, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France predicted that “Europe can die” as a result of the populist wave and the economic and political dissonance in the 28-nation European Union. Ms. Merkel has guided Germany and, increasingly, Europe though myriad crises. She was chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis, and was much criticized for German insistence on austerity during the Greek debt crisis and the subsequent pressure on the euro. Since Russia flexed its military muscle by seizing Crimea and meddling in Ukraine in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the main Western interlocutor to President Vladimir V. Putin. Ms. Merkel has also led her country in abandoning nuclear power, and has moved her conservative party firmly to the center on social policy. Her personal ratings peaked in 2014 at over 80 percent, when she was handling the Ukraine crisis, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung’s compilation of readings on the Politbarometer poll since she took office. On that scale, her lowest score was 50 percent in late 2010, when Germany joined European efforts to avert a bankruptcy by Greece.
business,For Women in Midlife, Career Gains Slip Away - The New York Times Tracy Murphy was managing a nonprofit agency five years ago when her mother became seriously ill with heart problems. She promptly left her job to care for her, a task that has consumed Ms. Murphy ever since. “For me, it was a no-brainer,” said Ms. Murphy, who lives in Syracuse. “When I was growing up she sacrificed for me.” Ms. Murphy, 54, set aside her career aspirations, drained her savings account and eventually sold her gold jewelry to help make ends meet while shuttling her mother, who is 85, to doctors’ appointments and running errands. “I always felt like I can find another job eventually — but I only have one mother,” she said. Ms. Murphy is part of a small but economically significant group that is bucking a powerful decades-long movement of women of all ages into the labor market. In the years since the last recession began, many women like Ms. Murphy, in their late 40s and early 50s, have left the work force just as they were reaching their peak earning years. The demands on middle-aged women to care for their parents, particularly during difficult economic times that force many families to share resources, are not the only reason for the shift. Some economists also attribute the unexpected phenomenon to extensive budget cuts by state and local governments, which employ women in large numbers and were hit harder during this recession than in previous downturns.
business,“It’s a disaster for the women concerned,” said Ian Shepherdson, an independent economist, “but it’s also bad news for the economy because they are not contributing to growth and their skills are eroding through extended inactivity.” As the economy struggles to get back on track, the labor participation rate remains feeble for almost everyone. Still, the losses affecting this group of women — who normally would be in the prime of their careers — stand out from the crowd and highlight the challenges facing middle-aged workers who, for whatever reason, find themselves out of a job. Since the start of the recession, the number of working women 45 to 54 has dropped more than 3.5 percent. There are now about one million fewer women of that age in the labor force than at their peak at the end of 2009. For younger women the rate of decline was about 2 percent — and many of those in their 20s dropped out to return to school or left the work force temporarily to focus on caring for young children. Men, too, have been pushed out of the labor market as jobs in the construction and manufacturing industries have been slow to return. But the rate of decline among adult men has largely tracked the curves of the economy and has been spread more evenly across ages. Mr. Shepherdson, who highlighted the drop in working women in a recent report for his firm, Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that even in a slow-growing economy “women’s participation should not have fallen at all, especially among the women in their prime earning years.”
business,The fact that more elderly people are living longer may be behind many middle-aged women’s decision to stop working. Most employers do not offer flexible schedules for workers caring for elderly family members. And increasingly, women in their 40s and 50s are sandwiched between caring for aging parents and their own dependent children, including young adults still living at home. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in October 2013 reported that 27 percent of the women surveyed had quit their job to care for a child or family member. Sarita Gupta, co-director of Caring Across Generations, an advocacy group for home care workers and patients, said the difficulties can stack up. “Women are falling out of the work force to be primary caregivers to aging parents,” she said, “but as women go out of the work force it means they sacrifice their own financial security.” AARP’s Public Policy Institute estimates that women 50 and over who leave the work force permanently to care for a parent lose nearly $325,000 in wages and benefits. “It saves a lot of money but there’s a huge personal sacrifice,” said Jeannie Brown, 49, of Belgrade, Mont., who left her job as an accounting clerk for county government in 2009 to care for her disabled granddaughter and her mother, who had a stroke. The toll that caregiving takes is more than financial. Researchers say depression and anxiety are common among women who care for an older relative.
business,The decline in public employment also appears to have played a major role in the exodus of middle-aged working women. Between September 2008 and April of this year, 640,000 state and local government workers lost their jobs, according to Labor Department data. Almost half were in education, an industry where a typical employee is a woman in her 40s. In Birmingham, Ala., for example, most of the nearly 300 teachers laid off in recent years were women who had been with the district 15 to 20 years, according to the local teachers union. In Trenton, many of the roughly 200 school district workers laid off since 2009, union officials said, were female support staff members who lost their jobs when cafeterias, paraprofessional services and school security teams were privatized. In Chicago, Katherine White was laid off in 2011 from her job teaching writing and history to fifth and sixth graders. Initially, her life was a whirl of activity as she fine-tuned her résumé and applied for numerous full-time teaching positions. “I tell you, I really thought I had the job in a lot of cases, and it didn’t happen,” Ms. White, 56, said. In 2012 she accepted a temporary teaching position for one semester. When that job ended, she started firing off résumés again. “No nibbles in over a year,” she said. She picked up a few tutoring jobs to help pay her bills, but a few weeks ago Ms. White abandoned her search. She signed up for computer technology classes in hopes of finding a job in a new field.
business,“A lot of teachers, we say we’re too young to retire and too old to be competitive with the market out there,” she said. “We’re between a rock and a hard place, and you have to know how to navigate through it and reinvent yourself.” Some economists think jobs for women in education and other fields will come back eventually, assuming the economy picks up steam and government budgets improve. The dropout trend is “interesting and potentially disturbing but it may be transitory,” said Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University labor economist and expert on women and the economy. By contrast, Ms. Goldin noted, the participation rate for women 55 and over increased in the years after the recession, suggesting that many older women are eager to keep working as long as they can. For women laid off after having settled into a career, the hurdles, both real and imagined, can be significant, according to job counselors. Middle age is a fragile time, they say, and older women often lack the confidence of younger women when forced to look for a new job. They also face the challenges of all older workers: Employers may view them as too expensive, overqualified or out of touch with the changing demands of the workplace. Denice Sharpe, 51, was laid off from her information technology job in Durham, N.C., in September 2008, the same month Lehman Brothers collapsed. In 2012, she finally gave up looking in her field and enrolled in culinary school. She is hoping to start a business creating a line of low-carbohydrate fresh food.
business,“Those of us who have been put out to pasture prematurely should actually be about creating a new economy based on small businesses and based on whatever kinds of talents you have that weren’t being used in a formal 9-to-5 job,” she said. Sharon Ritchie, 51, has been looking for work since she was laid off in 2009 after a 16 year-career at a state-run hospital in New York. She lives in Yonkers with her mother, who has helped her financially. “After a while you get tired of hearing no, no, no,” she said. But “I don’t give up. That ain’t me.”
us/politics,Fact Check: Trump Misleads About The Times’s Reporting on Surveillance - The New York Times WASHINGTON — In an interview with Time magazine on Wednesday, President Trump cited The New York Times as evidence of his claim, made in a series of Twitter posts on March 4, that President Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. The F.B.I. director, other top intelligence officials and numerous Republicans have rejected this claim. Here’s an assessment of Mr. Trump’s references to The Times’s reporting. False. Mr. Trump was referring to an article published online on Jan. 19 and in print on Jan. 20 that disclosed that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of Mr. Trump. There were in fact two different headlines on the online and print versions of the article, which is typical. At no point was either headline altered. Times headlines often differ in print and online, in part because of variations in presentation and in part because of space. This disparity is always noted at the end of the web version and has been noted since the story was first published in print on Jan. 20. In this case, the article appeared in print with the headline, “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides,” followed by two subheadlines, “Examining Russian Ties” and “Business Dealings of Campaign Advisors Are Investigated.” Online, the headline read, “Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates.”
us/politics,As the conservative publication National Review has reported and as the Wayback Machine’s archive of the 336 caches of the story shows, the web headline has remained the same from initial publication... ...to two days after Mr. Trump made his accusation on Twitter... ...to Thursday, March 23, the day his interview with Time magazine was published. This is misleading. Neither the print nor online version of the article supports Mr. Trump’s accusation that Mr. Obama ordered surveillance on him. The Times reported that there were intercepted conversations involving Mr. Trump’s associates, but it did not report that they or Mr. Trump were the subject of wiretap orders. To date, The Times has not found evidence of that. Mr. Trump’s initial accusations specifically targeted Mr. Obama, whom The Times article does not mention. The independent fact-checking website PolitiFact rated Mr. Trump’s assertion False, and The Washington Post awarded the claim Four Pinocchios, its lowest rating, twice. “The bald assertion that Obama had Trump wiretapped is nowhere supported by the story. That is fiction,” said Jay Rosen, a media critic and professor of journalism at New York University. When asked if The Times article could give Mr. Trump a false impression that Mr. Obama wiretapped him, Mr. Rosen said, “It does not. No one reading it in good faith would say that.’’ American intelligence agencies typically monitor the communications of foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and so they routinely sweep up any conversations between American citizens and those officials — called “incidental collection.”
us/politics,For example, it is routine for F.B.I. counterintelligence officials to keep the Russian ambassador under surveillance. Therefore, when Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, spoke on the phone with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition, the government intercepted that conversation because it was wiretapping the ambassador. This is misleading. Mr. Trump did put the word in quotes in two of his tweets, but explicitly accused Mr. Obama of wiretapping his phones. “I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in an early-morning post on March 4. Ten minutes later, he doubled down, writing, “How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!” Again, there is no evidence that Mr. Obama ordered surveillance of Mr. Trump’s phones, nor can a president legally request wiretapping of an American.
us,Minnesota Officer Acquitted in Killing of Philando Castile - The New York Times ST. PAUL — The images had transfixed people around the world: A woman live-streaming the aftermath of a police shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile, and narrating the searing, bloody scene that was unfolding around her. On Friday, a jury here acquitted the Minnesota police officer, Jeronimo Yanez, of all charges in shooting, which happened in July 2016 and left Mr. Castile dead, raising the national debate over police conduct toward black people. Officer Yanez, an officer for the suburb of St. Anthony, had been charged with second-degree manslaughter and endangering safety by discharging a firearm in the shooting. The verdict was announced in a tense courtroom here late Friday afternoon, after five days of deliberations, and the officer was led quickly out of the courtroom, as were the 12 jurors. Mr. Castile’s family, which had nervously watched the proceedings from the front row, abruptly left as well. “My son loved this city, and this city killed my son,” Mr. Castile’s mother, Valerie, said as she stood on a corner outside the courthouse afterward. “And a murderer gets away. Are you kidding me right now?” She continued, “The system in this country continues to fail black people and will continue to fail us.” The case against Officer Yanez — believed to be the first time in Minnesota history that an officer was charged in an on-duty fatal shooting — hinged on one central question: Did the officer have reason to fear that Mr. Castile was reaching for a gun that he had acknowledged having with him when he was pulled over by the officer?
us,Officer Yanez testified that he feared Mr. Castile was grabbing for the gun, but Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, said he had merely been reaching for his identification to give the officer. Though there was dashboard camera video of the events, as well as the live-stream video that Ms. Reynolds began taking after the shooting, there was no video clearly revealing the crucial moments in the front seat of Mr. Castile’s car — and how precisely he had moved his hands before the officer fired. The shooting set off large marches across the twin cities and, at one point, blocked off a major highway. It drew notice from President Barack Obama, as well as the governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, who asked aloud: “Would this have happened if the driver were white, if the passengers were white?” On Friday, as news of the acquittal filtered out, a small group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse, expressing anger and dismay. “It’s not us that were on trial, it was the system that was on trial,” said Mel Reeves, a community activist. Later in the evening, protesters gathered at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul to express their displeasure with the verdict. The police estimated that 1,500 people set off from there on a march, causing traffic backups and transit delays. Mike Padden, a lawyer representing Ms. Reynolds, said he was surprised and disappointed by the verdict. “For those who are committed to the idea of leveling the playing field with law enforcement and the citizenry, it’s a big blow,” he said.
us,John J. Choi, the prosecutor who announced the charges against Officer Yanez, said on Friday that “this verdict brings a lot of hurt and pain and deep-seated frustration for a lot of people in this community.” Mr. Choi said he was disappointed in the verdict, and believed that Mr. Castile “did nothing that justified the taking of his life.” “We gave it our best shot,” said Mr. Choi, the Ramsey County attorney. “We really did.” The acquittal was the latest example of charges against an officer, but not a conviction. In recent years, officers in Cleveland, Pennsylvania and Tulsa, Okla., have been found not guilty of manslaughter. Elsewhere, including Cincinnati and South Carolina, jurors have deadlocked on charges after a fatal shooting and failed to deliver any verdict at all. Among some advocates for police officers, the outcome was met with approval. Earl Gray, a lawyer for Officer Yanez, said he was gratified with the outcome, but frustrated that charges were ever brought. “The state didn’t have a case in the first place,” Mr. Gray said in an interview on Friday evening after the acquittal. “But because of the protests and the political pressure, I suppose you’d call it, he was charged and he had to go into court and defend himself.” Mr. Gray said Officer Yanez was “still very shook up” after the verdict, but “extremely happy it’s over.” “He wants to get on with his life,” Mr. Gray said.
us,As the officer left the courtroom, Judge William H. Leary III had said, “Mr. Yanez, you will now be excused from this matter with no further obligation to this court. Good luck to you.” Despite the verdict, though, officials with the city of St. Anthony, where Officer Yanez has worked for several years, issued a statement late Friday saying that they had “concluded that the public will be best served if Officer Yanez is no longer a police officer in our city.” They said they planned to offer him a “voluntary separation agreement.” In the meantime, the city said, he will not be returning to patrol. Through a week of testimony in the trial, the case had centered chiefly on the conflicting accounts of what Mr. Castile, a longtime school cafeteria worker whom Officer Yanez had pulled over for a broken taillight at twilight on a summer evening, was doing before he was shot. Prosecutors said Officer Yanez had created a dangerous situation, perceived a threat where none existed and, in addition to killing Mr. Castile, almost wounded Ms. Reynolds and her young daughter in the back seat. “He was making assumptions and jumping to conclusions without engaging in the dialogue he was trained to have in a citizen encounter like this,” Jeffrey Paulsen, a prosecutor, said in closing arguments. “And that’s his fault, not the fault of Philando Castile.”
us,Mr. Castile was licensed to carry a gun and was recorded on a dashboard camera video calmly telling Officer Yanez that he had a weapon in the car. Officer Yanez told him not to reach for the weapon, and Mr. Castile and Ms. Reynolds both tried to assure the officer that he was not doing so. Within seconds, Officer Yanez fired seven shots. Prosecutors said Mr. Castile had mentioned his gun to allay concerns, not to threaten the officer or escalate the situation. “If someone were just about to reach in their pocket and pull out a gun and shoot an officer, that’s the last thing they would say,” Mr. Paulsen said. Mr. Gray, the defense lawyer, said Officer Yanez had to react quickly to what he believed was an imminent threat. He said Officer Yanez smelled marijuana, believed that Mr. Castile matched the description of a recent robbery suspect and saw him grabbing a gun. “We have him ignoring his commands. He’s got a gun. He might be the robber. He’s got marijuana in his car,” Mr. Gray told jurors. “Those are the things in Officer Yanez’s head.” Officer Yanez did not tell Mr. Castile about the robbery suspicions, only that his brake light was out. But Mr. Gray said that this approach made sense, and that Officer Yanez had acted reasonably given his training and what he knew that night. “He did what he had to do,” Mr. Gray said, adding that the situation was “tragic.”
us,The jury of 12, including two black people, had to sort through the competing narratives. Both prosecutors and defense lawyers said the video footage supported their version of events. At Officer Yanez’s trial, in this small courtroom in downtown St. Paul, defense lawyers made repeated mention of Mr. Castile’s and Ms. Reynolds’s use of marijuana. The drug was found in Mr. Castile’s car after the shooting, and Mr. Gray said that Mr. Castile had been under the influence of marijuana and delayed in his reactions at the time of the shooting. “We’re not saying that Philando Castile was going to shoot Officer Yanez,” Mr. Gray said. “What we’re saying is that he did not follow orders. He was stoned.” But Mr. Paulsen, the prosecutor, said that version of events was contradicted by video. He said footage showed that Mr. Castile was driving normally, pulled over quickly and was alert and courteous when talking to Officer Yanez. He accused the defense of blaming the victim. “He offered no resistance,” Mr. Paulsen said of Mr. Castile. “He made no threats. He didn’t even complain about being stopped for such a minor offense.”

sports/football,A Business Deal and a Murder, Seen Through the Rearview Mirror - The New York Times WESTFORD, Mass. — A silver 2006 Toyota 4Runner. Mint condition. Only 12,000 miles on the odometer. This is what the car dealer in East Providence, R.I., had to offer an up-and-coming star with the New England Patriots when he arrived at the lot in 2010. There’s a long tradition of businessmen hooking up with professional athletes for an exchange of goods — a quid pro quo for tickets, access to social outings, memorabilia. In this case, the car dealer, Jack Fox, would receive tickets to Patriots games and signed jerseys and footballs, and the player would make promotional appearances for the dealership. It seemed like the beginning of a good relationship. The player traded texts with Mr. Fox regularly and kept up his end of the bargain. “Every once in a while, out of the blue, he would send me a text telling me what was going on in his life and how things were,” Mr. Fox said. Mr. Fox, 64, came to think he might in some way be filling a void in the player’s life from the death of his father several years earlier. He visited the player’s apartment, and met his fiancée and his uncle. The only problem in the first two years was getting the player to bring in the vehicle for regular servicing. At one point, the player called the dealership in a panic because the car wouldn’t start. Mr. Fox dispatched a service employee to the player’s apartment. The car was out of gas.
sports/football,In May 2012, about 21 months since he had taken possession of the vehicle, the player brought it to Mr. Fox for what would be its last servicing. He had put nearly 38,000 miles on it. The player soon stopped communicating with Mr. Fox. Calls inquiring about service or a trade-in went unreturned. Mr. Fox tried a more personal approach, sending one of his salesmen to Gillette Stadium to see if the player would be interested in switching to a newer car. The player declined. The reason, Mr. Fox eventually discovered, was that the vehicle had been involved in a double murder in Boston in July 2012. The player was Aaron Hernandez, whom the authorities accused of shooting two men while inside the 4Runner as the two victims sat in their car at a stoplight. “Early on, I had gotten a call from a Boston detective asking me if I had seen the car,” Mr. Fox said. “I told him I hadn’t. He said, ‘I don’t think you’ll ever see it again. We’ve been looking for it and we can’t find it.’” In June 2013, after receiving a tip, the police finally found the 4Runner, stashed in the garage of Mr. Hernandez’s uncle’s house in Bristol, Conn. They impounded it. That was the same week that Mr. Hernandez was arrested in a separate case, the murder of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Mr. Hernandez’s fiancée. Mr. Lloyd’s body had been found nine days earlier.
sports/football,Mr. Hernandez was indicted in the double murder in May 2014. Months earlier, in September 2013, Mr. Fox had testified in that case for 20 minutes before a Suffolk County grand jury. He testified again at the trial, seeing Mr. Hernandez for the first time since the tight end had made an appearance at a dinner at Kirkbrae Country Club in Lincoln, R.I., for the parts and services employees. “He was terrific that night, too,” Mr. Fox said. “He took pictures with everyone. He talked to the kitchen staff. He was great. He certainly didn’t act like someone who might be arrested for murder.” Seven months after the dinner, Mr. Hernandez was arrested and charged with Mr. Lloyd’s murder. He was convicted in April 2015. Ten months later, Mr. Fox’s lawyer petitioned the court to release the vehicle. The prosecution agreed, but Mr. Hernandez’s new defense team objected. The car would stay impounded for another 15 months. This month a jury hearing the double-murder case acquitted Mr. Hernandez, who was already serving a life sentence in the murder of Mr. Lloyd. Five days after the acquittal, Mr. Hernandez was found dead in his prison cell, an apparent suicide. Two days later, a tow truck showed up at an evidence management facility in the Hyde Park section of Boston. That is where the 4Runner had been impounded since 2013. The vehicle was taken to a used-car dealership here in Westford, where it now sits in a garage next to a vintage black 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and two Hondas in for repair.
sports/football,Mr. Fox finally saw the car the day after it arrived in Westford. Having decided that he and the 4Runner had too much shared history, he gave it to an old friend, Buddy Clair, the owner of the Westford dealership. Mr. Fox even threw in an autographed Hernandez jersey. Mr. Clair has agreed to sell the car, and to divide the proceeds with Mr. Fox. “I think I’ll put it on eBay and see what happens,” Mr. Clair said. “In this day and age, you never know what someone might be willing to pay.” The vehicle’s side-view mirrors are damaged and dangling from their casings. But over all, it is in excellent condition, considering. The odometer reads 53,337. The right front tire needs a little air. And the leather interior is clean and the carpets vacuumed, though there remains a small amount of residue from the long-ago dusting for fingerprints.
books/review,Devils' Advocate - The New York Times VIOLENCE, NUDITY, ADULT CONTENT By Vince Passaro. 300 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $24. FOR a book critic, writing a novel must be pure hell. It's not merely that you're creating a potential pincushion for every other book critic on the planet. What really makes matters difficult is the habitual urge to take things apart and see how they work, which is essential to a critic but often lethal to a novelist: the equivalent of removing a car's engine while you're driving it. Now Vince Passaro, who's been casting a cold and canny eye on contemporary fiction for many years, delivers a novel of his own. Evidently his own wrestling match with the form was a long one: portions of ''Violence, Nudity, Adult Content'' appeared in Esquire more than seven years ago. So it's even more of a pleasure to report that he's come up with a gripping and suitably grimy portrait of how we live today -- if, that is, we happen to live in New York City. Granted, some of the events here could have taken place elsewhere. The protagonist, a lawyer named William Riordan, might just as easily claw his way up the ladder in Topeka, and his collapsing marriage is hardly what you'd call a regional phenomenon. Yet the sheer brutality of the two cases on his plate -- a gang rape and a murder -- will instantly put most readers in a New York state of mind.
books/review,Passaro has a superb feeling for the city's beauty and banality -- indeed, the ''addictive swirl of money and subjugation'' that Will observes in a Manhattan strip club seems endemic to all five boroughs. Passaro is equally good at conveying the crazy compression of Manhattan life, where the verdict on people, places and things tends to be delivered instantaneously: ''We make such severe judgments, so arbitrary and complete. The city, the proximity and danger of contact, force them from us. Observations are too close, too detailed, we know too much about each other in too short a time.'' The plot of ''Violence, Nudity, Adult Content'' (an accurate title, by the way, although the characters spend relatively little time in the sack) cuts back and forth between Will's professional triumphs and his personal failures. This isn't a courtroom thriller: Will excels at ''finding small cracks and handholds in the cliff face of the law,'' and his juridical hairsplitting prevents either case from coming to trial. Yet Passaro gives the so-called discovery process a metaphorical twist. The more Will learns about his clients -- one is so unmistakably guilty that even his own lawyers refer to him as ''an animal'' -- the more the phrase ''justice system'' strikes him as an oxymoron.
books/review,That Will emerges with his conscience intact is something of a miracle. The same thing might be said of his marriage, which seems primed for an explosion from the first chapter. ''It is difficult,'' Will thinks to himself, ''to imagine a modern middle-class marriage not syncopated by rage. Love interrupted -- by confusion, by fear, by resentment.'' He and his wife, a miserable stay-at-home mother with two kids underfoot, pepper each other with conjugal buckshot until Will is finally ejected from their apartment. Passaro captures their eventual reconciliation perfectly, allowing his irony-prone couple at least a few moments of old-fashioned romance. There are moments, alas, when Passaro makes like a cultural diagnostician and ends up resembling a cut-rate DeLillo -- check out Will's cranky jeremiad about ''the extinction of personality that is television,'' which makes you wish he'd lighten up. Then there are those interpolated e-mail messages from Ursula, the rape victim. At first her pious indictments of men in general and Will in particular add a certain grit to the proceedings, but before long the mere appearance of that sans-serif typeface will fill both male and female readers with stupefied dread. These flaws, along with a certain looseness in the narrative joints, can probably be chalked up to the book's long gestation. Luckily, they're not sufficient to sink a first novel as accomplished as this one; let's hope that Passaro's next novel hits the shelves sometime before 2009.
nyregion,Double-Takes by the Governor in Casting a Senator - The New York Times Gov. David A. Paterson declared on a local radio station last Friday that he had been ready to pull the trigger on his choice to fill the Senate seat held by Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I would probably have done it this weekend,” he said then, adding that he decided to hold off making the announcement until after President Obama’s inauguration, when it would not be such a distraction. Fast forward a few hours later that day to a press conference in Mr. Paterson’s office in Midtown Manhattan. “I’m having new thinking about who I’m intending to appoint and having a few follow-up conversations with some of those people,” he said. It was the kind of double-take moment that has been a hallmark of Mr. Paterson’s process in considering the appointment under endless scrutiny and speculation. That process was upended on Wednesday night when Caroline Kennedy withdrew from consideration. The decision capped an evening of back-and-forth dialogue with the governor’s office that left it unclear for several hours whether she was still interested in the position. Many who watched Mr. Paterson handle the selection process agreed that it was a distracting ordeal that risked slighting some of the contenders for the job and dinging Mr. Paterson’s credibility. “It’s like a game show,” Martin J. Golden, a Republican state senator from Brooklyn, said Wednesday. “There’s no reason to have hammered this out as long as he did. It’s a fiasco.”
nyregion,Of course, had Mr. Paterson announced his choice earlier, he could have avoided the embarrassing sequence of events that unfolded on Wednesday night. The high-stakes nature of the appointment, with the political celebrity of the contenders and the intense interest they drew, seemed to catch Mr. Paterson off balance at times throughout the nearly two months since Mrs. Clinton’s name first surfaced as a potential secretary of state to Mr. Obama. The speculation that followed the governor wherever he went often has been a tripwire for a man known for a relaxed approach to managing and a tendency to speak off the cuff. Some of the confusion has been of his own doing, and other times it has been caused by the actions of those under consideration. Ms. Kennedy’s swing through upstate New York in December turned into a media circus as hordes of television cameras and reporters followed her from Syracuse to Rochester to Buffalo for meetings with officials. The trip caused two members of New York’s Congressional delegation, Steve Israel of Long Island and Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan, to make their own whistle-stop tours upstate this month, inviting criticism that they were adding to the frenzy. For his part, Mr. Paterson has conducted the selection process much like a business owner placing a want ad. He has encouraged people to reach out to him, invited them in for interviews and asked candidates to fill out a lengthy questionnaire that asked things like whether they had ever been fired from a job or had employed illegal immigrants as household help.
nyregion,Mr. Paterson’s secrecy only fueled the speculation: He refused to release the questionnaire and he would often not answer when asked whom he had interviewed. And when he has disclosed information about the process, often the result has been confusion. For example, his aides said on Tuesday that he had interviewed Byron Brown, the mayor of Buffalo, late that afternoon. But earlier in the day Mr. Paterson told reporters he had essentially settled on a choice. Despite the vagueness of many of his public answers, Mr. Paterson has rarely shied away from the opportunity to speak about the issue. When he was in Washington this week for the inauguration, he was interviewed by MSNBC and CBS and twice by CNN. He even told reporters at an inaugural ball on Tuesday night that he had spoken with the actress Sharon Stone about the appointment. “Sharon Stone mentioned someone, but I don’t remember who it was,” a tuxedoed Mr. Paterson said. And he has seemed to relish the attention at times. While making his way across the ballroom floor at the Washington Convention Center on Tuesday night, he could not take more than a few steps without being stopped by people eager to offer unsolicited advice. Some have accused him of exploiting the moment. “It looks like sort of a cat-and-mouse game, like he’s having fun with it,” said George H. Winner, a Republican state senator from Elmira. Mr. Paterson rejects that notion. “Believe me. The last thing I need right now is any more attention,” he said.
nyregion,With Ms. Kennedy exiting the field, however, Mr. Paterson is assured of more attention.
fashion,Watches See a ‘Brexit’ Boom - The New York Times LONDON — The effect on the value of the pound of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has rarely been out of the headlines since the June 23 referendum. But while the markets panicked — an estimated $2 trillion was wiped off world markets the day after the vote — the decline of the currency has proved a boon for Britain’s luxury watch retailers. With watches priced in pounds — particularly those at the high end — suddenly much more attractive to the international market, customers from all over the world have been buying in Britain. London has felt the biggest “Brexit” boom. According to the global market research company GfK, sales of watches priced at more than 10,000 pounds, or about $12,320, were up 67 percent in the British capital in September, compared with the same period last year. And the figure was almost as high outside London, up 56 percent. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry reported that exports to Britain were up 32.4 percent year over year in September, making the country the world’s fourth-largest importer of Swiss watches. In 2015, it was eighth. “Brexit has been hugely beneficial,” said Brian Duffy, chief executive of Aurum Group, which he said accounts for 46 percent of all British watch sales through its network of Watches of Switzerland, Mappin & Webb and Goldsmiths stores. “There are undoubtedly more tourists, and they’re looking to spend, because they’re confident in the value they’re getting. Luxury watch sales across the group are up by 40 percent, end of June to Week 1 of October.”
fashion,David Coleridge, chairman of The Watch Gallery, which operates showrooms in Selfridges on Oxford Street and in Manchester, as well as a Rolex boutique in the ultraluxury apartment building One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, said Brexit had created “the perfect storm.” “In July, dollar-based Arab customers arrived after Ramadan and discovered that London was almost free,” he said. “Then there was publicity around the world that the pound had slid and it was cheap to go to London, and visitor numbers leapt up. And then terrorism in Europe meant more people coming here.” Sales by a rival retailer in Paris are down 50 percent, Mr. Coleridge noted, adding that even the highly publicized Oct. 2 robbery of Kim Kardashian West, in which jewelry worth millions was stolen while she was visiting Paris, has had an effect. Brands agree that Britain’s market has improved. Vacheron Constantin opened its Bond Street boutique in 2013 and while it had a slow start, the company’s brand manager in Britain, Celine Larose, said sales are picking up post-Brexit. “Our clients are very price-sensitive,” she said. “But they are no longer waiting.” And those sales increases have come despite what brands, including all the Richemont-owned houses such as Cartier and Montblanc, are calling inevitable price increases as they try to offset the global imbalance caused by the falling pound. “We put our prices up by 10 percent at the beginning of August,” said Mark Hearn, Patek Philippe’s managing director for Britain. “We try to ensure the playing field is level all around the world. If you have one market that is dramatically cheaper than everywhere else, there are customers who will gravitate to whichever market is significantly cheaper.”
fashion,In Britain, for example, Cartier announced a 10 percent rise after the June vote. Roger Dubuis followed an 8 percent price rise in August with a further 6 percent increase taking effect Nov. 1, the same day that Rolex, which had not increased prices in Britain for three years, announced a 10 percent rise. Now the challenge that brands face is convincing the domestic market that it is still a good time to buy. “While increasing U.K. retail prices will mean that a fine watch purchase needs to be even more considered by a domestic client than usual,” said Helen David, Harrods’s chief merchant, “generally, watch purchases, particularly at the higher end, are investment purchases, and as such we continue to see upward movement.” She added that Harrods’s luxury watch division is experiencing high double-digit growth this year. Richard Mille, whose watches frequently sell for six figures, takes a different approach. “We have a price list in Swiss francs, and we sell at the spot rate on the day,” said Peter Harrison, the company’s chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “It’s the fairest way for our customers — that way, whether they’re spending in pounds, euros or dollars, it’s up to them when they spend.” Not all brands are bowing to the pressures created by the weakening of the pound: Swatch Group and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton brands such as TAG Heuer and Hublot have held prices stable, absorbing shrinking margins in a bid to protect local business. Retailers, however, are expecting LVMH’s watch division to raise prices in the new year.
fashion,“Omega and Swatch Group are not opportunistic,” said Raynald Aeschlimann, Omega’s president and chief executive. “To increase sales would go against our domestic market. For British customers, nothing has changed and we want to keep momentum with those local customers. Raising prices would send a wrong signal.” Mr. Hearn said Patek Philippe’s price increase had not affected local business and said that despite the increase, Britons would continue to buy at home. “If it’s cheaper in the U.K. for tourists, it’s also cheaper for U.K. customers to buy here, as opposed to buying abroad,” he said. “Certainly, there are Patek Philippe owners in the U.K. who would have been interested in shopping in Hong Kong, the U.S. or Switzerland who choose to buy in the U.K. now.” The question that brands and retailers are asking themselves is how long the Brexit boom will last. Sales of luxury watches in Britain were on an upward curve before the vote, plumped up by London’s improved reputation as a tourist destination over the past decade and by investment by brands and retailers in retail experience in the city, as well as by redirected sales because of security issues on the Continent. GfK’s figures indicate British sales of watches that cost more than £1,000 grew 19.5 percent between January and August, with significant growth even before the departure vote. “Without considering Brexit, our business has dramatically increased in the U.K.,” said Ricardo Guadalupe, Hublot’s chief executive. “Brexit was the icing on the cake, but other geopolitical variables such as terrorist attacks and the current feeling of insecurity have more severely jeopardized business in Europe.”
fashion,London also benefits from the variety of its tourist customers. “Compare London to Hong Kong — it’s suffering because it’s so reliant on Chinese customers,” Mr. Coleridge said. “London has a mix. We’re even selling to Americans, now. Rolexes are 35 percent cheaper here than in New York.” Many experts predict a further fall in the value of the pound, posing a continuing problem for brands looking to manage a balanced global pricing strategy. But confidence among British retailers is high. “The U.K. will remain advantaged for the future,” Mr. Duffy said. “We were doing well before Brexit, despite being disadvantaged by a strong pound and visa restrictions. The consumer has confidence in the U.K. market.”
us/politics,Sean Spicer Misquotes Evelyn Farkas in Latest Defense of Trump’s Wiretapping Claim - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, continued on Friday to use misdirection and misleading claims to defend President Trump’s contention that former President Barack Obama spied on him, as well as Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns. Here is an assessment. THIS IS MISLEADING Mr. Spicer is distorting Ms. Farkas’s potential knowledge of the situation, what she actually said and the context in which she said it. Ms. Farkas served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia from 2012 to October 2015, and had left the administration well before 2016, when Mr. Trump claims, without proof, Mr. Obama wiretapped his phones. After her remarks were cited by many conservative media outlets as validation of Mr. Trump’s accusations, Ms. Farkas noted on Twitter on March 29, “I was out of govt, had nothing 2 give.” Second, Ms. Farkas did not say Mr. Obama spied on Mr. Trump, but instead expressed concern that intelligence on Russia would be buried or sources would be compromised under the new administration. According to Mr. Spicer, this is what Ms. Farkas said, although the part in bold seems to be Mr. Spicer’s own addition: “I was urging my former colleagues, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill. I was telling people on the Hill, ‘Get as much information as you can. Get as much intelligence as you can.’ I had a fear that they were essentially watching the Trump staff and he was worried about the Trump administration.”
us/politics,Here is what Ms. Farkas actually said: “I was urging my former colleagues, and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill — it was more, actually, aimed at telling the Hill people: Get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration, because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people that left. So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy.” She went on to say: “That the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff’s dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried, because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more.” And third, Ms. Farkas was discussing a March 1 New York Times article about Obama administration officials seeking to preserve and spread information Russia’s interference in the election, in order to leave a clear trail and to prevent interference in other elections. The Times reported that American intelligence agencies and U.S. allies had surveilled Russian officials. Nowhere does the article state that Mr. Trump or his associates were the targets of intelligence gathering. FALSE Mr. Trump was the first presidential nominee not to release his tax returns in four decades. His campaign, and now his White House, has said this is because they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He instead opted to release financial disclosure forms — which, as Mr. Spicer noted, he is legally required to do.
us/politics,But Mr. Spicer is wrong when he says that Mr. Trump is the first president to publish the forms on the White House website. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s financial disclosure forms and tax returns were posted on the White House website every year. THIS IS MISLEADING Mr. Spicer called the disclosure forms “a fairly comprehensive undertaking of every asset.” When asked why Mr. Trump has yet to release his latest tax returns, which are not under audit, Mr. Spicer said equating the returns with financial disclosure forms was “apples and oranges,” and he’s right. Tax returns are actually far more comprehensive. As PolitiFact has reported, financial disclosure forms do offer valuable information about Mr. Trump’s finances. But tax returns also include his effective income tax rate, the type of taxes he paid, his charitable giving and a clearer sense of his liquid assets.
nyregion,A Bullet Misses Its Mark, and Then Takes a Fatal Detour - The New York Times A quarter-ounce of copper-jacketed lead exploded from the barrel of a 9-millimeter pistol at 1,300 feet per second. The bullet sped toward 28-year-old Carlos Vasquez, who ran just steps ahead of the gunman. But it missed its mark, just outside the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx, and kept whistling through the air. It sailed for 150 yards along East 154th Street, down the slope between Courtlandt and Elton Avenues, staying airborne as the ground fell away. Maribel Cavero, 45, was crossing the street at the base of that hill, unaware that a shot had been fired during a running fight between young men in the housing project. She had just delivered a carton of sugar substitute to her diabetic grandmother on East 154th Street and was on her way to pick up her 13-year-old niece from school. The bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped. Then, with the last of its fading energy, it tore into Ms. Cavero. Alejandro Almonte, 45, a passer-by, heard Ms. Cavero yelp and saw her fall. He later said he thought she must have had a seizure. He ran to where she lay, facedown, on the blacktop by a small car’s bumper. She was dying, the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12:50 p.m. on Nov. 2, a sunny Wednesday. The slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a Jeep parked near a wood-frame house at 426 East 154th Street.
nyregion,The bullet was strangely pristine, hardly deformed by its deadly work. As investigators began to piece together how the woman had been shot, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, looked uphill, where the bullet had been fired, and downhill, where it had come to rest, and surveyed the maze of telephone poles, streetlights, wires, cars and trees in between. The bullet had improbably traveled nearly two city blocks to strike an unintended victim and log the precinct’s 14th — and final — homicide of 2016. “It couldn’t have hit a tree?” he said, shaking his head. “A light pole? A sign?” It was grim news for detectives in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times has been examining every homicide logged in 2016, a succession of drug-related assassinations, gang killings, domestic murders and random slayings. Half the cases remained unsolved, and Sergeant LoPuzzo’s investigators were already struggling to find the person responsible for the fatal shooting of another innocent bystander, Jessica White, cut down on a playground in June. Now, less than a mile away and five months later, the police had another mystery and another blameless bystander lying crumpled on the ground. Detectives were initially unable to explain what had happened. The mayor’s office called the chief of detectives, and the chief of detectives called Sergeant LoPuzzo. The message was simple: Do all you can.
nyregion,The department flooded the streets with rookies who picked through trash and shined flashlights in alleyways and sewer grates searching for any potential evidence. Detectives checked Ms. Cavero’s background for clues. The head of Bronx detectives, Deputy Chief Jason Wilcox, stalked the streets between the projects and the businesses on Third Avenue, the area around him abuzz with the police. It was a striking show of force, and a marked escalation from the police response after Ms. White was killed as she tried to shield her children from gunfire. As the afternoon hours wore on, Sergeant LoPuzzo and his detectives started getting breaks. Things lined up in ways they seldom do in this part of the Bronx, where witnesses rarely agree to testify and investigative staffing is one of the lowest in the city despite a violent-crime rate that is the highest. By late the next night, Orlando Oquendo, a 17-year-old who the police believed had fired the bullet, was in handcuffs, having been identified in a lineup by Mr. Vasquez, the man who said he was the target. Mr. Oquendo, who still looked very much a teenager, had been arrested several times, including twice on gun possession charges, according to court documents and his mother. “That kid was on a road,” Sergeant LoPuzzo said. “It was just a matter of time.” Less than 48 hours elapsed from death to arrest, and what detectives in this corner of the city say they hope for but rarely see came to pass: The police and the people in the community had cooperated to solve a killing.
nyregion,“It’s supposed to read like a book,” Sergeant LoPuzzo said weeks later, explaining how he wished all cases went that way. “Where you can read all the steps in the investigation, and what they saw and what they found and what the video shows and what the evidence shows. So it’s all one big package.” It was a luxury, the sergeant said, his squad often did not have. The day she died, Maribel Cavero and her 67-year-old mother, Maria Reyes, had cooked crabs for an early lunch, using a recipe from their native Ecuador. Together, with Ms. Cavero’s younger sister, Alexandra Cavero, 44, they sat at a small table in the family’s fifth-floor apartment in the Melrose Houses, only a block from the corner where the shot would be fired. Ms. Cavero regaled them with family gossip and news from their home country. The sisters had joined their mother in the United States in 2008, about 12 years after she followed her own mother from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to the South Bronx in hopes of more earnings and a better life. When lunch was finished, Ms. Cavero’s mother reminded her to drop off the box of sugar substitute to her grandmother, Marcela Troncoso, the 86-year-old family matriarch, who lived in an apartment on East 154th Street. As she did most days, Ms. Cavero was headed to pick up her sister’s 13-year-old daughter, Gabriela Encalada, from school, because her sister had to leave for her job as a bus driver. But Ms. Cavero would make time for the delivery.
nyregion,“She said, ‘I’m in a hurry, but I’ll do it,’” Ms. Reyes said in a recent interview. “‘I’ll do it.’” Ms. Cavero had no husband, no boyfriend and no children, her relatives said. She enjoyed certain solitary pursuits, like romance novels and the online game FarmVille. And aside from family, her regular social activity was Mass at Immaculate Conception Church on East 150th Street. “She lived in her own world,” her sister said. “She was still very naïve.” With what relatives called a tranquil focus, she poured her energy into caring for her mother and helping to raise her niece, whom she considered like a daughter. She loved tragic poetry, her sister said, and the writings of Pablo Neruda and the novels of Corín Tellado, a prolific romance writer. At night, she would watch Elvis Presley movies, referring to the singer as her eternal love. She watched James Bond movies, too, but told friends she avoided real romantic entanglements because in her view they always brought pain. “In high school, they used to say she seemed like she was in love because when she was into a book, into a piece of literature, she expressed it, and the others would tell her, ‘You’re in love,’ and her answer would be ‘Yes, I’m in love with life,’” her sister said. “‘In some ways you seem like a little girl, and in some ways you’re like an old lady,’ I used to tell her.”
nyregion,Ms. Cavero worked for a few years as a part-time nanny, her mother said. But as the children she watched grew, the $100-a-week job ended and she wound up working another job her stepfather found for her at a McDonald’s on Sixth Avenue and 28th Street in Manhattan. The shifts began late in the day, which gave her time to pick up Gabriela. But they often ended near midnight. Coming home that late, she usually called her mother to tell her she was leaving work. Her mother said Ms. Cavero was afraid of the neighborhood. “This is a bad place here,” Ms. Reyes said. “Sometimes gunfights are heard outside.” When the McDonald’s was being remodeled in the fall, Ms. Cavero seized the opportunity to go to Ecuador. She stayed for 45 days with her father, Luis Cavero. She wasn’t thrilled to return to New York, where she had been frustrated in finding meaningful work, and she talked of moving home once her niece was older, her sister said. “Why did this happen?” her sister asked. “I don’t understand. She was a person who had no vices.” For the investigation into Ms. Cavero’s killing, finding the small, smooth slug under a Jeep near the body was the case’s first big break. Detectives who found it cordoned off the area with crime scene tape. One hunched down, unloaded the magazine of his own 9-millimeter pistol and pulled out a bullet to compare. The slugs were the same size.
nyregion,Another bystander told officers he had seen a man running wildly with something black in his hand through the Melrose playground a block and a half away. Detectives traced a ballistic path westward along East 154th Street and found a plumber who told them he had seen the shooting as he walked with his lunch from the Twin Deli Grocery at East 154th and Courtlandt. The plumber told detectives he saw one young man chase another, then stop and raise his arm. He heard a gunshot and the tinkle of a brass shell hitting the sidewalk as the gunman turned back and sprinted into the Melrose Houses. The shell was there, under some scaffolding, on the northeast corner, and detectives placed a white foam cup over it to preserve it as evidence. After detectives went looking for surveillance video, they found footage from at least five nearby stores and buildings, a bonanza in a neighborhood where security cameras are scarce and often out of order. One video showed a teenager racking a gun, dropping something, then firing. On the street, besides the shell casing, detectives discovered an object they believed had also fallen from the gunman’s hands: a silver cigarette lighter. Television satellite trucks began showing up, a rare but welcome sight for investigators in this part of the city, who hoped publicity might encourage witnesses to come forward. The evening news broadcasts were soon underway, and in a place where even horrific killings often draw only brief coverage, the local stations were going big with the news of an innocent bystander shot dead.
nyregion,For Sergeant LoPuzzo, a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes does nothing to blunt his frustration over witnesses who will not speak. In case after case, as recently as a shooting on New Year’s Day, even seriously injured victims tell a similar story: “Felt pain, saw nothing.” But the Cavero case was already going differently, and then a call came from the 40th Precinct station house on Alexander Avenue. Detectives told the sergeant, who was still at the scene, that a man had walked into the second-floor squad room claiming to have been in the gunman’s cross hairs. “I said, ‘Do not let him leave,’” Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled. Within minutes, the man, Carlos Vasquez, was putting his account in writing in front of a detective. In his statement, he said he saw the news of Ms. Cavero’s death on television and realized “that a woman was shot and killed by the bullet that was intended for me.” “I informed my family that I was going to the precinct so I can tell the detectives what happened and tell them I wanted this guy brought to justice,” he said in his statement, which both he and a detective signed. “It’s one of the rare things where he’s got a conscience,” Sergeant LoPuzzo later said. Mr. Vasquez had been arrested more than a dozen times and had been convicted of drug dealing and illegal possession of a knife. He was a well-known, if small-time, drug dealer. He sold in the Melrose Houses near the corner of East 153rd Street and Courtlandt Avenue, where his mother lived, according to court records and the police.
nyregion,In implicating Mr. Oquendo, Mr. Vasquez never explained how the fight had started. In his own words, he said he had left his building on Nov. 2 “in search of marijuana” and was waiting for a dealer near a flagpole at the neighboring Jackson Houses when two men assaulted him. He ran. But before he could make it to the safety of his mother’s house, one of the assailants closed the gap, with a gun in hand. “As I’m running, I turn around to see him point a gun at me and fire it,” Mr. Vasquez said in his statement, though he did not know Mr. Oquendo’s name. “I ducked between cars.” Even before Mr. Vasquez came in, detectives reviewing the recovered video images from the deli’s cameras thought they had identified a suspect. Officers assigned to a plainclothes street-crime unit recognized the person in the surveillance footage as Mr. Oquendo, the teenager with a lengthy arrest record who was known to officers as “Gumby.” The case detective, Ivan Monge, also knew the gunman when he saw the video. He had arrested Mr. Oquendo’s older sister on assault charges in October. “I told myself, ‘Wait, this is Gumby, this is Oquendo,’” he said. Detectives did not recover the gun. But with the videos, the witnesses, the bullet, the shell casing and the name of the suspect lining up, Sergeant LoPuzzo’s team made one more breakthrough: Detective David Rodriguez remembered that the suspect’s mother was an old neighbor of his from Spanish Harlem. They had grown up together, their families had attended the same church and they had spoken after one of Mr. Oquendo’s previous arrests.
nyregion,The detective contacted the mother’s relatives on Facebook and eventually got her on the phone. He told her he needed her to bring in her son safely. “Like a mother, she didn’t believe it,” Detective Rodriguez said. “And she wanted the proof.” Detective Rodriguez went to her home and took her to the squad room, where he showed her a wanted flier with an image of her son taken from the videos. She came in only “because she trusted him,” said Detective John Caruso, another detective working on the case. Finally she broke down. “Yeah,” she said, according to Detective Rodriguez, “that’s my son.” By the next night, the detectives were packed in the lobby of the Legal Aid Society’s office on East 161st Street in the Bronx. Steven Mechanic, a veteran public defender who had represented Mr. Oquendo against several criminal charges in the past, surrendered him to the police. “There are no winners in this case,” Mr. Mechanic said later, declining to discuss the new charges or Mr. Oquendo’s previous convictions. Mr. Oquendo was led away. His parents cried. “He told me he came over from Cuba on a boat, 20 years ago,” Detective Rodriguez said of the suspect’s father. “I know the mother’s side of the family personally. I’ve known them for years. He comes from a good family, but everyone takes their own path in life.”
nyregion,Orlando Oquendo’s mother sat in her living room in the Jackson Houses one recent night, with a stack of letters written by her son in jail piled on her lap. She nodded toward the streets outside her sixth-floor window and spoke of her son’s sorrow for Ms. Cavero’s death. “If he did do it, it was not intentional. It was not toward her,” she said of the shooting. “A person was lost, so it’s going to hurt.” She felt a kinship for Ms. Cavero’s family. Both were Latino families, she said, one from Puerto Rico and Cuba, the other from Ecuador. Both were churchgoing, and both were living in a crime-plagued area they wanted to escape. Mr. Oquendo’s mother said that taking the apartment in the Jackson Houses 11 years ago was the worst decision she had ever made. Mr. Oquendo, the fourth of her six children, was troubled and, from a young age, attended a special school for emotionally disturbed children. It was hard to stay neutral in the project’s ever-simmering gang feuds, and he got into fights constantly. He seemed unable to back down from a threat. He would not “stay shut” when challenged, said his mother, who spoke on the condition that her name not be published. “He had good hands. He could defend himself.”
nyregion,Twice, her son was accused of crimes involving guns, according to court documents and law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential records. In February 2014, a young woman told the police that Mr. Oquendo, who was 15, fired several shots at her, one official said. He was indicted on a gun possession charge in that case, which was transferred to family court and sealed. Then, in August 2015, he was arrested when a police officer saw him drop a .38-caliber revolver wrapped in a T-shirt on Courtlandt Avenue near East 157th Street, a criminal complaint said. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was given a conditional discharge, the official said. Mr. Oquendo’s mother said he was supposed to be graduating from high school this month and then going to work for his father’s plumbing business. Her son had been coaching young basketball players at the local Classic Community Center, on the courts where Chris McCullough of the Brooklyn Nets once reigned. He had proposed to his longtime girlfriend, telling her they could someday move to a safer neighborhood with their son, O. J., born on Aug. 16. “If this kid could relive this day, I’m sure he wouldn’t do the same thing that he did,” Sergeant LoPuzzo said. “But once you pull that trigger, you can’t pull that back.”
nyregion,Still, the pressures were mounting, said Mr. Oquendo’s mother, who referred to him as her “prayer baby” for his constant comfort of her. He watched her battle diabetes and heart disease and saw his maternal grandmother dying of colon cancer. The streets enveloped him, she said. In October, he had a dispute with Mr. Vasquez outside a local barbershop. On the day of the shooting, Mr. Vasquez’s nephew, a friend of the Oquendo family, sent messages to Mr. Oquendo’s sister to find out what had happened. After speaking with Detective Rodriguez, Mr. Oquendo’s mother reached her son and asked him to surrender. “I told him, ‘The best thing to do is to turn yourself in, and let’s see what happens,’” she said. “I don’t want my son out on the run.” Now, he is in a Rikers Island jail cell, facing a five-count indictment on murder and other charges. He turned 18 there and spent Thanksgiving and Christmas alone. But his letters and cards keep coming, almost daily, filled with apologies for letting his mother down and promising to come home. In a letter on Dec. 30, he told her not to worry, writing, “God has a plan,” and “Let’s hope God gives us a short, easy punishment.” Ms. Cavero’s relatives, who are tracking the suspect’s court appearances, are afraid of just that: a light sentence. Detectives said that Mr. Oquendo’s intended victim, Mr. Vasquez, picked him out of a police lineup, but that the plumber who witnessed the shooting had been too afraid to try the same. DNA tests on the silver lighter recovered near the shell casing were inconclusive.
nyregion,In her living room, two blocks from the Oquendo family, Ms. Cavero’s mother, Ms. Reyes, also sat on a couch with a pile of envelopes, these containing court papers and other official documents. She thought back to the moment the police informed her of her daughter’s killing. Detective Monge, the case detective, had knocked on her door to deliver the news in Spanish, and she was grateful for his compassion. But even after a wake, in which her daughter was dressed all in white, and a funeral, in Ecuador, she said the randomness of the death — in which a person with no enemies or vices was taken violently — remained the abiding mystery. It is a question the police cannot answer. “That is what I ask myself,” Ms. Reyes said, tears falling down her cheeks. “Why did this happen this way?”

washington,Gonzales Hearing Delayed After Virginia Tech Shooting - The New York Times WASHINGTON, April 16 — The Senate Judiciary Committee has postponed the hearing, originally set for Tuesday, in which Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales is to testify about the dismissals of eight United States attorneys. The session was postponed because of the shootings at Virginia Tech and is now scheduled to begin Thursday at 9:30 a.m.,  said David Carle, a spokesman for Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the panel. Mr. Carle said Senator Leahy and the committee’s ranking Republican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, decided to reschedule the hearing after conferring with Mr. Gonzales, who Mr. Leahy said may be preoccupied on Tuesday with matters related to the shootings. The hearing is considered an all-important chance for Mr. Gonzales to answer questions and clear up confusion over the dismissals of the prosecutors, which Democrats and Republicans alike say were mishandled.

sports/olympics,USA Hockey Announces Rosters for the Olympics - The New York Times Without the ability to pick from a generation of young American stars, USA Hockey is leaning on a longtime N.H.L. winger as captain and hopes a diverse roster can capture an Olympic medal. At the Winter Classic in New York on Monday, Brian Gionta was named the Olympic men’s hockey captain as USA Hockey unveiled its roster for the Pyeongchang Olympics, the first games without N.H.L. players since 1994. There’s no Patrick Kane, Johnny Gaudreau, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel or Jonathan Quick, so the American men’s team is made up of Gionta, four college players, three from the American Hockey League and 15 playing in professional leagues across Europe. Denver’s Troy Terry, Boston University’s Jordan Greenway, St. Cloud State’s Will Borgen and Harvard’s Ryan Donato are the N.C.A.A. players. Terry and Greenway helped the U.S. win the world junior championship last year. “I get the opportunity to go over there and show everyone what I can do,” Greenway said. “I would have never been saying to myself I will probably be playing in the Olympics in my junior year of college.” This isn’t a ragtag bunch of college kids like the 1980 “Miracle On Ice,” the last time the U.S. men’s hockey team won the Olympic gold medal. The goal was to build a team of varying talents that could compete with the two-time defending champion Canada and favored Russia, so much of the roster is seasoned.
sports/olympics,With 1,006 games played over 15 seasons, Gionta, 38, has by far the most N.H.L. experience of the 23 players named. He put up 588 points for the Devils, the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres. He played for the U.S. at the 2006 Olympics and has been practicing with the A.H.L.’s Rochester Americans to stay in shape for Pyeongchang. “It’s one thing I don’t have, I haven’t been able to achieve, is an Olympic medal,” Gionta said. “I would love to end my career with something like that.” A total of 15 players on the roster have appeared in the N.H.L., including the A.H.L. star Chris Bourque and European-based forwards Mark Arcobello and Jim Slater and defensemen James Wisniewski and Bobby Sanguinetti. “I think it’s a great mix of young talent and veteran players with a lot of international experience,” said Sanguinetti, who was a first-round pick of the New York Rangers in 2006. “Excited to get together in a month.” Tony Granato, who played at the 1988 Olympics and now coaches at Wisconsin, will be behind the bench in South Korea. The Americans face Slovenia in its Olympic opener on Feb. 14. The U.S. lost the bronze medal game to Finland in 2014 and got the silver in Vancouver in 2010. But this is an entirely different dynamic with the N.H.L. choosing not to send players, as national federations couldn’t pick any player with an active N.H.L. contract. The initial U.S. roster includes five players from Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League, five from Switzerland’s National League A, three from the Swedish Hockey League and two from multiple levels of Germany’s Deutsche Eishockey Liga.
sports/olympics,Ryan Zapolski, who plays for Finnish-based Jokerit in the Kontinental Hockey League, is the only goaltender on the roster so far, with two more to be added later this month. The United States women’s hockey team will be led by captain Meghan Duggan, one of six two-time silver medalists, on a roster that features four other silver medalists from 2014. Forward Alex Carpenter and defenseman Megan Bozek are 2014 silver medalists who did not make the cut from the national team, which has been training since September in Florida. Joining Duggan on a third Olympic roster are Kacey Bellamy, Hilary Knight, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, Monique Lamoureux-Morando and Gigi Marvin. Kendall Coyne, Lee Stecklein, Brianna Decker and Amanda Kessel made their second Olympic team. The U.S. women open Olympic play Feb. 11 against Finland. Goalies: Ryan Zapolski (Jokerit, Kontinental Hockey League) Defensemen: Chad Billins (Linkoping, Swedish Hockey League); Jonathon Blum (Admiral Vladivostok, K.H.L.); Will Borgen (St. Cloud State); Matt Gilroy (Jokerit, K.H.L.); Ryan Gunderson (Brynas, S.H.L.); Bobby Sanguinetti (HC Lugano, Swiss National League); Noah Welch (Vaxjo Lakers, S.H.L.); James Wisniewski (Kassel Huskies, Deutsche Eishockey Liga) Forwards: Mark Arcobello (SC Bern, Swiss National League); Chris Bourque (Hershey Bears, American Hockey League); Bobby Butler (Milwaukee Admirals, A.H.L.); Ryan Donato (Harvard); Brian Gionta (unsigned); Jordan Greenway (Boston University); Chad Kolarik (Adler Mannheim, Deutsche Eishockey Liga); Broc Little (HC Davos, Swiss National League); John McCarthy (San Jose Barracuda, A.H.L.); Brian O’Neill (Jokerit, K.H.L.); Garrett Roe (EV Zug, Swiss National League); Jim Slater (Fribourg-Gotteron, Swiss National League); Ryan Stoa (Spartak Moscow, K.H.L.); Troy Terry (University of Denver)
sports/olympics,Goalies: Nicole Hensley (Lindenwood University); Alex Rigsby (Minnesota Whitecaps); Maddie Rooney (University of Minnesota-Duluth) Defenders: Cayla Barnes (Boston College); Kacey Bellamy (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L.); Kali Flanagan (Boston College); Megan Keller (Boston College); Sidney Morin (MODO Hockey, Sweden); Emily Pfalzer (Buffalo Beauts, N.W.H.L.); Lee Stecklein (University of Minnesota) Forwards: Hannah Brandt (Minnesota Whitecaps); Dani Cameranesi (University of Minnesota); Kendall Coyne (Minnesota Whitecaps); Brianna Decker (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L.); Meghan Duggan (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L); Amanda Kessel (New York Riveters, N.W.H.L.); Hilary Knight (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L.); Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson (Minnesota Whitecaps); Monique Lamoureux-Morando (Minnesota Whitecaps); Gigi Marvin (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L.); Kelly Pannek (University of Minnesota); Amanda Pelkey (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L.); Haley Skarupa (Boston Pride, N.W.H.L.)
science,A Quarter of the Country’s Green Sea Turtles Call Florida Refuge Home - The New York Times Green sea turtles have had their ups and downs. They were so plentiful that they were commercially harvested for hundreds of years in the Atlantic, but are now listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, depending on the location. They were one of the first species to be protected by regulations. That was in Bermuda in the 1600s. Apparently the effort didn’t work, however, as that local population was exterminated. These days, however, their numbers are increasing. In the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, just below Cape Canaveral, they are having a record year. Researchers and students at the University of Central Florida’s Marine Turtle Research Group counted 12,804 nests as of Thursday in the 13 miles of the refuge’s beaches that they monitor. That’s the first time the number has topped 12,000, said Kate Mansfield, who leads the group. That’s at least 25 percent of the green sea turtle nests in the United States, and the result will probably be more than 700,000 hatchlings emerging, Dr. Mansfield said. “It’s a pretty phenomenal sea turtle nesting spot,” she said. The research group has been monitoring the area for 35 years, dating back to before the refuge was established in 1991.
science,She emphasized that although the news was good for green turtles now, the turtles were a very long-lived species and long-term monitoring is essential. The turtles take 25 years to mature, and the ones making nests now were hatched around the time the refuge was established. They also benefit from the Endangered Species Act, she said, and from fishing regulations to decrease the accidental catch of sea turtles. The stretch of beach the university monitors also has more than 12,000 nests made by loggerhead turtles. At the height of the nesting season there, she said, 400 to 500 nests may be dug each night. If the turtle population keeps growing, it is going to be one crowded beach.
world/europe,Britain Appeals to Anti-Extremist Imams in Effort to Uproot Seeds of Radicalization - The New York Times COVENTRY, England —  The beheading of American journalist James Foley, apparently by a British jihadist, has drawn renewed attention to the dangers posed by radicalized young British Muslims. The government estimates that 500 or more British men and women have gone to fight for militant groups in Iraq and Syria, some of whom have already returned. Britain monitors its citizens on social media sites as part of its counterterrorism strategy. But the government has also turned to anti-extremist imams for help to prevent British Muslims from adopting radical views and to persuade those who have returned from the battlefields to moderate their beliefs. After the killing of Mr. Foley, Qari Asim, the imam of the Makkah mosque in Leeds, urged Muslims “to work with the intelligence services and the government to make sure that this poison doesn’t reach our borders.” Speaking to the BBC, he said that the risk of British Muslims joining the extremist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was increasing because of Britain’s involvement in Iraq. Mohammed Hadi, 18, sneaked out of his house in Coventry one morning in March and, like scores of British Muslims before him, went to fight for a militant group in Syria. His parents were shocked and confused.
world/europe,“He was normal at home, a moderate Muslim,” his father, Mahir Hadi, said in an interview. After three months without a trace, Mohammed began posting messages on Twitter in June. He had taken an Islamic name, Abu Yahya al-Kurdy, and claimed that he had joined ISIS. His mother told a newspaper, The Sun, that Mohammed received very little pocket money, suggesting that someone else paid for his plane ticket. The only clue to his son’s sudden departure, Mr. Hadi said, was the local imam, Mohammed Shoaib, who had taught the young man at his madrasa and, according to a person who knows the family, accompanied him on a trip to Turkey near the border with Syria, without his parents’ knowledge. Mr. Hadi said he suspected that the imam had radicalized his son, so he confronted him. According to Mr. Hadi, Mr. Shoaib denied the claims. The imam has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and he declined a request for an interview. “Of course I have my suspicions,” Mr. Hadi said. “But there’s no proof. What can you do?” Only a minority of religious leaders plant the seeds of radicalization, experts and officials say. The intended audience is disaffected youth, alienated from local mosques and searching for answers about the typical concerns of young people, as well as the conflicts in the Middle East.
world/europe,Those imams often preach a brand of Islamic supremacy, the experts say, that demonizes non-Muslims and gays and justifies militant acts with extreme interpretations of the Quran. They are careful not to suggest taking up arms, but will talk about the situation in Syria, Iraq or Gaza, and then talk about a Muslim’s duties. Their views are extreme, but rarely illegal. Radicalization is heightened by views found on the Internet and social media, and in small lectures and workshops outside the mosque. “You don’t go online looking for a pair of shoes to buy and suddenly end up becoming a jihadi,” said Haras Rafiq, a former member of the government’s counterextremism task force and now with the Quilliam Foundation, a research group that studies and tackles religious extremism. A Cardiff mosque attracted attention in June when it was reported that three young men who joined ISIS were regular attendees. The mosque, Al-Manar Centre, insists that the men were radicalized by information picked up on the Internet, not at the mosque. But in March, the Home Office barred one of its preachers, Sheikh Mohammed al-Arifi, a Saudi, from entering the country, calling him a “threat to society.” The Al-Manar Centre has also occasionally invited speakers from the Islamic Education and Research Academy, which aims to convert people to Islam. Its members have in the past said that gay men, apostates and Jews deserve to be killed.
world/europe,“There are some mosques that are of particular interest to us,” said Peter Fahy, chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police, who leads the government’s strategy to prevent people from embracing extremism. “But a lot of these people are not stupid,” he said, referring to radical preachers, “and are pretty careful in terms of the way they stay just on the right side of the line” of hate speech and encouraging terrorism. Part of the problem is that not enough imams challenge extremist narratives that captivate vulnerable youth, said Timothy Winter, dean of Cambridge Muslim College, which trains about 100 imams a year. Most imams avoid preaching on divisive political and social issues, he said, and, “They can’t spend quality time every day with every young angry man.” The role of the government is limited, he said, because it lacks “the competence of the traditional scholars,” and not all who take part in deradicalization efforts are linked to the government. “You could compare it to exit counseling in cults,” said Mr. Winter. “It can take weeks. It works, but it’s extraordinarily labor-intensive.” One imam who works with the government, and asked for anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue, described a boy, 16, who was angry about the Afghan war. He told the imam that he planned to poison the water supply of an army barracks near London. “This young boy was very upset and was quite ready,” the imam said. He spent days talking with him, and at one point, grabbed him and yelled, “What is the matter with you? Are you crazy?” In the end the boy abandoned his plan, he said. “He’s gone back to normality.”
world/europe,More recently, the imam has worked with youngsters back from Syria. Not all are militants and can be “mentored out of radicalization,” he said, but many have difficult family situations or psychological disorders. Another imam, Muhammad Manwar Ali, who runs a charitable education center in Ipswich, tries to help young men understand the complexity of politics and the Middle Eastern conflicts. But he is careful not to insult the idea of jihad. “It’s chivalrous, you want to sacrifice your life for a noble ideal,” he said. “But I say it has to be done in a responsible way. And God is not what you conceive him to be: an angry, vengeful god.” The young men, while often impatient, listen, he said, because of his own history. Mr. Ali, 54, said that for 20 years he had recruited and trained fighters, and fought, himself, in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmir, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. His friendship with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric who worked with Al Qaeda in Yemen before he was killed, impresses his listeners. But he quit jihadism in 2000, he said, after long reflection and the loss of 20 friends in combat. “Certain things impact you,” he said. “You begin to ignore things less, you dare to listen, dare to open up.” Men in their 30s and 40s resist persuasion, he said, but his work with younger Muslims often pays off. And many who return, scarred from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, are “already fed up and want to settle back into normal life.”
world/europe,Mr. Hadi, Mohammed’s father, said he was hopeful. “I’m still waiting for my son to come back home,” he said.
fashion,Leslie Jones’s Twitter Makes Her the De Facto Olympics Fashion Critic (Again) - The New York Times Laura Kumin was watching the Winter Olympics on Sunday night when the Italian figurer skater Matteo Rizzo appeared on the ice in a black jumpsuit with gold braiding across his chest. “I was thinking, ‘Oh my God. What about that outfit?’” she said. As she often does while watching television, she checked Twitter and saw that Leslie Jones, the “Saturday Night Live” star who is live tweeting the Olympics for NBC, had the same reaction. Ms. Jones has emerged as the Olympics’ anti-announcer, funny and often salty, especially when it comes to the fashion, which, at its best, can be daring, and, its worst, well, she has her views. “He looks like the Nutcracker,” Ms. Jones said of Mr. Rizzo in her spoken commentary, which often accompanies the phone video clips of the NBC broadcast. “I don’t like it.” Nothing escapes her sharp eye: not black gloves, not a skating pair in checkers (“I don’t even really know how to express the hate that I have”), not even her and Johnny Weir’s matching hairstyles. And she does it all while watching from home on her television and, sometimes, her laptop too. “She’s not a fashion expert, and she is not holding herself out to be,” said Melissa Rivers, the former host of E’s “Fashion Police.” “She takes all the haughtiness out of it.”
fashion,It was Ms. Rivers’s mother, Joan, who effectively created a genre of comedians commenting on fashion, with her scathing reviews of Hollywood glitterati. But unlike when the elder Ms. Rivers was alive, when the commentary would follow the event, the fashion curious now expect their commentary (and comedy) simultaneously. When Ms. Jones wondered aloud why some skating outfits seemed better than others last weekend, her followers chimed in right away, explaining the difference between ice dancing and figure skating. This, of course, is not Ms. Jones’s first time sharing Olympic gold with sports fans. In August 2016, Mike Shoemaker, a former producer for “Saturday Night Live” who works with Seth Meyers, saw her tweets and told Jim Bell, now the president of NBC Olympics Production and Programming. (In one tweet, Ms. Jones was dressed as superfan in a red, white and blue costume.) She was hired to go to Rio de Janeiro to work on NBC’s coverage of the Summer Olympics. For some, Ms. Jones’s account is how they watch the Olympics. John Moss, a business technology specialist in Atlanta, said he began following Ms. Jones on Twitter six months ago. When he does not have time to watch the Olympics, he checks in with her. “I experience the Olympics through her,” he said. On Sunday, she tweeted about the fit of an skater’s suspenders. Mr. Moss had issues with her fashion take. (“Suspenders rock,” he commented.) “I thought, What is wrong with suspenders?” he said. “I wear suspenders.” He agreed, though, about her assessment of a snowboarder whose pants were bunched around his knees. “That didn’t seem right,” he said.
fashion,Ms. Jones is headed to Pyeongchang, South Korea, in a few days for NBC. There she will be a contributor, according to the network, and attend Olympic events, meet and interview athletes, and continue to tweet. Her followers wouldn’t want it any other way.

us,A Struggle for Common Ground, Amid Fears of a National Fracture - The New York Times Long after her two sons were in bed, Shanel Berry kept vigil in front of the television at her home in Waterloo, Iowa, watching the week’s horror unfurl and obsessing over a single question: Was the gunman who killed five Dallas police officers black? “I just thought, ‘Please, please don’t let him be black,’” because if he was, she worried that police shootings of black men could become easy to justify. Ms. Berry, an elementary-school teacher, said she hurt for the officers and their families. But when the gunman was identified and his photo flashed on the screen, she sank even lower. “I told my boys, ‘Now, this will make it even harder.’” Fifteen hundred miles away, David Moody, a retired Las Vegas police officer, woke on Friday morning to fellow officers writing messages of anger and condolence on their Facebook pages, posting black-clad badges in solidarity with the Dallas Police Department. He had seethed at what he called the anti-police sentiment of protests over the deaths of two black men fatally shot by the police in Louisiana and Minnesota. And now this. “The atmosphere that’s out there right now,” he said. “We don’t get up in the morning thinking how can we violate somebody’s rights today, how can we pick on this type of person. Every guy I know that’s out there working is getting up every day and thinking he’s going to make a difference.”
us,Even as political leaders, protesters and law enforcement officials struggled to find common ground and lit candles of shared grief, there was an inescapable fear that the United States was being pulled further apart in its anger and anguish over back-to-back fatal shootings by police officers followed by a sniper attack by a military veteran who said he wanted to kill white police officers. Just days after the United States celebrated its 240th birthday, people in interviews across the country said that the nation increasingly felt mired in bloodshed and blame, and that despite pleas for compassion and unity, it was fracturing along racial and ideological lines into angry camps of liberals against conservatives, Black Lives Matter against Blue Lives Matter, protesters against the police. Whose side were you on? Which victims did you mourn? In a televised interview, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations blamed President Obama for waging a “war on cops.” On social media, others confronted the discrepancies in the everyday lives of black and white Americans, hoping understanding would lead to conversations and action. Along the Las Vegas Strip, a sunbaked cross-section of races, backgrounds and political views, tourists and workers said the relentless parade of violence during the week had left them mostly in shock and disbelief. They worried that more would follow.
us,Police departments across the country took precautions, ordering officers to double up in their patrol cruisers and to work in pairs or teams. Civilians were also on guard. Trey Jemmott, an incoming freshman at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said his mother warned him to be careful before he left for the gym the other night. “She always told me, being an African-American, you already have strikes against you,” he said. “I just feel like something’s got to change. We thought we were over this.” At an outdoor food stand on the Strip, three co-workers — black, white and Asian — debated whether the bloodshed would lead to healing or deeper divisions as they talked about their own experiences with the police. Martin Clemons, 28, said he and other black friends had been frisked for jaywalking across the Strip. Zach Luciano, 23, who is white, said he had never been stopped or had a negative run-in with law enforcement, and had considered becoming a police officer. “There’s more good cops than bad cops,” Mr. Luciano said. “I wanted to be one of those good ones.” What the three co-workers shared was a grim view that the country’s divides would not heal anytime soon. “It’s sad, but this is what the world’s coming to,” Mr. Luciano said. In New York, Monifa Bandele has spent the past 17 years working to get citizens to video record police interactions, yet as the Facebook Live recording of Philando Castile’s shooting in Minnesota coursed across social media on Wednesday night, she could not bring herself to watch.
us,“I literally thought I would have a stroke. I could feel my blood pressure going up,” said Ms. Bandele, 45, a Brooklyn native. “I work day and night to end police brutality, and no matter how much responsibility I felt, I just couldn’t do it.” Ms. Bandele and her husband, Lumumba, helped found Copwatch after the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo in a hail of bullets fired by New York City police officers who mistook a wallet in his hand for a gun. She is frequently called upon to comment on police killings, and so watching these videos is part of her work. The night before the Castile video posted, Ms. Bandele had to watch the recording of a police officer in Baton Rouge, La., shooting Alton Sterling as he lay pinned to the ground. But the back-to-back videos, after what has felt like a constant cycle of videos of police killings of black Americans, proved too much. “It was just a breaking. I have spoken to people who are broken, and they just can’t take any more,” Ms. Bandele said. “Those images visit me at night. The impact is emotional and it is physical.” Instead, she rushed upstairs to try to take the phones of her two teenage daughters before they could watch the video. But her oldest, Naima, 17, met her on the stairs, distraught, her eyes filled with tears. Ms. Bandele had to take off from work Friday to comfort her girls, to help them deal with the pain they were feeling.
us,Mr. Moody, the retired Las Vegas officer who also is the president of the Las Vegas Fraternal Order of Police, represents the reverse side that vigilance. He said he spent much of his career patrolling the city on motorcycle, and now, when he comes across a traffic stop or a police cruiser flashing its lights, he pauses to watch out for the officers. “You need citizens out there doing this kind of stuff,” Mr. Moody said, “because you never know what’s going to happen.” Ms. Berry, the teacher in Iowa, said she worked hard to raise her two boys, Dallas, 15, and Amari, 11, to make a good impression. Square your shoulders, she has always told them, look people in the eyes when they talk to you, and stand up for what is right. But that advice comes with a painful exception: Do none of these things if stopped by the police. “That is the hurting part,” said Ms. Berry, 37. “Because that is the part that Dallas doesn’t quite get. ‘Why are you telling me to comply if I am not doing anything wrong?’ I am trying to teach them to be men and stand up for themselves, but at the same time I am telling them to back down and not be who they are.” This past week has only made that tightrope walk all the more difficult, trying to balance protecting her children’s innocence with preparing them for what feels like an eventuality.

world/americas,René Préval, President of Haiti in 2010 Quake, Dies at 74 - The New York Times René Préval, the former president of Haiti who led his nation out of turmoil after a coup but stumbled through the trauma of the deadliest natural disaster ever recorded in the Americas, the earthquake of 2010, died on Friday at his home in Port-au-Prince. He was 74. The current president, Jovenel Moïse, confirmed the death in a Twitter message on Friday. The cause was not immediately known. Mr. Préval was the first — and so far only — Haitian president to be elected, serve out his term and hand over power to an elected successor, an extraordinary accomplishment in a fragile democracy besieged by decades of turmoil. And he did it twice, serving from 1996 to 2001 and again from 2006 until 2011. A man of quiet demeanor in a country with a politically raucous history, he was best known for what did not happen to him: He was neither assassinated nor overthrown. Indeed, he was regarded as a pragmatic consensus builder. But his reputation was severely bruised after the earthquake, which killed an estimated 100,000 to 316,000 people. He was roundly criticized for not reassuring his stunned nation that help was on the way, either from other nations or his own battered government. “As a person, I was paralyzed,” Mr. Préval told The Los Angeles Times that year. “I was much criticized for not having spoken.”
world/americas,But he added: “To say what? To the thousands of parents whose children were dead. To the hundreds of schoolchildren I was hearing scream, ‘Come help me!’ I couldn’t find the words to say to those people.” René Garcia Préval was born on Jan. 17, 1943, in Port-au-Prince and raised in Marmelade, a town in a mountainous coffee and rice-growing region of north-central Haiti. His father, Claude Jules Préval, was an agronomist and a government official until the family was forced to scatter under the dictatorship of François Duvalier, known as Papa Doc. Mr. Préval went to Belgium, where he followed in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps and studied agronomy at the Gembloux Agricultural University. He later studied geothermal science at the University of Pisa in Italy. In 1970, Mr. Préval moved to Brooklyn, where he worked as a waiter and messenger. He returned to Haiti in 1975. By then it was under the less openly violent, though still authoritarian, rule of Mr. Duvalier’s son, Jean-Claude, known as Baby Doc. Mr. Préval worked in low-level government positions, including in the agency overseeing mining. In 1988, two years after Baby Doc was ousted, Mr. Préval opened a bakery that provided bread to poor children in Port-au-Prince’s slums, including in an orphanage run by the charismatic Roman Catholic priest and political activist Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The bakery would change the direction of Mr. Préval’s life. He and Father Aristide became friends, and Mr. Préval rose in prominence in Father Aristide’s Lavalas movement, which was popular with Haiti’s quickly growing urban poor and fiercely opposed by the country’s tiny ruling elite.
world/americas,After Mr. Aristide became president in 1990, having left the priesthood, he appointed Mr. Préval as his prime minister, placing him in charge of the government’s operations. But the Aristide government lasted only a few months before it was overthrown by the military. The two went into exile. Mr. Préval later returned and was elected president, but he did not have the charisma of his political benefactor, and Mr. Aristide was considered the true power behind his presidency. When peasants asked how they could survive under United States trade policies and soaring fuel prices, he notoriously told them to “swim their way out.” Mr. Préval organized new elections in 2000 that returned Mr. Aristide to power. The ensuing inauguration was a Haitian milestone: Mr. Préval became the first Haitian leader to be freely elected, serve a full constitutional term and then peacefully hand power to a successor. But Mr. Aristide’s term was cut short again in a bloody 2004 coup. Mr. Préval was elected again two years later. Mr. Préval, whose first two marriages ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, Elisabeth Delatour Préval, two daughters, Patricia and Dominique, and two stepsons. It was in his second term that Mr. Préval escaped Mr. Aristide’s shadow and emerged as a force of his own. After breaking with Mr. Aristide, he used his quiet manner and diplomatic charm to encourage the soft support of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.
world/americas,Mr. Préval was never one to stir up the masses with oratory flair, or one to bother stumping on the campaign trail. When the earthquake — 7.0 magnitude — toppled the capital on Jan. 12, 2010, Mr. Préval did not emerge in public for hours. Reporters later learned that he had spent the night anonymously touring the devastation on the back of a motorcycle. Close associates described him as falling into a state of shock from which he never fully recovered. Jocelerme Privert, a former provisional president who was a member of Mr. Préval’s cabinet and a longtime friend, said Mr. Préval was known for daily 8 a.m. cabinet meetings that actually began on time. He patiently listened to each cabinet member and made decisions by consensus, Mr. Privert said. “He is not a demagogue, I can say that,” Mr. Privert said by telephone on Friday from Port-au-Prince. “He always believed: If you have to build a bridge, build it. Don’t announce it.”
world/asia,China to Raise Military Spending, but Less Than in Recent Years - The New York Times BEIJING — China said Saturday that its military budget would rise by about 7 percent this year, apparently the lowest increase in seven years, signaling that its leaders do not plan to engage the United States in an arms race even as President Trump seeks to bolster the Pentagon’s spending. Addressing reporters before the start of the annual National People’s Congress, Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for the legislature, said the increase would be “about” 7 percent. She said defense spending would amount to roughly 1.3 percent of China’s gross domestic product. Last year’s proposed increase was 7.6 percent, though China has yet to release final figures indicating how much was actually spent. Those figures, and the exact number of this year’s projected increase, will be revealed in a budget that the government releases on Sunday, when the national legislature starts its annual full session. Before 2016, the military budget had received double-digit increases for six years, a reflection of China’s then-roaring economy. Chinese experts said the new budget would keep military spending roughly in line with the government’s usual formula of G.D.P. growth plus inflation. As China’s economy continues to slow, annual growth in the gross domestic product is expected to be about 6.5 percent. Inflation hovers around 2 percent. And the government must also find more money for health care, education and other increasingly expensive social needs.
world/asia,Chinese and Western military analysts said it was notable that Mr. Trump’s recent pledge to raise American defense spending by $54 billion had not spurred China to elevate its own spending further. Ms. Fu said that China wanted good relations with the Trump administration but would respond to any challenges. “President Xi Jinping and President Trump have had two direct phone calls, and the message was very clear, which is that there must be more cooperation between China and the United States so we become good partners,” Ms. Fu said. But she added that China would watch the effects of Mr. Trump’s global policy changes. “Of course, everyone hopes that their impact will be positive, but if there are challenges, China will respond calmly,” Ms. Fu said. The U.S. military is vastly more powerful than China’s, as Ms. Fu noted. “Fundamentally, this is about the United States worrying that China could catch up and surpass the U.S. in its ability,” she said. “But in fact there is a still a huge gap in ability between the U.S. and China, which is still a developing country.” To emphasize his intent to strengthen the American military, Mr. Trump visited the country’s new aircraft carrier this week. The Gerald R. Ford is a nuclear-powered, 100,000-ton floating fortress due to be commissioned this year and is the first in a new generation of supercarriers. The United States has 10 Nimitz-class supercarriers. In contrast, China is building its first aircraft carrier, a diesel-propelled vessel, and has one refurbished carrier from Ukraine.
world/asia,Wang Xiangsui, a retired senior colonel in China’s Air Force who is now director of the Research Center of Strategic Issues at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said Mr. Trump’s plans to increase military spending were unlikely to prod China into following suit. “I don’t think China will be oversensitive about this,” he said. “Despite all the aggressive talk, no one wants a war,” Mr. Wang said. While the $54 billion increase sounds like a lot, he added, "the Americans didn’t achieve anything after spending six trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan.” China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, who visited Washington this week and met briefly with Mr. Trump at the White House, probably had the military budget on his mind as he tried to judge the mood of the new administration, said Dennis J. Blasko, an American expert on the Chinese military. “I’m guessing Yang Jiechi was tasked to make an assessment of the state of the bilateral relationship to see if there may need to be a last-minute adjustment in reaction to the requested increase for the U.S. defense budget,” said Mr. Blasko, a retired army lieutenant colonel and the author of “The Chinese Army Today.” Mr. Yang probably found the relationship to be on a sound enough footing, Mr. Blasko said. “I don’t think they want to get into a military budget fight with us, not even a rhetorical one.” Ni Lexiong, a naval expert in Shanghai, said that if China really felt the need to spend more heavily on the military, it would not hesitate to do so.
world/asia,“If China felt threatened, I don’t think slower economic growth would stop them from spending more on the military,” Mr. Ni said. “You have seen how the Chinese were willing to starve to build an atomic bomb. We do not worry about poverty when we think a larger military is necessary.” He said the new budget would allow China to keep modernizing its navy and air force, the two services currently getting the most attention. The navy launched 22 warships in 2016 to replace old ones, and the budget would let it keep up that pace this year, he said. “A chunk of the expenditure will go towards developing and manufacturing the latest weapons for a stronger air force and navy,” he said. “I believe this speed of replacement will continue, because it has been one of China’s long-term growth goals to build a military stronger than America’s one day, in either quality or quantity.” While China’s future aircraft carriers are likely to be nuclear powered, the Chinese Navy will probably be focused on other, more important areas, said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. “Chinese submarine development and the building of destroyers and frigates are likely more expensive and more consequential for the overall military balance,” he said. If Mr. Trump were to win his proposed increase of $54 billion, the American defense budget would be $603 billion, about 3 percent higher than under former President Barack Obama’s last budget plan.
world/asia,The People’s Liberation Army’s official budget was about $146 billion in 2016. Western groups that study the Chinese military say that actual spending is roughly 1.2 to 1.5 times greater than the announced figures. Using a rough estimate that assumes an average G.D.P. growth in China of 6.5 percent and a U.S. growth rate of 3 percent, China’s military spending would be expected to surpass America’s around 2040, said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Among the issues that Chinese military planners must deal with is how to handle the retrenchment of 300,000 personnel announced by President Xi Jinping in 2015, part of an effort to streamline the P.L.A. into a modern fighting force. Although most of those leaving the army are mid- to low-level officers and soldiers, the severance costs are expected to be substantial, retired Chinese officers said.

us,As Wind Power Lifts Wyoming’s Fortunes, Coal Miners Are Left in the Dust - The New York Times GILLETTE, Wyo. — After Kullin Orcutt lost his job at the Peabody coal mine this spring, he knew what he needed to do: join the exodus. “Leave Gillette, leave the state,” he said. Mr. Orcutt is a third-generation miner and one of 592 coal workers who have been laid off here since January. Thousands more job cuts are expected this summer. More people will follow Mr. Orcutt. While many businesses in Gillette are struggling to stay open, a U-Haul dealer has been nearly sold out since the school year ended this month. But 200 miles to the southwest, in Carbon County, where Wyoming’s first coal mine opened a century ago, the mood is different. The last coal mine closed a decade ago, but the county may soon be home to the largest wind farm in North America, if not the world. “Coal is hurting, but wind power is our bright spot on the horizon,” said Cindy Wallace, the director of the Carbon County Economic Development Corporation. “Eventually, we could be the wind capital of Wyoming, the U.S., the world.” In Wyoming, the country’s biggest coal-producing state, the energy landscape is transforming along with the nation’s, but in a state of 584,000 people, that change is happening at hyperspeed. That transition has left men like Mr. Orcutt behind. The new positions and financial opportunities offered by wind and other new-energy industries are not replacing all the jobs going up in coal smoke.
us,Many of the current jobs are out of state, at wind turbine factories in Colorado and Iowa. Millions of dollars’ worth of out-of-state investments are flowing into Wyoming’s wind projects, but much of the profit will flow out of state, as well. The thousands of coal workers who will probably lose their jobs do not necessarily have the technical skills to operate wind farms. In any case, new wind jobs will number in the hundreds, not the thousands. So when Mr. Orcutt left Gillette this spring, he did not head for the wind fields of Carbon County. Instead, he moved to Shelby, Mont., for a job at a privately run prison, leaving behind his wife and son in a groaning two-bedroom apartment that they share with Mr. Orcutt’s sister, her husband — a welder who was laid off from the coal mines — and that couple’s three children. “It’s hard being here without them, but here I have a job,” he said. “In Gillette, those jobs are gone forever.” The numbers bear out his decision, said Robert W. Godby, an energy economist and professor at the University of Wyoming. “Wind energy is certainly lucrative,” he said. “That’s why so many investors are interested. But it doesn’t create nearly the economic impact of the fossil fuel industry.” Today, about 66 percent of the electricity in the United States is produced by coal and natural gas, and just 7 percent is produced by renewable sources such as wind and solar. But market forces and government regulations are rapidly changing that picture.
us,A glut of inexpensive natural gas has cut into coal’s dominance of America’s power market. And President Obama’s climate change regulations, known as the Clean Power Plan, take direct aim at coal, the No. 1 cause of planet-warming greenhouse gases. The Department of the Interior has already declared a halt on new coal mining on public lands, a move with an outsize impact on Wyoming, where a majority of mines are on federal property. And the international Paris agreement on climate change could make the efforts to end the burning of coal a global campaign. All of these policies are closing the remaining coal-fired plants and freezing the construction of new ones, but they also aim to aggressively increase the production of renewable power. The Clean Power Plan contains a goal for 20 percent of the nation’s electricity to come from wind, solar and other clean sources by 2030. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to raise that amount to 33 percent by 2027. Companies from around the world are looking to Wyoming’s wind to meet that demand. “There’s enough wind in Wyoming to power the entire country,” said Michael Goggin, the senior director of research at the American Wind Energy Association. Wyoming’s Republican governor, Matt Mead, is skeptical of human-caused climate change, and has been an outspoken opponent of Mr. Obama’s climate change agenda. Still, he also sees economic opportunity in  wind power.
us,“We’ve been a dig-and-ship state, exporting energy to the rest of the country,” Mr. Mead said in an interview in his office. “With the advances in wind turbines, why shouldn’t we be leading that at the University of Wyoming? Why don’t we do more to bring wind manufacturing to the state?” Perhaps the biggest winner in Wyoming’s wind boom will be one man: Philip F. Anschutz, a Colorado billionaire and major Republican donor. His company, the Anschutz Corporation, is building the Carbon County wind farm on 2,000 acres owned by Mr. Anschutz and the federal government. When completed, the site will be the largest wind power producer in North America, generating enough electricity to light a million homes — far more than Wyoming needs. Mr. Anschutz is also planning to build the TransWest Express, a 730-mile power line that would take Wyoming’s wind energy to Las Vegas and California. Construction on both projects is expected to begin late this year or early 2017. On a recent day, Bill Miller, senior vice president of energy and land resources for the Anschutz Corporation, drove his truck through the Carbon County site’s rocky mesas, which channel near-constant wind across the green plain. The only visible inhabitants were cows, antelopes, prairie dogs and rattlesnakes. Although wind power has traditionally been more expensive than fossil fuels, Mr. Miller said the Anschutz wind project will be large enough to make wind as cheap, if not cheaper, than coal power.
us,“We can produce wind power here that’s competitive with anything: coal, natural gas,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Miller estimates that the construction of the wind farm will create about 900 seasonal jobs over the decade it will take to build it, and about 150 full-time jobs to operate and maintain it. In the nearby town of Rawlins, he said, a branch of Western Wyoming Community College has already started programs to train wind power technicians. “You’ll be able to take a coal miner from Gillette — he can go to the community college here for the skills, and get a job as a wind technician,” Mr. Miller said. But, he conceded, “Am I going to replace 800 lost coal jobs in Gillette with new wind jobs? No.” Another big winner in the Wyoming wind boom may be a Venezuelan company, Viridis Eolia Corporation, which also plans to build a large-scale wind farm near Carbon County, one second in size in North America only to the Anschutz project. “It’s the wave of the future,” Juan Carlos Carpio Delfino, Viridis Eolia’s chief executive, said at an energy conference at Little America, a golf resort outside Cheyenne. “With Obama’s clean power regulations, and the signing of the Paris agreement, it creates a stable market for wind — and this is the best wind in North America.” That remains cold comfort to Wyoming’s coal community. Mr. Godby estimates that in the coming years, Wyoming could lose up to 10,000 jobs related to the coal industry.
us,Last month, officials from the Interior Department held a public hearing in Casper to gather input on the current halt on new coal mining on the state’s public lands. During the meeting, Jillian Balow, the Wyoming superintendent of public instruction, spoke before a crowd of hundreds, her voice cracking. “We have reached the point where the restrictions and regulations for the industry are past our ability to adapt,” she said. “It has put thousands of hard-working people out of work and is devastating families.” “Give us a chance,” she pleaded.
science,PERSONAL HEALTH; For the Vaccine-Wary, a Lesson in History - The New York Times Most parents now raising questions about the safety and wisdom of childhood immunizations have never seen a case of whooping cough, polio, measles or mumps. Parents now in their 20's and 30's grew up in an era when they and all their schoolmates were protected against such serious infections by a series of vaccinations administered early in life. Few such parents realize that small children can die or become brain-damaged from a measles infection. They do not remember when children were forbidden to swim in public pools all summer so they would not contract polio. Nor have they seen children placed in iron lungs because polio had crippled their respiratory muscles. As a 59-year-old, I have a clear recollection of these unfortunate events. I also clearly recall my own experience with horrific cases of chickenpox (scarred for more than a decade), measles and mumps on both sides of my face simultaneously. And I can still hear the whooping coughs of a childhood friend who developed pertussis and had to be hospitalized in isolation. Ill-informed hysteria about the safety of current vaccines could once more bring these awful childhood diseases to the fore. To be sure, most parents who now resist childhood immunizations are well intentioned. They are only trying to protect their children from purported serious side effects that have been bandied about in print, on the air, on the floor of Congress and now on the Internet. The Internet also offers guidance on how parents can skirt the immunization requirements for entering school.
science,How accurate are the accusations against vaccines, and what price might we pay for heeding them at the expense of the immunizations now universally recommended by pediatric and public health officials? A pro-vaccine Web site, www.Pkids.org, offers some cautionary statistics regarding failure to immunize. Before Vaccines When I was a child, 13,000 to 20,000 cases of paralytic polio were reported in this country every year. Now there are none. Before children were routinely immunized against measles, nearly every American child got it -- three million to four million cases, resulting in some cases of measles encephalitis and an average of 450 deaths a year. The vaccine reduced measles cases by more than 95 percent. But as has been made clear from outbreaks of measles that have occurred where rates of childhood immunization were low, the scourge of measles can return quickly and easily. Whooping cough (pertussis), too, was nearly a universal occurrence of childhood that killed 5 of every 1,000 children born in this country before pertussis immunizations. From 150,000 to 260,000 cases were reported each year, with up to 9,000 pertussis-related deaths. In the 1970's, the British showed what could happen when pertussis vaccination rates dropped. After questions were raised about the safety of the vaccine then in use, immunization rates dropped to 60 percent in Britain and in the next few years, a series of pertussis epidemics occurred, including one resulting in more than 100,000 cases and 36 deaths. And in Japan, by 1979 pertussis vaccination coverage dropped to 20 percent from 80 percent, leading to more than 13,000 cases and 41 deaths.
science,Before we had a vaccine for Haemophilis influenza type b (Hib), 20,000 infants and children each year developed invasive Hib infections, two-thirds of which resulted in meningitis, a disease that killed 600 children each year and left many others with seizures, complete hearing loss or mental retardation. The vaccine, introduced in 1987, has resulted in a decline in Hib of more than 97 percent, to only 33 cases last year. Parents who refuse to have their children vaccinated are basically counting on the fact that most children are immunized, conferring a kind of herd immunity. But as a serious outbreak of measles in Alaska shows, all it takes is one child with an active infection to cause widespread problems among those not properly immunized. Last spring, in a Washington Post editorial, Dr. Julian Orenstein, a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics who practices emergency medicine in Fairfax, Va., warned colleagues to ''bone up'' about infectious diseases that they thought had disappeared: measles, mumps, whooping cough.  ''They may return,'' he said, because ''some parents have stopped trusting the vaccinations that kept those illnesses at bay.'' Safety Concerns Answered The concerns of parents, and some medical professionals, have not gone unheeded. Although follow-up studies did not support British fears that brain damage or sudden infant death could occur in rare cases after pertussis inoculations, a new vaccine was developed that lacked the potential for such an effect. While the old vaccine was based on whole cells, the new one is acellular, made from only part of the infectious organism. The new vaccine is associated with fewer minor side effects, yet it appears to be as effective as the whole-cell vaccine in preventing whooping cough.
science,The switch from the original injected Salk polio vaccine to the oral Sabin vaccine resulted in rare but serious cases of vaccine-related paralytic polio. From 1980 to 1994, 124 American cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio were reported. The Salk vaccine was made from inactivated viruses that could not cause disease. The Sabin vaccine, though easier to use and highly effective, was made from live attenuated viruses, some of which apparently retained their infectious potential. The current recommendation for healthy children is administration of four doses of the inactivated Salk vaccine -- at 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years. The resulting immunity is as good as with the Sabin vaccine, but the risk of vaccine-induced polio is nonexistent. With regard to measles vaccine, which is given along with vaccines for mumps and rubella, no change has been made in either the vaccine itself or its recommended administration schedule. Yet some parents suspect that the vaccine or the combination of the three vaccines (M.M.R.), or some other vaccine combination, is responsible for a rise in autism cases among infants and toddlers. Studies have found no causal connection between the vaccines and autism. Rather, the autism cases seem to be coincidental with immunizations and their rise could simply be a result of better recognition and diagnosis. Also, though perhaps not noticed by parents or their pediatricians, symptoms of autism are usually present at birth whereas the three-part M.M.R. vaccine is administered at 12 to 15 months of age.
science,Keep a Record A study conducted in the early 1990's by researchers at the University of Chicago Children's Hospital revealed that parents could not be relied upon to give health professionals an accurate history of their children's immunizations. The main problem occurs because parents fail to keep a vaccination card recording vaccines and the dates they are given, relying instead on doctors to keep such a record. But when families move or switch doctors, the records become incomplete or misplaced. At every well-child visit, the immunization card should be brought to the doctor's office or clinic and the vaccines recorded. Likewise, this card should be taken along if the child goes to a hospital or emergency room for any reason.

sports/basketball,Is LeBron James, at 33, Better Than He Was 5 Years Ago? - The New York Times LeBron James turns 33 on Saturday, and you don’t need advanced statistics to tell you that he is still playing amazingly. Coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors went a bit further this week: “How many players are better in Year 15 than in Year 10? ... Go down the list: Michael, Bird, Magic, Wilt, Kareem, Bill Russell. A lot of them didn’t even get to 15 years. Were any of them better in Year 15 than in Year 10? I can’t imagine.” Athletes in most sports peak in their late 20s. But could Kerr’s contention be true? Could James actually be playing better at 33 than at 28? Certainly James’s 15th year ranks at the very top among players so deep into their careers. James’s average of 27.8 points per game is the highest of any player in Year 15, surpassing Karl Malone’s 1999-00 season and Kobe Bryant in 2010-11. It helps that James, like Bryant, started early, coming into the league straight from high school. It is better to be 33 during your 15th season than 35 or 37. But even comparing him to those his own age, he comes out well. Of players at age 33, James’s 27.8 points a game would rank fifth all time, according to Basketball-Reference, behind Dominique Wilkins, Michael Jordan, Alex English and Bryant.
sports/basketball,Even compared to his younger competitors, James ranks near the top this year. He leads the league in field goals, is second in points to James Harden and, defying his age, is second in minutes played, behind 22-year-old Andrew Wiggins. But saying he is actually better than five years ago is a stretch. James’s career numbers show incredible consistency and longevity, though not necessarily improvement. Year after year, without fail, he has scored 25 to 30 points a game and pulled down six to eight rebounds. The two statistics that really jump out in the last few years are 3-point shooting and assists. Like many N.B.A. players, James has shot more from beyond the 3-point arc recently, and is set to average two made 3s a game this season for the first time. In return, he has cut back on taking long 2-point shots: Just 11 percent of his shots this season are 2s of more than 16 feet. He frequently took 25 percent of his shots from there five to 10 years ago. As for assists, James is second in the league to Russell Westbrook, with a career-high 9.3 per game. Though those two statistics seem to show clear improvement, in other areas James is not on an upward trajectory. While he has been the acknowledged as the best player in basketball for many years, he has seldom led the N.B.A. in traditional categories such as scoring (just once). But he has been dominant in advanced stats that try to sum up all of a player’s contributions.
sports/basketball,His peak in those catchall statistics, however, came in his 20s. Take Box Plus/Minus, which accumulates traditional box score stats to judge a player’s overall contributions offensively and defensively. James led the league in this statistic every year from age 23 to 29, putting up figures as high as 13. James has five of the top 10 Box Plus/Minus seasons of all time. But the most recent of those was 2012-13. His Box Plus/Minus this season is 10.5, ahead of his last three seasons. It’s the second-best figure in the league, behind Harden’s. Impressive, ageless, even sublime. But not actually better than five years ago. Similar statistics such as value over replacement player and win shares show the same trends. James was the best player in the league from 2005 to 2013. But he may have slipped slightly from his peak. On another point, Kerr is right. Jordan’s 15th season (which came late because of a break for baseball and a retirement) was clearly inferior to his 10th. So was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s. Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain and Russell did not make it to Season 15. James has switched teams twice in his career, from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat and back, which can change roles and sometimes statistics. And the opinion of a savvy observer like Kerr must be respected. But it also may be a bit overstated. James is incredible, one of the best players at his age ever, maybe the best. But he isn’t actually better than he was five years ago, and probably is just a little behind.
sports/basketball,(Do we need to add that every team in the N.B.A. would take him in a heartbeat anyway?)
sports/basketball,Playing Down to 76ers’ Level, a Short Drop, the Nets Shuffle to Victory  - The New York Times When the Philadelphia 76ers and the Nets traded air balls early in Friday’s game at Barclays Center, fans were still settling in for a night of relatively bad basketball. It turned out worse. It was not just that Joe Johnson dropped an outlet pass out of bounds, or Alan Anderson dribbled a ball off his feet, or Mason Plumlee, the 6-foot-10 forward, missed two easy layups. That was just the first half. The greatest indignity was that the Nets were fighting to beat the two-win 76ers — scraping to ensure a victory well into the fourth quarter, and playing down to Philadelphia’s misshapen brand of basketball in a contest that, at times, appeared as if it were taking place outdoors, on ice, with the players wearing mittens. The Nets won, 88-70, but Philadelphia’s effort could have been considered philanthropic. The 76ers committed 24 turnovers, shot 9 of 33 from inside the paint, and finished with only 11 2-point field goals, the fewest made in a game in the N.B.A. in the shot-clock era. Yet it was the Nets who appeared to be giving the game away Friday, missing 15 3-point attempts, turning the ball over 17 times, and enduring an 0-for-8 shooting night from Deron Williams. It was a close game in the first quarter, somehow, despite Philadelphia’s seven turnovers. It was close at halftime, somehow, even though the Nets had at one point built a 10-point lead in the second quarter.
sports/basketball,And it stayed close in the third quarter, almost against all conventional logic, since the 76ers made 4 of 19 field goals and allowed the Nets to give the sort of inspired second-half effort they have been missing this season. Still, the Nets entered the fourth quarter ahead by 3 points, and only then did they mercifully execute some of their offensive and defensive schemes, getting out in transition and applying pressure on the ball. The 76ers missed their first seven field goals, and before long the Nets’ lead was 13. Philadelphia trimmed it to 8 with 5 minutes 46 seconds remaining but was unable to get any closer. “We did a good job keeping the guys out of the paint, and we held them to one shot and that was huge,” Nets Coach Lionel Hollins said. “We won the rebound battle and we won the turnover battle. I thought the group we had in for the middle and end of the third quarter and through the first half of the fourth quarter did a really nice job of just executing the plan.” Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown, on the other hand, referred to his team’s offense as in “demise.” “I think 24 turnovers is never going to help,” Brown said. “Going 9 of 33 in the paint is never going to help.”
sports/basketball,Still, this was the closest contest the Nets played in nine days, having lost the previous three games by an average of more than 23 points. Trade rumors have swirled around the team for several days, sparked by an ESPN report on Tuesday revealing that the Nets’ star triad — Johnson, Williams and Brook Lopez — might be actively shopped around. Billy King, the Nets’ general manager, played down the speculation before the game. “My job is to listen to people and make calls and get calls back,” King said. “Does that mean we’re having a fire sale? Absolutely not.” King was also asked, essentially, to explain why the players deserved to stay. Given the expectations that King had placed on the Nets before the season, the team’s status hovering near the lower half of a weak Eastern Conference would not appear to sit well. King acknowledged the team’s struggles as unexpected, attributing some of that to injuries and some to the fact that “some guys just haven’t played up to the level we need them to play,” he said. He added: “We’re not playing at the level that we thought we could be playing right now. We’ve had some games where we play well the first half, and the third quarters, they bite us in the butt a couple times. So it’s a situation where we’ve got to find consistency.” REBOUNDS
sports/basketball,Nets General Manager Billy King said that the decision to trade forward Andrei Kirilenko to the 76ers was as much about injecting more youth into the roster than financial flexibility. But Kirilenko, who appeared in only seven games this season, was earning more than $3.3 million this year and costing the Nets more than $11 million with the luxury-tax implications included. The Nets created a $3.4 million trade exception with the move. “For a couple years, we had a 15-man roster with full guarantees,” King said. “Now it does allow us to have some flexibility. But I’m not going into it looking to just move guys, I’m looking to give guys opportunities.”
business,How Bell Pottinger, P.R. Firm for Despots and Rogues, Met Its End in South Africa - The New York Times LONDON — If an autopsy could have been performed on Bell Pottinger, Britain’s most audacious public relations firm, the cause of death may have been summarized as “acute embarrassment.” This is ironic because Bell Pottinger always seemed defiantly beyond shame. During its 30 years in the upper echelons of Britain’s spin doctoring game, it sought to polish the image of dictators (Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus), repressive regimes (Bahrain and Egypt, to name two) and celebrities accused of despicable crimes (the Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius after he was charged with murder). But in early 2016, Bell Pottinger signed a client that ultimately buried it in disgrace. The company worked for the Guptas, three brothers from India who built a sprawling, multibillion-dollar corporate empire in South Africa. Ajay, Tony and Atul Gupta had earned fantastic sums leveraging their friendship with President Jacob G. Zuma. By bullying officials and bending regulations to their will, they secured contracts in fields as varied as armaments, mining and railways. They offered ministerial jobs to politicians of their choosing. The Guptas and Mr. Zuma were so intertwined that critics had taken to referring to the “Zupta regime.” As the power of the Guptas and their holding company, Oakbay Investments, gained attention, the family wanted the public relations equivalent of a stun grenade — a distraction that would draw attention away from them and onto their many enemies.
business,So Bell Pottinger was retained, and given an assignment that initially sounded benign enough: grass-roots political activism intended to help poor blacks. By the following year, Bell Pottinger was embroiled in a national maelstrom. In TV reports, editorials and public rallies, it stood accused of setting off racial tensions through a furtive campaign built on Twitter bots, hate-filled websites and speeches. All were pushing a highly toxic narrative, namely that whites in South Africa had seized resources and wealth while they deprived blacks of education and jobs. The message was popularized with an incendiary phrase, “white monopoly capital.” How Bell Pottinger went bankrupt is a tale of corporate skulduggery that seems lifted from “House of Cards,” the P.R. edition. During the Gupta disaster, a vicious boardroom struggle unfolded, one that pitted a co-founder, Tim Bell, against James Henderson, 53, who ran the firm in the years before it went under. Their conflict centered on the perennials of business potboilers, namely power and money. The story is also an inside look at the current, tormented state of politics in South Africa. Allegations of Gupta-related corruption surfaced gradually over the years, as officials and the media described how this once unknown family was ransacking South Africa and its institutions. President Zuma has since been swept up by investigations into the brothers amid an outcry that he let them hijack the government in a textbook example of “state capture.” With the economy sputtering, Mr. Zuma’s own party has called for his ouster.
business,The scandal has engulfed the nation. Mr. Zuma is a member of the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela and post-apartheid comity. His alliance with the Guptas, and their exploitation of racial animosity, has underscored just how far the party has wandered from its roots after winning its first election in 1994. Though the only corporate fatality, Bell Pottinger is just one of the companies tainted by the Guptas. A small coterie of multinationals is now under investigation by South African authorities, including local units of three companies, McKinsey, KPMG and the software giant SAP. The Guptas’ most devastating legacy is the harm they did to the cause of economic reform. With so many blacks in South Africa mired in poverty, the topic is urgent, but discussion about it has been debased by its association with a notorious and self-serving P.R. campaign. In the midst of that campaign, racial tensions rose to levels that had not been felt since apartheid. “White monopoly capital,” a phrase that for years had been confined to left-wing academic circles, was suddenly unavoidable. A political group with reported links to the Guptas warned of a coming civil war. When Bell Pottinger’s role became public, protesters rallied against the company, both in South Africa and outside the firm’s London office. A subsequent investigation by the Public Relations and Communications Association, a trade group in Britain, ended with the ejection of Bell Pottinger.
business,“In my years of running the P.R.C.A., I have never seen anything worse, never seen anything equal to it,” Francis Ingham, director general of the trade association, said in an interview. “The work was on a completely new scale of awfulness. Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.” Within days of the firm’s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished. London is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become “the global capital of reputation laundering,” as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche. It was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the “Labour isn’t working” ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it. “There were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,” he recalled. “I just had to stand my ground and say, ‘I know what I’m doing.’”
business,Now 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and naïve. “Morality is a job for priests,” he deadpanned in a recent interview, between puffs of an ever-present cigarette. “Not P.R. men.” With the company co-founder, Piers Pottinger, Mr. Bell conceived a “go anywhere, do anything” ethos, as they called it. When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher. Bell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism. “I see the good in people,” he said. This included Chile’s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens. After two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile. Bell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.
business,During the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.  When the company’s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients. In fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these “representatives” said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest. The Azimov executives said they worried about blowback. Fret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, “You get to the point where even if they type in ‘Uzbek child labour’ or ‘Uzbek human rights violation,’ some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.” Mr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an “unethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.”
business,Bell Pottinger’s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out. “We went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,” Mr. Bell recalled. “Great big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.” The family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation. “So we went back to London and wrote a strategy,” said Mr. Bell. “Town hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.” The company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was “a non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid” that Bell Pottinger would package “into speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.” Soon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family’s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.
business,The corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the £100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company’s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement. The billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of “white monopoly capital.” He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project. “It was altogether smelly,” he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas’s checks. “I was saying it’s not a commercially sensible thing to do.” But by the end of March, only one client — the banking and asset management company Investec — had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account “without notice” if the brothers brought discredit to the business.
business,Mr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. “He made my life a misery from start to finish,” said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London’s Sloane Square. After negotiating a £3.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016. For his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger’s dissolution was too recent to discuss. “I have huge empathy for all those impacted,” he said, “and believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.” The P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked. More than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets. There were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.
business,As the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the “stranglehold” that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay. An atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.’s main rival, as a “white party,” adding that it could not “run this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.” New and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, “We have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.” For the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. “There was a shift toward intolerance,” he said. “Gradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.”
business,In a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be “praised for saving jobs.”  “Me and others felt that there was something strange going on under the surface of this onslaught,” said Pieter-Louis Myburgh, author of “The Republic of Gupta.” “Long before Bell Pottinger’s role became known, we smelled a rat.” The campaign coincided with a period in which the Guptas badly needed a makeover. The brothers had moved to South Africa from Uttar Pradesh in India in 1993 at the behest of their father, who thought the end of apartheid was a terrific business opportunity. The Guptas befriended a variety of A.N.C. luminaries, including Mr. Zuma. Relationships with politicians were soon producing results, said Mr. Myburgh. In 2016, South Africa’s Sunday Times listed Atul Gupta as the seventh richest man in the country, with a net worth equivalent to more than $700 million. The brothers had operated in relative obscurity until 2013, when a jet filled with some 200 guests attending the four-day wedding of a Gupta niece was given permission by a highly placed official to land at an air force base that ordinarily barred commercial traffic. The public was incensed. From there, the publicity would only get worse. Politicians described being summoned to the Gupta compound and offered ministerial jobs and, on occasion, multimillion-dollar bribes.
business,In March 2016, a onetime A.N.C. member of Parliament named Vytjie Mentor wrote on Facebook, and later in a sworn affidavit, that the Guptas said she could become minister of public enterprises, though only if she helped cancel the India route flown by South African Airways. (The Guptas had links to a rival.) When she declined, Jacob Zuma ambled into the room and told her, in Zulu, “It’s OK, girl. Take care of yourself,” according to the affidavit. Bell Pottinger’s work for the Guptas was not widely known until November 2016, when a video interview of Ajay Gupta, arranged by the company, leaked to the media. The content of the interview was largely banal. It was proof, though, that one of Britain’s most famous P.R. firms was helping the brothers. The leak alarmed Mr. Henderson because the video resided exclusively on the company’s servers. Mr. Henderson hired Pelican Worldwide, a corporate intelligence firm, to determine whether someone had hacked Bell Pottinger’s system. When no signs of hacking were found, suspicion inside the company fell on Jonathan Lehrle and Darren Murphy, two executives who would depart in December 2016 and start a new P.R. firm with Mr. Bell. Both men deny involvement. Bell Pottinger’s links to the Guptas went full-on radioactive in March of last year, when a mysterious 21-page report was posted on the website of the South African Communist Party. Written anonymously and without any cited sources, the report laid out the history of Bell Pottinger’s work for the Guptas, tagging the firm as the brains behind Twitter hashtags, like #HandsofftheGuptas and an array of bogus social media accounts.
business,Mr. Henderson issued a news release asserting the report contained statements that were “wholly untrue.” He had a point. Although Bell Pottinger was widely blamed for the social media campaign, a forensic analysis performed by the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting concluded that it was created and overseen by employees and affiliates of the Guptas. In a report called “Manufacturing Divides,” the network found that much of the campaign was run out of a Gupta-financed “war room” at a marketing firm in India. Instead, the role of Bell Pottinger was to keep a close eye on social media related to the Guptas and their enemies. A cache of some 200,000 internal documents, christened the GuptaLeaks, that wound up in the media last summer, includes a Bell Pottinger presentation titled “Gupta Family online landscape briefing document.” It tracks mentions of the Guptas and a list of hashtags and keywords, some pro-Gupta, some anti-Gupta. “Sentiment is more positive in conversations online compared to yesterday,” the report states. Likewise, there is scant evidence that Bell Pottinger promoted “white monopoly capital,” the phrase that helped doom it. A law firm report commissioned by the company later concluded that employees of the firm had used the phrase “on occasion.” That is more often than is defensible, though it hardly explains the term’s sudden vogue. The 21-page document had credibility, however, because it contained details that only insiders could have known, some of which were utterly gratuitous. Like the cost to rent the Italian villa for the wedding of Victoria Geoghegan, the Bell Pottinger executive who led the South African team.
business,A few days after the report went public, an anti-Zuma demonstration in South Africa included anti-Bell Pottinger placards. One showed a photograph of Ms. Geoghegan with blood dripping from her lips and the words “Gupta’s Girl” over her head. A demonstration in front of Bell Pottinger’s London office soon followed. In April, Bell Pottinger canceled its deal with the Guptas, citing “increasingly strong social media attacks on our staff and our business.” It didn’t help. Nor did Mr. Henderson’s “unequivocal and absolute apology” in July, or his resignation in September the day before Britain’s P.R. trade group tossed out Bell Pottinger. The company suffered £8 million worth of client losses in 48 hours and layoffs began soon after. Other companies linked, both directly and indirectly, with the Guptas are just beginning to deal with fallout of their own. The South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission is pursuing criminal complaints that emerged from an investigation into state contracts and the Gupta-Zuma nexus, which have ensnared KPMG, SAP and McKinsey. A spokeswoman for KPMG said in a statement that apologies have been made “to those affected,” adding that nine senior partners at the company had departed. SAP issued a statement in October apologizing “wholeheartedly” and noting that three staff members had been placed on leave. McKinsey has denied involvement in acts of bribery or corruption and issued a statement saying, “We are sorry for the distress this matter has caused the people of South Africa.”
business,For its part, Bell Pottinger never shook allegations that it ran that vitriolic social media campaign, nor that it was responsible for injecting “white monopoly capital” into the national dialogue. Clearly, Bell Pottinger was not an innocent bystander, and for a crisis management firm, it did a terrible job of managing this crisis. At least a dozen chances were missed to avert calamity. “As chief executive at the time, I take culpability for not closing down the account in the early stages,” Mr. Henderson said in an interview. “Whilst I was not involved at any time in any way in the account, I should have taken action earlier.” Its errors notwithstanding, the company ended up being blamed for an even greater number of misdeeds than it actually committed, and it is worth asking how that happened. Former employees contend that they were the target of — what else? — a furtive P.R. campaign. Inside Bell Pottinger, it was widely believed that Mr. Bell wanted to damage the company just enough to weaken Mr. Henderson and compel a change of leadership. “Rubbish,” said Mr. Bell, who stated that he had nothing to do with the 21-page report. At the same time, he readily acknowledges that he started plans to take control of Bell Pottinger as soon as he left it. He hoped to line up investors and buy up enough shares to force out Mr. Henderson. He said he abandoned the plan after deciding that the firm was beyond saving.
business,The Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign backfired on just about everyone, especially the Guptas. In an August statement, the brothers said they intended to sell all of their South African holdings by the end of 2017. Mr. Zuma could soon be removed by his party over issues of corruption and the stagnant economy. His term was supposed to end in 2019, but Cyril Ramaphosa, the man who became head of the A.N.C. in December, has called for Mr. Zuma to step down. A judicial inquiry was recently announced to investigate “state capture” and the president’s relationship to the Guptas. A spokesman for the Guptas did not return emails. President Zuma has repeatedly denied all accusations of corruption. Mr. Henderson lost everything when the firm failed, starting with his reputation. He became known as the guy in charge of a public relations company that perished in a public relations fiasco. The British media reported that he lost his entire life’s savings when Bell Pottinger evaporated and for a time, he also seemed to have lost his fiancée. The American socialite Heather Kerzner had invested a sizable chunk of her personal wealth in Bell Pottinger four months before it went under. The wedding was originally scheduled for November. Mr. Henderson said the couple hoped to marry. “That’s our intention,” he said. But arguably the greatest casualty of the Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign is the very cause it nominally championed, helping impoverished blacks. Like most propaganda, the ideas promoted by the Guptas contained kernels of truth. The economic advancement of blacks postapartheid has indeed been painfully slow.
business,The topic is now exponentially more fraught, given its association with the Guptas, who tried to use it as a way to enrich themselves and expand their power. For a young democracy that is grappling with a history of institutionalized racism and trying to spread wealth more evenly throughout the country, the results have been tragic. “The damage done by this campaign is not over,” said Sipho Pityana, a businessman who headed the Department of Labour under the Mandela administration. “It shapes the discourse about inequality in South Africa to this day.”
world/asia,Japan’s Main Opposition Party Elects First Female Leader - The New York Times TOKYO — Renho Murata became the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party in Japan after winning a leadership contest on Thursday. Ms. Murata, who has served in the country’s upper house of Parliament for more than a decade, won in a landslide against two male competitors despite controversy over her part-Taiwanese heritage. By winning the leadership contest, Ms. Murata, who is widely known by just her first name, became the third woman to take up a prominent political job in Japan in less than two months, heralding a budding shift in a country with an abysmal track record of putting women in power. In her final speech before the vote, Ms. Murata, a former model and television news anchor, spoke emotionally about her children, 19-year-old twins, and how she was sometimes frustrated trying to balance work and motherhood. But in her acceptance speech, she did not refer to her gender, speaking only about the challenges ahead. “I ask you all to work together so that our party will be chosen by people for our competence in making proposals, our creativity and our vision for the country,” she said. Political experts said Ms. Murata, 48, could help burnish the image of the Democratic Party, which has been struggling to regain credibility after an ill-fated three years in power before Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in 2012.
world/asia,The public has widely condemned the party as having failed to deliver on campaign promises, as well as bungling the response to the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011. Yet since losing power, the party has done little to differentiate itself from the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Abe’s conservative party, and both parties are dominated by men. “Of the three candidates, she was the only one who has any chance of turning around the party’s fortunes,” said Gill Steel, an associate professor of politics at Doshisha University in Kyoto. Dr. Steel added that for independent voters seeking change, “a party led by and comprised mainly of older men, particularly when younger women are touted as a reformist alternative, does not project an attractive image.” Critics said it would take more than a fresh image to restore the Democratic Party to power. “Although the cover page is being replaced, its content hasn’t changed,” said Atsuo Ito, a political commentator who has been secretary general for both the Liberal Democrats and the Democratic Party of Japan. On policy issues, the two parties have few differences. Mr. Ito said the controversy over Ms. Murata’s part-Taiwanese heritage could also haunt her and the party. Although she was born in Japan and raised there by a Japanese mother and a Taiwanese father, she was designated at birth as a citizen of Taiwan. At the time, Japan granted citizenship only to children with Japanese fathers.
world/asia,The law changed in 1985, when she was 17, and Ms. Murata received Japanese citizenship. Still, Japan does not allow dual citizenship, and because she did not formally relinquish her Taiwan citizenship, nationalist critics have attacked her. When asked by reporters, Ms. Murata first said she had given up her Taiwan citizenship as a teenager. But this week she said she had recently learned she was still considered a citizen of Taiwan and had asked to be removed from the citizenship rolls. Attitudes toward mixed-race citizens have recently been changing in Japan. For two consecutive years, the country has crowned a mixed-race beauty queen. Ms. Murata has always expressed pride in her Taiwanese heritage, but in her final campaign speech on Thursday, she said, “I am proud to be Japanese, and I love my country, Japan.”

us/politics,Right and Left React to the Debate Over the G.O.P. Memo on the F.B.I. - The New York Times The political news cycle is fast, and keeping up can be overwhelming. Trying to find differing perspectives worth your time is even harder. That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen. Has this series exposed you to new ideas? Tell us how. Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com. For an archive of all the Partisan Writing Roundups, check out Our Picks. The editors in National Review: The editorial board at National Review think that the news media (particularly on the left) has overreacted to a push to release a memo drafted by Republican staff members on the House Intelligence Committee, overseen by Representative Devin Nunes of California. They urge the F.B.I. and the Democrats to share their own sides of the story, writing, “This is called public debate, and we assure the Red hunters on the left that this is not how the Kremlin conducts its affairs.” Read more » _____ Noah Rothman in NBC THINK: According to Mr. Rothman, conservatives are right to scrutinize the F.B.I.’s actions, but they have the wrong target in mind. Rather than focusing, as the Nunes memo does, on the law enforcement agency’s handling of the Trump campaign, conservatives should instead be calling for accountability on investigations into Hillary Clinton’s behavior. Read more » _____ Greg Sargent in The Washington Post:
us/politics,Any Republican who does not publicly opposing the release of the Nunes memo, Mr. Sargent contends, is actively aiding the president in politicizing law enforcement. Read more » _____ Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine: Mr. Chait points to the hypocrisy of Republicans who claim that the aim of the Nunes memo is to expose an abuse of the civil liberties of Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign. According to Mr. Chait, Republicans’ newfound concern for the privacy of Mr. Page stands in direct opposition to their “lack of concern about reauthorizing warrantless wiretaps.” Read more » _____ Orin Kerr in Lawfare: Although the memo has yet to be made public, some analysts are presuming that the document asserts that a FISA warrant to monitor Mr. Page was issued by withholding relevant information from the court about the provenance of the evidence against him. Those pushing for the memo’s release argue that because the Justice Department used the dossier compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and never told the court that the document was funded by Democrats, the whole investigation into the Trump’s campaign collusion with Russia was tainted from the start. Mr. Kerr, a libertarian-leaning lawyer, has considerable experience in these questions. He explains how federal judges have faced similar claims in litigation, they have mostly rejected them out of hand.” Read more » _____ Noah Feldman in Bloomberg: 
us/politics,Mr. Feldman argues that Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, is not merely protecting his agency’s reputation when he urged the White House not to release the Nunes memo. Instead, his actions convince Mr. Feldman that he is “fighting back on behalf of the unwritten norm against injecting politics into investigations.” Read more » _____ Jonathan Turley in The Hill:  Mr. Turley, a law professor and constitutional scholar at George Washington University, explains how the whole memo episode may strengthen a rule that has “until now, only been discussed in the abstract by fringe elements in politics and the law.” Subsection 11(g) of Rule X empowers intelligence committees to exercise oversight over intelligence agencies known for overclassifying documents that may be embarrassing or damaging to the agency’s reputation.

garden,HOUSE PROUD; Two Worlds, Gently Colliding - The New York Times Correction Appended SHE'S a babe and he's a slacker, but there's more to it than that. Jenna Lyons, vice president for women's design at J. Crew, and Vincent Mazeau, an artist and a partner in Big Room, a New York design collective that creates sets for television commercials (General Motors), fashion photography (Italian Vogue) and music videos (Ghostface Killah), are just another New York couple trying to make a home. Not a home with an eat-in kitchen and a park view or a deck and a rec room. But the perfect concrete floor. As Mr. Mazeau recalls instructing their contractor: ''It needs to be clean, and we don't want texture, but we want it to look a little mottled. But not funky -- don't try to not do it well.'' (They sent him to Marc Jacobs's shop in SoHo to have a look-see.) And his-and-hers coffee makers -- Gaggia espresso for Mr. Mazeau, 35; Braun drip for Ms. Lyons, 33 -- mounted on pullout shelves and television rotation pads and stowed in a sleek closet column that Mr. Mazeau conceived to conceal the detritus of everyday life from the general minimalist mission statement. Mr. Mazeau, who imagines, then engineers, fantastical environments for a living, calls the closet the Tower of Power. ''Alcohol, spices and coffee,'' he said, displaying it, doors open, like an engine hood popped up. Ms. Lyons and Mr. Mazeau live together in Ms. Lyons's recently renovated loft on lower Broadway, in a building that was a ribbon factory.
garden,And they're in love. ''It's definitely love; you don't do that for everybody,'' Ms. Lyons said, marveling at the mechanics inside the Tower of Power, as Mr. Mazeau demonstrated them for a visitor. ''He was at Zabar's, on his hands and knees with a yardstick, measuring coffee makers,'' she said, as though Mr. Mazeau had been on his knee proposing. Design is the other passion between them. Ms. Lyons and Mr. Mazeau's first date, in 1997, was building a table. It is the centerpiece of the new loft. ''It's falling apart, but we can't get rid of it,'' Ms. Lyons said. Nothing is not a discussion in the design of the loft, and the small things develop into the biggest talks. (A button, as Ms. Lyons knows professionally, can be more important than the shirt.) It starts the minute you walk in the door at 10D. ''We've decided on an American typewriter lowercase d, imbedded in brass in the marble,'' said Mr. Mazeau, pointing to the threshold. ''Brass?'' Ms. Lyons asked, surprised. ''Maybe patinaed or maybe silver,'' Mr. Mazeau said quickly. ''O.K., we're not quite decided,'' Ms. Lyons said, instantly calm again. The eyehole viewer in the door is a ''bulletproof, polycarbonate, military spec lens,'' Mr. Mazeau explained. He discovered it at an industrial resources Web site, thomasregister.com. The style of the loft is modern and spare, with a few strong elements that structure the space, and eccentricity in the details. They are details of Ms. Lyons's fashion sensibility and Mr. Mazeau's boys' toys idea of fun.
garden,Ms. Lyons is working with a stack of samples of antique toile for a bedspread. ''That's one thing I feel is still missing here,'' she said. ''That juxtaposition of period and materials. It's too modern here. There are instances where you want something less severe, that has a sense of history.'' Mr. Mazeau, whose company, Big Room, produced paramilitary, sci-fi sets for W magazine's feature on Brad Pitt, then fresh from ''Fight Club,'' installed a 300-pound-strength electromagnet as a lock on the bathroom door, which rolls into place horizontally like a security wall closing. The thriller effect pleased him; the device cost $50. ''It's like a safe room,'' Mr. Mazeau said, insisting that his visitor try it. A button inside the bathroom activates the magnet, sealing the door and leaving no clue as to how to release it. ''Slide your credit card under the door,'' Mr. Mazeau said, his voice faint through the four-inch door. Another push on the button shut off the magnet. Like many collaborations -- and relationships -- the loft is a work in progress. At the suggestion of a friend, Ms. Lyon and Mr. Mazeau met with David Hotson, an architect, after Ms. Lyon purchased the 1,300-square-foot space two years ago. Mr. Hotson, who has worked with Maya Lin, shared their aesthetic and recognized that their ideas about design would be as important as his. The problem was simple -- ultimately, the solutions were, too.
garden,''Because of the nature of loft space, we didn't have a lot of options,'' Ms. Lyons said. The L-shaped open plan with its wall of windows on Broadway spilled with light. It was swept with a view of sky, and it was less than livable. With loft living more popular than ever, the exquisite rub -- the space is beautiful for its freedom; how do you fence it? -- is becoming a common design dilemma. ''How do you utilize your materials to actually take on forms,'' Ms. Lyons recalled asking herself. ''We didn't want walls. But how do you make some interest architecturally with a box?'' Mr. Hotson helped with several important moves, including an aluminum lighting channel at the center of the ceiling -- a streak that runs the length of the 60-foot loft. It integrates the space with a single, stylish gesture, making a virtue rather than a fault of the narrow leg of the L stretching away from the windows. Ms. Lyons ornamented the channel with an improbably elegant touch -- an elk antler chandelier that she discovered online at antlerchandelier.com, a Web site operated by an antler artist in Montana who lives in the Bitterroot Mountains with, the site explains, ''six hybrid wolf dogs, four cats and horses.'' ''It's my obsession,'' Ms. Lyons said. The rustic fixture, more saloon than salon, is fitted for candles. ''There's something so not New York about it. And they were not killed, they were shed,'' she added, speaking of the antlers and the elks.
garden,''They were harvested,'' Mr. Mazeau said. ''They didn't say they were shed. They just said they were harvested.'' Ms. Lyons had made the call. ''I talked to the guy on the phone,'' she told Mr. Mazeau firmly. ''They were shed.'' Concrete was an important element in the design. The kitchen is in large part concrete -- both floor and countertops -- which gives it a sculptural, more than a utilitarian, presence. Bill Gahon, the contractor, who had not worked with concrete countertops, sealed them with a thick, viscous application, not a thin, invisible coat -- a miscalculation that righted itself in the result. The sealant dried to the hue and quality of a pottery glaze. It looks like vintage Frankoma. ''At first I was taken aback,'' Mr. Mazeau said. ''But then we do get a lot of compliments about it.'' The bathroom also has a concrete floor, and a simple, stonelike shower enclosure: two 700-pound concrete slabs at right angles, like a cleft in rock. The bathroom is lighted, like a cavern with an undisclosed source of natural light, by a glass wall which is, on the other side, the back wall of the kitchen. The glass wall -- two pieces of sandblasted glass, sandwiched with their smooth surfaces facing out so as to be easily washable -- was Mr. Mazeau's idea, picked up at the Helmut Lang boutique in SoHo.
garden,''It's not a dead end,'' Ms. Lyons said of the back of the loft. ''It's beautiful, the light in the bathroom in the afternoons, very sensual. It glows. You don't have the sense that you're cornered or closed off.'' Other parts of the loft are still in the development stage -- deliberately so -- until Ms. Lyons and Mr. Mazeau decide what to do or that they can afford to do what they want to do. The renovation, including the architect's fee, has cost approximately $160,000. The bedroom alcove's brick wall is just that for now. The couple's clothing hangs on garment racks that Ms. Lyons ordered through J. Crew. Even in design, which enjoys its deceptions, honesty can be the best policy, until a better answer appears. ''There's pride involved,'' Ms. Lyons said of the brick wall and its bare facts. ''I don't want to be making excuses for what we couldn't do. I'm much happier looking at something that seems like an idea.'' It is mostly Ms. Lyons's taste that is out on display. Mr. Mazeau cataloged her collection of shoes, for convenience, in image files on a small computer which sits on the floor under her clothes. ''Jenna and I have also collaborated to design my wardrobe to consist entirely of black T-shirts,'' Mr. Mazeau said. ''I only have to worry about the pants.'' Ms. Lyons looked at him with love. Mr. Mazeau, sitting on their white Italian sofa, was wearing a black T-shirt.
garden,Correction: July 12, 2001, Thursday  A group of pictures with an article last week about the renovation of Jenna Lyons's loft on lower Broadway carried a credit that misidentified some of the photographers. A picture of the loft's dining area and another of its doorbell should have been credited to Stuart Tyson, not Antoine Bootz. None of the pictures were by Fred R. Conrad.
business/dealbook,Herbalife Settlement With F.T.C. Ends Billionaires’ Battle - The New York Times In the Wall Street dogfight between two billionaire investors, William A. Ackman won a moral victory but Carl C. Icahn won the war over the future of Herbalife, the nutritional supplements company. On Friday, federal regulators imposed stiff sanctions on Herbalife for deceiving buyers and sellers of its products but stopped short of shutting down the company. Mr. Ackman had wagered big on Herbalife’s demise, while Mr. Icahn had been betting on its ultimate survival. In a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, Herbalife will pay $200 million in consumer relief, hire an outside monitor and make substantial changes to its business practices in the United States that could affect its bottom line, but the company will continue to operate. For nearly four years, Mr. Ackman argued loudly and often that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme that took advantage of customers — at one point staking $1 billion on a decline in Herbalife’s shares in a characteristically brash move to prove his point. He gave numerous public presentations using hundreds of slides and videos to make his case that Herbalife was predatory. He even invoked members of Congress to pressure regulators to take action against the company. In response, Mr. Icahn invested in Herbalife, placing an even bigger bet that it would weather the regulatory scrutiny. Other big Wall Street investors including Daniel S. Loeb and George Soros also piled on against Mr. Ackman. But Mr. Icahn seemed to particularly relish going toe-to-toe with Mr. Ackman, famously calling the hedge fund manager a “crybaby in the schoolyard” when the two men squared off with each other during a live CNBC broadcast in January 2013.
business/dealbook,To win his bet, Mr. Ackman needed regulators at the F.T.C. to either shut down Herbalife or take some action that would cause shares of Herbalife to crash. Mr. Ackman, founder of the $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund, had said on a number of occasions he expected shares of Herbalife to go to zero. He even appeared in a documentary earlier this year about the tussle, called “Betting on Zero.” Instead, shares of Herbalife shot up more than 10 percent on Friday on the news of the settlement and most recently were trading at $65 a share. “This settlement will require Herbalife to fundamentally restructure its business so that participants are rewarded for what they sell, not how many people they recruit,” Edith Ramirez, the F.T.C. chairwoman, said in a news release announcing the settlement and the filing of a complaint in federal court seeking a permanent injunction and other relief against the company. In a conference call with reporters, Ms. Ramirez said Herbalife had been “deceiving hundreds of thousands of hopeful people” with the belief they could get rich. But she would not say whether or not the company was a pyramid scheme as Mr. Ackman has claimed. The commission’s “focus wasn’t on a particular label,” Ms. Ramirez added. The complaint filed on Friday by the F.T.C. against Herbalife in federal court in Los Angeles does call into question some of the company’s longstanding distribution practices and ways it generates revenue by relying on customers to sell products to friends and relatives. The complaint says, “the overwhelming majority of Herbalife distributors who pursue the business opportunity make little or no money and a substantial percentage lose money.”
business/dealbook,The agreement with the F.T.C. will require Herbalife to overhaul its system for compensating its customers and recording sales of its supplement drinks and other food products. Over time, the structural changes mandated by the F.T.C. in the settlement and civil complaint could have a long-term impact on Herbalife’s profitability. The settlement with the F.T.C. “does not change our direct-selling business model and will set new standards for the industry,” a spokesman for Herbalife said in a statement. “We agreed to the terms and to pay $200 million because we simply wanted to move forward with our mission.” The company also took a swipe at Mr. Ackman in its statement, saying it had been “under attack by an intransigent short-seller hellbent on a misinformation campaign designed to destroy our company.” Mr. Ackman was noticeably low-key after the announcement of the settlement. His firm released a statement in which it insisted that Herbalife’s business model would fail once the company instituted the structural changes required by the settlement. “We expect that once Herbalife’s business restructuring is fully implemented, these fundamental structural changes will cause the pyramid to collapse,” the statement said. Mr. Ackman’s contention that Herbalife is an unlawful pyramid scheme has focused on the company’s sales practices. Herbalife relies on independent resellers who are rewarded for recruiting new members, and Mr. Ackman argued that these recruitment efforts were more lucrative than the sale of its products.
business/dealbook,In the near term, the settlement will be bad news for investors in Mr. Ackman’s hedge fund who have lost money investing in his fund over the last year and a half. While Mr. Ackman has restructured the bet against Herbalife — known as a short — reducing it by more than 60 percent, he still has exposure. And he has spent more than $50 million on research and legal fees for his campaign against the company So far this year, Mr. Ackman’s Herbalife bet has lost him 11 percent, according to his most recent investor update. His Pershing Square Holdings fund is down 19.1 percent. In a separate note to investors on Friday, Pershing Square said Herbalife was trying “to spin the settlement remarkably as somehow an endorsement of their business model” and that over the long haul the outcome would be “materially positive for our short position.” Herbalife said on Friday that it would let Mr. Icahn increase his ownership stake to as much as 35 percent from the 18 percent of the company’s outstanding shares he currently holds. The move could set the stage for Mr. Icahn and others to take Herbalife private, an action that would make it difficult to determine the economic impact of the changes in business practices on Herbalife’s bottom line. In a statement, Mr. Icahn said he would ”consider a range of strategic opportunities, including potential roll-ups involving competitors, as well as other strategic transactions.” Mr. Icahn also wasted no time in gloating over his victory.
business/dealbook,“Unlike many of those that ‘shorted’ Herbalife, we did not rely on one or two research papers prepared by nonexperts,” he said in his statement Friday morning. “While Bill Ackman and I are on friendly terms, we have agreed to disagree (vehemently) on this subject,” Mr. Icahn said, adding that the F.T.C.’s settlement “vindicates our research and conviction.” It was almost two years ago to the day that Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman hugged and made up publicly on stage at an investor conference in Manhattan. “It’s not about winning,” Mr. Ackman said at that conference on July 16, 2014. But, he added, “I would love to get Carl out of this stock.” After Friday’s settlement that possibility looks less likely than ever.

technology/personaltech,Chair Pitched as Answer to New Ways We Sit on Job - The New York Times The first time I had to buy a mattress, I remember being shocked at how much it cost. “Ah, but just remember,” the sales representative told me, “you’re going to spend a third of your life on it. Isn’t it worth investing in something you’ll use for a third of your life?” When you think of it that way, maybe it’s not quite so crazy to spend $1,000 on a desk chair. You sit in that thing eight hours a day, too. Actually, the term “desk chair” may be obsolete. That, anyway, is the conclusion that Steelcase has reached after conducting what it says was a study of 2,000 people in 11 countries — and how they sit. (The people, not the countries.) Steelcase says people don’t just sit upright in their chairs anymore. In this age of phones, tablets and laptops, people slouch and lean back and curl up in all kinds of new ways. Nine new ways, in fact, to which the company has given names like the Cocoon (reclining, feet on the seat, legs drawn in), the Take It In (slumped way back, arms relaxed while you watch a video) and the Strunch (a stretched hunch from chair edge to table, laptop pushed far away from you, chin propped up with nondominant hand).
technology/personaltech,According to Steelcase, if you don’t have the right chair, each of these new postures can lead to fatigue, pain and injury. For example, hunching forward to see your laptop “leads to disc compression, excess pressure on the neck and strain on the back and shoulders.” If your chair’s arms don’t support yours when you’re using the mouse for a long time, you can get “unnatural twisting of the wrists, hands, elbows and shoulders.” And it’s important to move around, to shift, to avoid hours in the same position. Otherwise, you might “decrease blood flow in the legs.” The fruit of all of this research, study and philosophizing is the new Steelcase Gesture chair, available later this fall for $980 and up (depending on whether you opt for leather, vinyl, cloth and so on). It’s supposed to be the ultimate work chair — “a new sitting experience,” the company asserts. It certainly is comfortable. Both the seat and the back are deeply padded and expansive; you could even, if you wanted, sit with your legs tucked under you, or partly so. The arms are connected to the chair behind you, so they don’t block your thigh should you decide to swing it over the side. And it certainly is adjustable. Like most office chairs, you can make this one taller or shorter when you press a lever on the chair’s stem. The chair spins easily and rolls extremely easily on its five ball-bearing feet, which, as my 8-year-old can attest, is loads of fun.
technology/personaltech,The back can recline very far — farther than any other Steelcase chair — without risk of toppling backward, which is never a good way to score points in the office. You can adjust the tension on the spring, too, so that it goes back and forward more or less easily. You can lock the back into one of five angles with the flip of a lever. All the controls are on the right side, below seat level. By turning a knob, you can move the seat forward or backward relative to the back, to accommodate the longer or shorter of limb. The armrests are miracles of mobility. By squeezing a lever under each one, you can move them fluidly and independently up or down, inward or outward. And in any of these positions, you can rotate the armrests. The designers also put a lot of thought into where to end the chair’s various pieces. For example, the arms are short enough that they don’t get in the way when you want to pull up close to the table or desk. And the back doesn’t extend past your torso. It doesn’t block or restrict you when you turn to around to yell, “Hey, Frank! Do we have any C-120s in stock?” Finally, a shout-out to whoever had the idea of wrapping the padding all the way around all four sides of the seat’s edges. Suppose, for example, that you wanted to assume a position that’s not among the Steelcase Nine. That’s entirely possible, thanks to this all-the-way-around padding; you can hang a limb over any of the seat’s edges without worrying about getting gangrene.
technology/personaltech,(Don’t try that with the famous Herman Miller Aeron chair. Its sharp, rigid seat edges could lop your leg right off.) And, so, yes: This is a wonderful chair. It’s supremely comfortable, impressively adjustable, exceptionally supportive. And yes, it’s also true that we work in weird new positions these days. What’s not so clear is Steelcase’s claim that these two statements are connected. In other words, just how much of a breakthrough is the Gesture chair? After you clear away the smoke from those arguments about our modern mobile gadgets, is the Gesture actually any more flexible than its rivals? I made a pilgrimage to a couple of high-end office-furniture stores to find out. And here’s the baffling thing that I discovered: The Gesture is, at best, only a small advance. It seems to be intended as a body blow at the Herman Miller Embody chair, which may not come with marketing materials about 2,000 people in 11 countries, but which you can adjust in nearly identical ways. The chair goes up and down, the seat goes forward and back, the back reclines a lot, the armrests go up and down and inward and outward. The Gesture wins this round, though. The Embody chair costs much more ($1,300), and is slightly less adjustable; its armrests don’t rotate. More mysteriously, the Gesture isn’t even that much of a leap beyond the Leap, Steelcase’s own earlier adjusto-chair and its most popular model. You can adjust the Leap in most of the same ways as the Gesture, but it costs less.
technology/personaltech,The Leap is a more responsible choice, too: 94 percent of it is recyclable, and 30 percent of it is made of recycled material (well, “up to” 30 percent). It, too, is available in various colors of cloth or leather. Now, the Gesture looks much more modern, much more sculptural and much classier. It says “high-tech executive” more than “worker bee with sciatica.” But all that stuff about a “new sitting experience” — that’s clearly baloney. And it’s possible to find nits to pick even with the Gesture. You can’t change the angle of the seat, if you care. There’s no headrest. And the armrests are hard plastic; a little cushioning wouldn’t hurt. So yeah, the company’s attempt to connect its conclusions — “we sit differently these days, and it’s healthy to shift positions often” — with its latest chair may reek of marketing department desperation. But the conclusions themselves are sound. We do sit differently these days, and we should shift positions often. Fortunately, there are plenty of chairs that will serve you well in these departments. The Gesture is an excellent candidate, but so are the Leap, the Embody and others. You don’t have to pay these steep, designery prices, either; many other ergonomic chairs, made with more plastic and fewer adjustments, are available in much lower price ranges. The point is not that you should buy a Gesture chair. The point is that you should buy some good, comfortable, ergonomic chair.
technology/personaltech,After that, think of the life you’ll lead. You’ll have a terrific chair for eight hours of each day and a nice mattress for another eight hours. How you stay comfortable and healthy during the remaining eight is up to you.
opinion,‘The Umbrella Man’ - The New York Times For years, I’ve wanted to make a movie about the John F. Kennedy assassination. Not because I thought I could prove that it was a conspiracy, or that I could prove it was a lone gunman, but because I believe that by looking at the assassination, we can learn a lot about the nature of investigation and evidence. Why, after 48 years, are people still quarreling and quibbling about this case? What is it about this case that has led not to a solution, but to the endless proliferation of possible solutions? Years ago, Josiah Thompson, known as Tink, a young, Yale-educated Kierkegaard scholar wrote the definitive book on the Zapruder film — “Six Seconds in Dallas.”  Thompson eventually quit his day job as a professor of philosophy at Haverford College to become a private detective and came to work with many of the same private  investigators I had also worked with in the 1980s. We had so much in common — philosophy, P.I. work and an obsessive interest in the complexities of reality. But we had never met. Last year, I finally got to meet and interview Tink Thompson. I hope his interview can become the first part of an extended series on the Kennedy assassination. This film is but a small segment of my six-hour interview with Tink.

business/international,Pokémon Go, With a Corporate Tie-in, Debuts in Japan - The New York Times TOKYO — Pikachu, Bulbasaur and other creatures of the Pokémon universe returned like conquering heroes to their home country on Friday, and they brought with them a message: Eat at McDonald’s. Pokémon Go, the wildly popular mobile game, was released on Friday in Japan, the country that gave rise to the entertainment franchise two decades ago. By evening, more than 10 million people had downloaded the game, its developers said. The game’s highly anticipated introduction here — several weeks and tens of millions of downloads after it became an unexpected megahit in the United States and other countries — was treated as a national event, with widespread news coverage and a cautious endorsement from the government. It also offered a test of how Pokémon Go and games like it might find new ways to make money. The game’s creators have struck a deal with the Japanese affiliate of McDonald’s to make most of its 2,900 stores in the country available as special game locations. At these in-game “gyms” and “Poké spots,” Pokémon Go players can pit their monsters against other players’ menageries, or collect items that bolster their creatures’ power. The fast-food company hopes they will buy Big Macs and French fries, too, but does not require it. McDonald’s hopes to draw players like Takahiro Notoya, 33, a web developer who said he had captured five Pokémon by midway through his lunch break in the crowded Shibuya neighborhood. As he walked by a McDonald’s outlet with a colleague, the chain’s red-and-gold logo popped up on his smartphone screen.
business/international,“I played Pokémon games and watched the TV show when I was a kid, and it’s amazing to see it take off like this,” he said. Just then, his colleague Naoki Kaneko, 23, announced he had spotted a caterpillarlike Caterpie near the restaurant’s entrance and began flinging virtual balls at the creature on his screen to capture it. Technology companies have increasingly turned to mobile as consumers give up their desktop computers and shift much of their time to smartphones and tablets. But mobile has proved to be a difficult area to make money, in part because smaller screens do not offer as much space for advertising. One widespread strategy has been to give players a chance to spend real-world money to buy items they can use to make their digital alter egos more powerful. But Pokémon Go and other so-called augmented-reality games, which fuse digitally created fantasies with physical locations, have additional options, like charging businesses to direct game players to their doorsteps. Like old-time treasure hunts, augmented reality games unfold in real neighborhoods, and for every grumpy resident who wants to keep players off their lawn there is a business that is happy to attract them. Because the game’s creators decide where the treasure is hidden, they can effectively dictate where players go. Pokémon Go will have both in-app purchases and sponsored locations, John Hanke, the chief executive of Niantic, said in a recent interview. Niantic, a spinoff of Google, is one of the companies behind Pokémon Go, along with Nintendo of Japan.
business/international,Niantic honed the revenue model for Pokémon Go with a previous augmented reality game, a science fiction role-playing game called Ingress that had the Circle K convenience store chain as a location sponsor. For McDonald’s, the association could give a needed push in Japan, a market in which it has stumbled lately. The Japanese affiliate has closed about 200 restaurants in the last two years, and it lost 34.9 billion yen, or about $329 million, last year, as it has struggled to adapt to changing consumer preferences and regain trust after several food-contamination scandals. Shares in McDonald’s Japan jumped to a 15-year high after news of the sponsorship leaked this week, while Nintendo’s market value has swelled by billions of dollars since Pokémon Go made its debut in the United States. Niantic and Nintendo did not explain why the game was released late in Japan, although securing enough server capacity has been an issue in other markets. Many players said they had grown frustrated with the wait. “I’ve been studying up on all the tricks to catch Pikachu,” the game’s signature yellow monster, said Tomoki Tanaka, a 15-year-old-high school student who was hunting for Pokémon with a classmate, Ryuta Mizusawa. They had not been born when Nintendo introduced Pokémon as a game for its classic Game Boy hand-held console in the mid-1990s, but they grew up with subsequent iterations of the franchise.
business/international,Yoshihide Suga, the government’s chief cabinet secretary, said he was “very happy that content from our country is so popular around the world.” But echoing authorities in other counties wary of potential nuisance and accidents by distracted players, he encouraged fans to “use their smartphones safely.”
science,732,000: American Lives Saved by Vaccination - The New York Times The vaccination of children from 1994 to 2013 will prevent 732,000 early deaths in the United States, according to a recent estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a report published last month, the agency announced that 90 percent of children under age 3 were vaccinated against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and chickenpox in 2014. But fewer than 90 percent received DTaP — the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis — or the vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae Type B, pneumococcal disease, hepatitis A and rotavirus.In addition, fewer than 90 percent received the recommended hepatitis B dose at birth. About 71 percent of children received the combined vaccine series — shots containing more than one vaccine, including the DTaP (at least four doses); polio (at least three doses); measles, mumps and rubella (at least one); Haemophilus influenzae Type B (at least three or four); hepatitis B (at least three); chickenpox (at least one); and pneumococcus (at least four doses). Only 0.7 percent of children received no vaccines at all. Vaccination coverage varied in 2014 by geographic area and the type of vaccine. For example, 93 percent of children in Maine received the DTaP vaccine, but only 73 percent of those in Wyoming did. Over all, there was lower coverage among non-Hispanic black children, compared with non-Hispanic whites, a disparity probably explained by greater poverty among blacks. Fourteen percent fewer children living below the poverty line were vaccinated against rotavirus, for example, compared with those living above the poverty line.
science,“The really positive message here is that even though we hear a lot about vaccine refusal, most parents choose to protect their children,” said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a pediatrician with the C.D.C. “It’s impressive that so many parents are coming in to get their children vaccinated on time. Parents, providers and government have worked together to accomplish this.” In addition to preventing more than three-quarters of a million deaths, vaccination has prevented an estimated 322 million illnesses and 21 million hospitalizations over the past two decades. The C.D.C. estimates that this has produced a net savings of $1.38 trillion in health care costs. “We sometimes forget how much disease we’re preventing,” Dr. Cohn said.
world/asia,South Korean Leader Marks Anniversary of War’s End With Warnings to North Korea - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea —  President Park Geun-hye of South Korea on Saturday urged North Korea to stop what she called military provocations on the border, hours after the North threatened to attack loudspeakers that the South has begun using to blast propaganda messages into North Korea. Ms. Park’s comments, in a speech on the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the Korean Peninsula, then unified, from Japanese rule, came a week and a half after two South Korean soldiers were badly wounded by land mines that the South says were planted by the North in the demilitarized zone now dividing the Koreas. “North Korea must wake up from its delusional belief that it can maintain its regime through provocations and threats,” Ms. Park said in her speech. “They lead only to isolation and destruction.” South Korean leaders have traditionally commemorated the anniversary of the war’s end, called Liberation Day here, with a speech expressing hope for Korean reunification. The end of Japanese colonial rule seven decades ago was soon followed by Korea’s division, as the Soviet Union installed a communist government in the north and the United States a capitalist one in the south. Ms. Park’s speech on Saturday included both condemnations and overtures directed at North Korea. She urged it to learn from Cuba’s moves to improve relations with the United States, but said the North had been “walking in the other direction,” referring to its nuclear weapons development, executions of officials deemed disloyal to the government and recent provocations along the border.
world/asia,Ms. Park also reiterated the South’s accusation that the North had planted the mines that maimed the soldiers, near their outpost on the southern side of the demilitarized zone. One soldier lost both his legs to a mine, and the other lost one. North Korea has denied planting the mines, accusing the South of fabricating evidence that it had done so. Ms. Park also offered suggestions for improving relations, saying that the Koreas could resume their sporadic efforts to reunite families separated by the Korean War of 1950-53, and could build trust by cooperating on fighting floods, droughts and epidemics, as well as sponsoring joint sports and cultural events. “For Koreans, the real liberation from colonial rule is not completed until we have reunification,” she said. Hours before Ms. Park’s speech, the North Korean military issued an “open warning” vowing to launch “unrestrained attacks” on the South Korean loudspeakers along the border if they were not removed, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. South Korea responded that it would target “the origins of attack” if its loudspeakers were hit by North Korean shells. Both Koreas used such loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda at the border for decades until 2004, during a period of reconciliation, when they agreed to stop the practice. South Korea considered resuming the broadcasts in 2010, after one of its naval ships was sunk by what it said was a North Korean torpedo, but decided against it. This past week, the South activated the loudspeakers after 11 years, in response to the maiming of the soldiers at the border.
world/asia,In her address on Saturday, Ms. Park also responded to the closely watched speech on Friday by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, in which he reiterated his country’s past expressions of remorse for World War II but did not offer a new apology of his own. Ms. Park said the speech “left much to be desired” and said Japan’s words should be backed up with “consistent and sincere conduct.”
world/asia,Pakistani Police Clash With Backers of Opposition Leader Imran Khan - The New York Times ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Clashes erupted Monday between the riot police and thousands of supporters of the opposition politician Imran Khan in northwestern Pakistan, ahead of his plan to hold a protest in the Pakistani capital later this week. Mr. Khan has announced that his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, will “lock down” the capital on Wednesday and prevent the government from functioning until Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif steps down or faces corruption charges. At least 2,500 supporters and activists of Mr. Khan’s party clashed with the riot police at the border of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Provinces. The police used rubber bullets and canisters of tear gas to stop them from advancing toward Islamabad. The motorway connecting the two regions was blocked with shipping containers and barricades. In the group was Pervez Khattak, a senior figure within Mr. Khan’s party and the chief minister of Khyber-Pakhthunkwa Province, who said he would force the issue by continuing to try reaching the capital. The authorities have arrested at least 830 supporters of Mr. Khan’s party across several districts of Punjab Province in recent days. Mr. Khan has been leading a campaign for the removal of Mr. Sharif over allegations of election fraud and corruption. Political pressure has increased on Mr. Sharif this year, particularly after the so-called Panama Papers revealed that his family had accumulated offshore wealth. Mr. Sharif has rejected accusations of corruption, and has expressed openness to an investigation. But the opposition political parties and the government remain divided over how to conduct the inquiry.
world/asia,Adding to Mr. Sharif’s political woes is his increasingly tense relationship with the powerful military, which has been wary of his efforts to have a greater say in the country’s foreign and defense policies. The latest dip in relations came earlier in October, when a leading newspaper reported that civilian leaders had warned the military of growing international isolation and demanded action against banned militant groups, which are believed to have the tacit support of the country’s intelligence agencies. Mr. Sharif called the report fabricated, and the military has pressed for an investigation, stressing that a distorted version of the conversation was leaked to the newspaper to malign the intelligence services. On Saturday, Mr. Sharif asked the information minister, Pervez Rashid, to step down. Mr. Khan has increased pressure on the government with his plans for a massive street protest on Wednesday. Government officials have said that street protests are unwarranted, as the courts have already taken up the matter. But Mr. Khan has urged his followers to reach Islamabad and said that he expects one million people to shut down the capital’s streets. On Monday, a high court in Islamabad directed Mr. Khan’s party to hold an approved rally at a designated public space, but Mr. Khan said he would appeal the decision in the Supreme Court. In 2014, Mr. Khan led thousands of his supporters to stage a sit-in in the capital for months. The protest fizzled out but left Mr. Sharif’s government weakened.
world/asia,This time, Mr. Sharif seems determined not to take any chances, as rumors swirl that a violent clash between protesters and police could lead to intervention by the army. All roads leading to Mr. Khan’s residence in Bani Gala, a suburb of Islamabad, have been barricaded, and heavy contingents of police and paramilitary troops have surrounded his luxurious home, which sits on a hill overlooking the capital.
us,Wisconsin’s Treasurer Wants to Cut Needless Workers, Starting With Himself - The New York Times MADISON, Wis. —  Last Wednesday, in the grand Beaux-Arts Capitol here, throngs of lawmakers and tourists milled around upstairs. Matt Adamczyk, the newly elected state treasurer, however, was in his basement office — alone. Just a week earlier, there were two other employees in the office, but Mr. Adamczyk had them fired, explaining that they were a waste of taxpayer money and no longer needed. Laptops and telephones were scattered around a table, remnants from a time when the treasurer’s office was much busier. Next on Mr. Adamczyk’s to-do list: Get rid of his own job. In what may be the ultimate expression of many Republicans’ desire to whittle down government to the bone, Mr. Adamczyk ran for treasurer on the promise to eliminate the position during his one and only term in office. Despite its impressive name, the Office of the State Treasurer is virtually powerless. Most of its duties have gradually been transferred to other state agencies, like the Department of Revenue. One of the treasurer’s few remaining responsibilities is to help supervise a little-known agency called the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands. Mr. Adamczyk was elected by a toothpick-thin margin in November, winning with just 49 percent of the vote. He was sworn in on Jan. 5, and has wasted little time in beginning to fulfill his campaign promises to cut what he sees as waste.
us,“I’m a big believer in efficiency,” said Mr. Adamczyk, 36, round-faced and garrulous. “I’ve always just thought that this office doesn’t really have any duties left.” Getting rid of his own job would require a constitutional amendment, a measure that technically could not happen until 2017, assuming the Legislature approved it, Mr. Adamczyk said. But in his first few weeks in office, he has searched for what he calls egregious government waste, and tried to stamp it out. Eliminating his employees’ jobs has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars, he said. Then there is the smaller stuff: an unused printer sits ready to be returned. Laptop cases that belong to no one were stacked on a wooden table. He spent one day recently on the phone with Verizon trying to determine why his office had more active cellphone contracts than it did employees. During a tour of his office, Mr. Adamczyk pointed out examples of how his predecessors, in his opinion, frittered away taxpayers’ dollars. Opening a large cardboard box, he pulled out tiny blue plastic piggy banks with the department’s name printed on the side. “Do we need these?” he asked. “No, we don’t.” Mr. Adamczyk held up a new iPhone, still sealed in plastic. “This was a ‘floater’ phone,” he said. “No one ever used it. It cost $58 a month. You almost can’t make this stuff up.” There is plenty of bipartisan support for abolishing the treasurer’s office. But some of Mr. Adamczyk’s recent efforts to root out waste have caused many people, including some fellow Republicans, to question whether his motives go beyond penny pinching.
us,Mr. Adamczyk has garnered attention by targeting Tia Nelson, a state official who heads the agency that he helps supervise, the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands. Ms. Nelson is the daughter of Gaylord Nelson, a former governor and United States senator best known for creating Earth Day. The small agency manages some public lands, mostly in northern Wisconsin, oversees a trust that makes loans to towns and provides money to school libraries. Mr. Adamczyk is one of three elected officials on the board. The others are Secretary of State Doug La Follette, a Democrat, and Attorney General Brad Schimel, a Republican. According to public records, Mr. Adamczyk has repeatedly asked how the agency spends money. Additionally, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that he tried to force Ms. Nelson to remove her name from the agency’s letterhead but was overruled by the other board members. Even the agency’s newspaper subscriptions have not gone unnoticed by Mr. Adamczyk. The public lands office subscribes to several newspapers, including The Wisconsin State Journal, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Mr. Adamczyk told Ms. Nelson that she should discontinue her subscription to The Times. “I am beyond disappointed in this expense,” he wrote in an email to Ms. Nelson, adding, “this is simply a want and NOT A NEED.”
us,He also objected to a brief mention of global warming on the agency’s website. In an email dated Dec. 23, he wrote to Ms. Nelson, “On the BCPL website, there is a sentence that states: ‘Global climate change is no longer debatable as a threat to ecosystems.’ Why is the BCPL concerned with discussing the hot button issue of ‘global climate change.’ ” In an interview, Mr. Adamczyk criticized Ms. Nelson — who has spent much of her career working on environmental policy issues — for testifying before a Congressional committee on global warming in 2009. Jack Voight, a Republican and the state treasurer from 1995 to 2007, called Mr. Adamczyk’s efforts against Ms. Nelson “a politically motivated witch hunt.” “She did a great job when I was there, and I think she has continued to do a great job,” Mr. Voight said. “She has never exhibited any political leanings whatsoever in that office.” When asked to comment, Ms. Nelson pointed to the agency’s track record. “The history of Wisconsin’s Board of Commissioners of Public Lands is a rare and enviable story of government success, unique in this country. Ours is the oldest state agency and one of the smallest, yet, with bipartisan support — a staff of 10 and not a penny of taxpayer money, we serve the people of Wisconsin at an operational efficiency unmatched in the private sector.” Raised in the Milwaukee area, Mr. Adamczyk said he was politically active from a young age, relishing his first participation in a presidential election when he cast a vote for Bob Dole in 1996.
us,After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in 2000, he worked in the Capitol for two members of the state Assembly. The office of state treasurer caught his eye years ago, he said, because it was so notorious among lawmakers for its lack of power. Though he has not yet figured out a way to do so, Mr. Adamczyk has vowed to return 25 percent of his $69,936 salary to the state.
sports/baseball,Turning 90, Yogi Berra Is Still a Cherished M.V.P. - The New York Times
sports/football,To Dodge Jerry Jones, Other Owners Speed Up Roger Goodell’s Contract - The New York Times The N.F.L. owners negotiating a contract extension for the league commissioner, Roger Goodell, are accelerating their work, according to several people familiar with the matter, to quell an insurgent, unusually public threat by Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys’ owner, to scuttle the deal. The owners, who agreed in May to extend the commissioner’s contract, are pushing to complete the terms in a matter of weeks to end the public battle with Jones, who began a campaign to undermine the extension after the commissioner suspended a star running back on the Cowboys over a domestic violence accusation. The committee of owners negotiating the contract is meeting on Monday to discuss, among other things, when to finish the extension so it is no longer a political volleyball. Some owners on the committee want the extension completed in a couple of weeks, while some say it can wait until the next owners’ meeting in mid-December. Jones, a powerful owner who has increasingly tried to influence league matters, has emerged as an erratic insurgent among owners who prize order and typically settle differences amicably behind closed doors. Owners were already unsettled by the tumult over players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem and a slew of injuries to star players, not to mention a slip in television ratings.
sports/football,People familiar with the contract negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they involve internal league matters, said the package was 80 percent to 90 percent completed, with only a handful of minor details yet to be finished. As a nonvoting member of the compensation committee, Jones, though, continued to lobby the committee working on the pay package. Last week, The New York Times reported that he told the six owners on the committee that he had hired the lawyer David Boies and was prepared to take legal action against them and the league if they did not change Goodell’s deal. Jones has insisted that Goodell’s deal needs to be restructured to account for the poor way he has navigated the league through recent turmoil, and that more of his pay should be performance-based bonuses. After Jones threatened to sue the members of the committee — which includes the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans — he was removed as a nonvoting member. Jones was fully aware of, and in agreement with, the committee’s efforts to restructure the contract, according to people familiar with the committee’s work. On Aug. 9, Goodell traveled from his summer home in Maine to New York to meet with the compensation committee at Patroon, a restaurant a few blocks from the league’s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.
sports/football,The mood was comfortable. Two of the owners, Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons, joked about how, when they walked to the restaurant together, fans had stopped them to say they were surprised that they were together after their teams faced off in the Super Bowl in February. In a private room, the owners discussed the structure of Goodell’s new deal and some of the finer points the commissioner wanted added. Jones was not in New York, but was listening on a speaker phone. “We got to a good place that night,” one person involved in the dinner said. “Jerry was on board with all of it.” Two days later, everything changed when Goodell suspended the Cowboys’ star running back, Ezekiel Elliott, for six games based on an accusation of domestic violence by his former girlfriend. In addition to railing against the decision and questioning the way the commissioner and his staff handled the investigation, Jones began to lobby the compensation committee and other owners to pause and alter Goodell’s new pay deal. On his radio show on Friday, Jones denied that his effort to block the contract extension had anything to do with Elliott, saying it was all about Goodell’s performance lately. In October, when all 32 owners met in New York, Blank, the chairman of the committee, briefed them on the structure of the deal. There was little opposition. But several weeks ago, Jones held a conference call with more than a dozen owners not on the compensation committee to discuss Goodell’s extension.
sports/football,When that failed to turn the tide against the extension, Jones spoke on a conference call last week with the compensation committee and threatened to take legal action. Stunned, the committee took the extraordinary step of removing Jones from the committee, and lawyers have since handled communication between the committee and Jones. Jones’s threat now appears to have galvanized the committee and Goodell to conclude the last few items in the new contract. Goodell is currently paid around $30 million a year, including a set of rolling bonuses that in effect make most of his compensation guaranteed. In his new package, Goodell would receive roughly the same amount, but only if certain performance targets were met. After the owners voted unanimously in May to extend Goodell’s contract for five more years, the compensation committee created a new structure in which 88 percent of the commissioner’s compensation would be based on an array of metrics tied to the league’s financial performance. Many of those metrics would be overseen by other owners on other committees, broadening the number of people who would decide how much the commissioner would make. Goodell, who has sought to defuse the controversy over players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem, has devoted more time in recent days to working out the final details so this controversy, too, might subside.
arts/music,The Playlist: Jay Z Responds to Police Shootings With ‘Spiritual’ - The New York Times
business/international,China’s Energetic Enforcement of Antitrust Rules Alarms Foreign Firms - The New York Times HONG KONG —  When almost 100 government antitrust investigators simultaneously marched into four of Microsoft’s offices across China late last month, they were not looking for tea and gossip. In what Microsoft characterized internally as “surprise visits,” the agents from China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce interrogated a company vice president and other senior managers, copied contracts and financial records, and downloaded large amounts of data from the company’s computer servers, including emails and other internal communications. The swoop on Microsoft stood out for its scale, but it was just one of dozens of similar actions across China recently that have set off alarm in boardrooms across the globe. Chinese regulators appear to be energetically expanding enforcement of the antimonopoly law, and foreign companies fear that they could become easy targets for officials from an array of competing agencies and local governments aiming to impress President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader who has promoted visions of patriotic resurgence and technological pre-eminence. The regulators’ increasing application of the antimonopoly law, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics & Business at Indiana University, embodies the party leadership’s efforts to overhaul the economy without abandoning control of the levers of power. “China’s not moving towards a free market, but it’s moving towards a wider palette of regulatory tools,” Mr. Kennedy said. “These aren’t meant to create a level playing field; they obviously want the field to be slanted, but they want to use what I’d guess we call more sophisticated tools.”
business/international,Foreign companies worry that the investigations could represent the rise of a newer, subtler form of protectionism, one cloaked in regulatory impartiality but intended primarily to promote Chinese companies, especially the big, powerful state-owned companies. The government contends that it is using the antimonopoly law, first established in 2008, to protect the interests of consumers against price gouging and other abuses. “If China is going to be the third leg in the global antitrust regime, along with the U.S. and the E.U., and that’s clearly coming, then the key question is, What sort of approach is China going to take?” John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council in Washington, said in a telephone interview. “Is it going to be more the socialist state-run model, or is it going to be more of a market- and consumer-oriented model, or something in between? I don’t think we know the answer yet.” Not everything in China is stacked against multinationals, some of which may well have engaged in questionable practices and often have their own political allies and business partners. Nor is China the only country where Microsoft and other companies have faced consumer ire and regulatory scrutiny. But multinationals appear to be facing new and substantial challenges in navigating a clutch of separate regulatory agencies across China, each keen to amass victories, and the fines and political kudos that go with them.
business/international,“China has a very large bureaucracy, but each agency has its incentives and missions, so when they enforce the law, they try to maximize their own interests,” said Angela Zhang, a lecturer in law at King’s College London, who studies Chinese antimonopoly law. “But I wouldn’t underestimate the power of some really large multinational companies, because these companies are also very deep-pocketed and have very good connections in China, and they can also do the lobbying.” For now, though, Microsoft; the San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm; Daimler, the German auto giant; and other formidable companies are on the defensive. Over the last couple of years, the government agencies empowered with enforcing China’s antimonopoly law have increased their investigations of both domestic and foreign companies. The foreign companies cover sectors such as technology, car parts, pharmaceuticals, jewelry retailing and food packaging. Over the last few weeks, investigators have been particularly busy — and particularly public — in their efforts, setting a pattern of making abrupt searches of foreign companies’ offices. These are then reported by local media, tersely confirmed by the companies and followed by the government declaring that the companies are suspected of violating pricing, distribution and bundling rules, harming Chinese businesses and consumers. Last Wednesday, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, or S.A.I.C., conducted a follow-up raid on two Microsoft offices in China and searched Accenture’s offices in the northeastern city of Dalian. Last week, officials at the National Development and Reform Commission searched the Shanghai offices of Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz cars, and said they planned to fine Chrysler and Audi.
business/international,The reform commission enforces pricing violations of China’s antimonopoly law and has been investigating how automakers price the spare parts that are sold by their distributors in China. In response to the investigation, BMW said on Friday that it would lower parts prices in China. Similar component price cuts have been made recently by Mercedes and Audi. The reform commission is one of three agencies with a role in enforcing the antimonopoly law, which includes rules against unfair pricing and sales restrictions, even when a company has plenty of competitors. The Ministry of Commerce vets domestic and overseas mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they don’t give any one company dominance over the market for a particular good or service in the country. The ministry has expanded the number of deals it examines — reaching decisions on 207 cases last year, an increase of 26 percent from 2012, and imposing significant conditions on those transactions. Alongside the commerce ministry, S.A.I.C. and the reform commission have taken on a higher profile in antimonopoly cases since last year. The commission in August of last year fined six companies that sell infant milk powder a total of $109 million, accusing them of price fixing and anticompetitive behavior. Five of the companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition of the United States, were foreign and the other was based in Hong Kong. Qualcomm has also been subject to an antimonopoly investigation by the reform commission since at least late last year, as have dozens of foreign pharmaceutical companies.
business/international,S.A.I.C., which investigates cases not directly related to pricing, started its own investigation a year ago into abuse of market position by Tetra Pak, a giant food packaging company based in Sweden. Analysts say foreign companies may be relatively more vulnerable to investigation because they generally lack the deep networks of political patronage that prevail in many sectors of China’s economy, particularly those like energy and finance that remain state-dominated. “As Beijing prunes back outdated forms of government intervention, regulations to protect consumers and promote competition must come to the fore, which is why President Xi scoped this into his reform design,” said Daniel H. Rosen, the founding partner of the Rhodium Group, an economic and political consulting firm in New York. “It does seem that foreign firms are the subject of a disproportionate share of China’s new enthusiasm for competition policy.” But the enforcers, too, appear to be feeling the pressure from shifts in Chinese economic policy making. The powerful National Development and Reform Commission has traditionally been China’s top economic planning agency and remains responsible for setting the retail prices that state energy companies like PetroChina and Sinopec can charge for products like gasoline. But its influence has waned under Mr. Xi, who has shifted the oversight of some economic policies to newly established committees that he heads. Shoring up influence through enforcement of antimonopoly rules may help the agency compensate for that change.
business/international,Ms. Zhang, the law lecturer, noted that while antitrust cases involving foreign companies tend to grab the headlines, authorities have in many instances also gone after local and state-owned companies. To date, the biggest such case was in February 2013, when the reform commission slapped total price-fixing fines of 449 million renminbi, or about $73 million, on two of China’s leading state-owned liquor companies: Wuliangye Yibin Group and Kweichow Moutai. Among foreign companies, few would appear to be better connected in China than Microsoft. Its co-founder, Bill Gates, has met with Mr. Xi several times to discuss the charitable work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and he hosted Mr. Xi’s predecessor, President Hu Jintao, at a 2006 dinner at his home in Medina, Wash. Since then, however, the Chinese government’s wariness of Western technology providers has deepened, especially after Edward J. Snowden’s disclosures about surveillance done by the United States. It is not clear to Microsoft executives precisely how the Chinese authorities believe that they violated the country’s antimonopoly law. For months, Microsoft was in private discussions over competition issues with S.A.I.C. officials. The discussions were not hostile, said one person briefed on the meetings who spoke on condition of anonymity. So it was a surprise to Microsoft executives when investigators raided its offices. S.A.I.C. officials have said publicly that the investigation is related to software compatibility, bundling and file verification issues for Windows and Office.
business/international,Late last week, The People’s Daily, the chief newspaper of the party, told foreign companies to get used to tougher scrutiny. “In the future, the focus on market order will continue to be constantly enhanced,” it said. “Every kind of business should adjust its behavior and thinking to this new regulatory normal.”
science,A Birder’s Heaven: Just Follow the Stench to the Landfill - The New York Times Bulldozers push around refuse. Machinery rumbles and beeps. Trucks barrel past. All the while, birds call out like flocks of screaming children. Welcome to the Brevard County Central Disposal Facility in Cocoa, Fla. — a birder’s paradise. “I had no idea,” said Joel Reynolds, a retiree, birder and wildlife photographer who learned about the unlikely appeal of this landfill just a few years ago. “I just thought it was a stinky, smelly place.” Popular pit stops for migrating gulls and an easy bite for local birds, the Brevard landfill and other landfills become mess halls for thousands of avian diners, especially in the winter. The Brevard site has become a part of the Space Coast Birding and Wildlife Festival’s annual events. If you’re headed to Florida, the festival kicked off this week and runs to Monday. But there are plenty more opportunities in other places to scurry over piles of sharp objects and maggot-infested mystery mush to catch a glimpse of some of the exotic flying things that are drawn to landfills. If that sounds like fun, consider this your guide to dirty birding. First, call to see if the local landfill allows visitors. If it does, you will probably take a safety class and sign a release. Don’t just show up or sneak in: Some landfills have kicked birding groups out for breaking their rules or disrupting their work.
science,Wear boots, long pants and a hat. You will have to learn to ignore the stench, and bring a change of clothes for those at home who can’t. To spot highfliers, carry a pair of binoculars or a telescope. Expect a lot of birds. In Florida, birders have spotted white ibis, cattle egrets, eagles, herons, wood storks and cranes. But the landfills there are best known for gulls of many species from all over the East Coast. There are fairly significant numbers of lesser black-backed gulls, a European bird that has showed up in the United States in the last few decades. Right now a project is banding and tracking them to find out their origin. “We do not where these birds are coming from despite the fact that there are thousands,” said Michael Brothers, a manager at the Marine Science Center in Ponce Inlet, Fla. Go when the birds go. The best day is garbage day, because some birds know the trucks driving in carry the good stuff for foraging. Their presence, and sometimes rodents, also attracts winged predators like eagles that see landfills as prime hunting ground. “You can see the birds streaming from their evening roost towards the landfill,” Mr. Brothers said. Some even roost at the landfills. If you won’t be in Florida, there are plenty of other landfill birding opportunities. Some favorites are in St. John’s in Newfoundland; Assam, India; near San Diego; and in Brownsville, Tex., known by birders as the only reliable place in the United States to spot the Tamaulipas crow, a Mexican bird with a very limited range.
science,For New Yorkers, the best bet is a landfill in Tullytown, Pa., said Tom Stephenson, a member of the Brooklyn Bird Club and author of a popular Warbler guide. He recommends referring to the Cornell Ornithology Lab’s e-bird database while planning a trip. You can plug in where you want to go and see if the birds that have been spotted there are worth holding back your gag reflex. But if you would rather see restored nature, with a lot less odor, visit a capped landfill. Freshkills Park on Staten Island used to have mountains of trash as high as buildings. It has since been converted into a park with grasslands, wetlands and a totally different ecology from the one it served as an active landfill. The park’s planners hope that birds that are threatened by habitat loss, like short-eared owls, will seek refuge in these restored habitats. Researchers are working to monitor which birds show up there, and tours go on all year. But don’t dismiss active landfills just because they smell rotten. “Some of the best places to see birds are places most humans don’t go,” Mr. Stephenson said.
world/europe,Migrant Crimes Add Volatile Element to Austria’s Election - The New York Times VIENNA — By any measure, the string of crimes has been terrible. A grandmother of three, walking her dog, raped along a riverbank. A 10-year-old boy sexually assaulted at a public swimming pool. A 21-year-old student gang raped near the giant Ferris wheel at Vienna’s famed Prater park. A 54-year-old woman beaten to death on the street. The fact that the crimes were committed by recent migrants from war zones and an immigrant who had lived illegally in the country for years added an especially volatile element to the political climate ahead of the presidential election on Sunday, when Austria could become the first European country to elect a far-right candidate as head of state since the end of Nazism. Nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment had already been whipped up by the surge of refugees who streamed into Austria last year. Now, the assaults and the coverage of them in the tabloid press could help the far-right presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer of the Austria’s Freedom Party, in what appears to be a tight race against Alexander Van der Bellen, a former Green Party leader. The Freedom Party has assailed crime and migrants for years, but the backlash against the latest influx of asylum seekers has been especially fierce in this election season. Chancellor Werner Faymann, the leader of the coalition government, was forced out on May 9 after the two centrist parties that have dominated Austria for decades were trounced in the first round of presidential voting.
world/europe,Sunday’s runoff between Mr. Hofer and Mr. Van der Bellen could turn on concerns that the country’s leaders lost control under the tide of refugees and migrants who reached Europe last year. At least 90,000 people applied for asylum in this country of 8.4 million before Austria’s government shut its borders and persuaded all the Balkan states, through which the migrants trekked from Greece, to follow suit. Since then, the challenges of integrating the refugees have become clearer as concerns about crime, sexual mores and cultural clashes come into stark relief across Europe, highlighted by the New Year’s Eve assaults on German women by Arab or North African men in Cologne. A link between the increased numbers of asylum seekers in the country and any rise in sexual assaults and other crimes has not been established statistically, the Interior Ministry and the Vienna police say. Over all, the agencies said, crime has declined in the Austrian capital over the past decade. The number of criminal offenses nationwide also declined, to 417,000 in 2015 from 427,000 in 2014, although a slight rise was recorded in the first quarter of this year, the Interior Ministry said. But especially grim acts, starting with the rape of the grandmother in September, have been hashed over with increasing intensity, feeding the anti-migrant sentiment that helped propel Mr. Hofer to first place in the first round last month.
world/europe,“Is it just a feeling? Or actually the shocking reality?” the biggest-circulation daily, Kronen Zeitung, asked in early May, reporting on sex crimes and robberies in three Austrian cities. The newspaper asserted that women increasingly fear some public spaces, and questioned whether “one really cannot detect a trend in the statistics.” Sylvia Bubits, 54, is living the conflicts dividing Austria. She is a longtime resident of Traiskirchen, the town just south of Vienna that hosts Austria’s largest center for refugees. Displaced people first arrived from the conflicts of the Cold War, then from the Balkans and now from the Middle East and beyond. Ms. Bubits is also the daughter of the woman, now 72, who was raped while walking her dog on Sept. 1. Since the attack, Ms. Bubits said, her mother has gone from being healthy to ridden with anxiety and requiring close attention. “It goes up and down,” Ms. Bubits said, but “it’s basically as if she was suddenly 90.” On a visit to her home on Friday, her mother could barely shuffle a few steps without assistance. Ms. Bubits said she and her mother wanted to speak out about what had happened to emphasize that despite the problems many Austrians want to help refugees and make a place for them in their country. According to court documents, her mother was walking her 13-year-old dog by the Schwechat, a river where refugees and residents often bathe. A young man helped her up a slope, but then, the documents said, “exploited her physical weakness,” threw her to the ground, “held her mouth shut, ripped her clothes and forced her to engage” in sex.
world/europe,Despite the assault on her mother and an earlier attack in which, she said, her 22-year-old son’s nose was broken by refugees, Ms. Bubits said she remained a firm advocate for migrants. She cried with joy when she saw two 17-year-old Afghans she helped last year at a reunion at a local cafe. “There are two sides to this question,” she said of Austria’s coping with refugees, stressing that she believes integration can work. The man accused of attacking her mother, an Afghan who was caught some weeks later, denied his actions until D.N.A. evidence identified him. He then asserted that he had drunk a bottle of vodka beforehand and could remember little. Prosecutors said he had recalled details that only a perpetrator could have known. At a trial in January, Judge Petra Harbich sentenced the man, who says he was born on Jan. 1, 1998, meaning he was a minor when he committed the crime, to 20 months in jail for the rape and stealing a pack of cigarettes. That sentence, while in line with treatment of minors in Austria, was ridiculed by one of Ms. Bubis’s lawyers, Dietmar Heck, as too mild. Mr. Heck’s practice has also taken on the case of the 54-year-old woman, identified in Austria only as Maria E., who was bludgeoned to death by a homeless Kenyan man at 2:30 a.m. on May 4 outside the 24-hour sports betting shop in Vienna where she worked as a cleaner.
world/europe,It has emerged that legal, bureaucratic and diplomatic hurdles prevented the police and state prosecutors from detaining or deporting the Kenyan. He is now 21 but came to Austria as a teenager to rejoin his mother, who still lives here. The man had been detained more than a dozen times and convicted at least twice for drug dealing and other crimes. When he assaulted the cleaner, the police had requested his detention on grounds of mental instability. A 14-member commission is investigating the case, which has fed calls for a tougher approach to foreigners who some Austrians say do not belong in the country. Other Austrians worry that politicians are effectively asking the legal system to tackle questions that judges, lawyers and police cannot answer. “It is all getting whipped up politically,” said Martin Mahrer, a lawyer who is defending one of three young Afghans who have confessed to raping a female Turkish student in a park on April 22. “People now want offenders to be really severely punished.” Mr. Mahrer said some of these young migrants had arrived from war zones, with completely un-Western views about women. “They do not respect the same things we do,” Mr. Mahrer said. But, he asked, are foreign offenders less equal before the law than Austrians? William Spindler, a spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, noted that most newly arrived refugees do not commit crimes.
world/europe,“There are many examples of Afghans adapting very well to the West,” he said when asked about men from Afghanistan who are unused to seeing women alone in public, or consuming alcohol. If crimes are committed, individuals should be held to account, Mr. Spindler added. He suggested that any group of people contained potential criminals and said the large number of arrivals last year meant that the total of such individuals could run into the hundreds for any country’s migrants. A measure of how widespread calls for “zero tolerance” have become came in the last TV debate between the two presidential candidates. Mr. Van der Bellen said episodes like the assaults on women in Cologne required a tough response “because that is an attempt to occupy a certain public space, and that we won’t countenance.”
us/politics,Supreme Court Deals Blow to Obama’s Efforts to Regulate Coal Emissions - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  In a major setback for President Obama’s climate change agenda, the Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily blocked the administration’s effort to combat global warming by regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants. The brief order was not the last word on the case, which is most likely to return to the Supreme Court after an appeals court considers an expedited challenge from 29 states and dozens of corporations and industry groups. But the Supreme Court’s willingness to issue a stay while the case proceeds was an early hint that the program could face a skeptical reception from the justices. The 5-to-4 vote, with the court’s four liberal members dissenting, was unprecedented — the Supreme Court had never before granted a request to halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court. “It’s a stunning development,” Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former environmental legal counsel to the Obama administration, said in an email. She added that “the order certainly indicates a high degree of initial judicial skepticism from five justices on the court,” and that the ruling would raise serious questions from nations that signed on to the landmark Paris climate change pact in December. In negotiating that deal, which requires every country to enact policies to lower emissions, Mr. Obama pointed to the power plant rule as evidence that the United States would take ambitious action, and that other countries should follow.
us/politics,The White House said in a statement that it disagreed with the court’s decision and remained confident that it would ultimately prevail. “The administration will continue to take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions,” it said. Opponents of Mr. Obama’s climate policy called the court’s action historic. “We are thrilled that the Supreme Court realized the rule’s immediate impact and froze its implementation, protecting workers and saving countless dollars as our fight against its legality continues,” said Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, which has led the 29-state legal challenge. “There’s a lot of people who are celebrating,” said Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with Bracewell & Giuliani, a firm representing energy companies, which are party to the lawsuit. “It sends a pretty strong signal that ultimately it’s pretty likely to be invalidated.” The challenged regulation, which was issued last summer by the Environmental Protection Agency, requires states to make major cuts to greenhouse gas pollution created by electric power plants, the nation’s largest source of such emissions. The plan could transform the nation’s electricity system, cutting emissions from existing power plants by a third by 2030, from a 2005 baseline, by closing hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired plants and increasing production of wind and solar power. “Climate change is the most significant environmental challenge of our day, and it is already affecting national public health, welfare and the environment,” Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote in a brief urging the Supreme Court to reject a request for a stay while the case moves forward.
us/politics,The regulation calls for states to submit compliance plans by September, though they may seek a two-year extension. The first deadline for power plants to reduce their emissions is in 2022, with full compliance not required until 2030. The states challenging the regulation, led mostly by Republicans and many with economies that rely on coal mining or coal-fired power, sued to stop what they called “the most far-reaching and burdensome rule the E.P.A. has ever forced onto the states.” A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January unanimously refused to grant a stay. The court did expedite the case and will hear arguments on June 2, which is fast by the standards of complex litigation. The states urged the Supreme Court to take immediate action to block what they called a “power grab” under which “the federal environmental regulator seeks to reorganize the energy grids in nearly every state in the nation.” Though the first emission reduction obligations do not take effect until 2022, the states said they had already started to spend money and shift resources. Eighteen states, mostly led by Democrats, opposed the request for a stay, saying they were “continuing to experience climate-change harms firsthand — including increased flooding, more severe storms, wildfires and droughts.” Those harms are “lasting and irreversible,” they said, and “any stay that results in further delay in emissions reductions would compound the harms.”
us/politics,In a second filing seeking a stay, coal companies and trade associations represented by Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, said the court should act to stop a “targeted attack on the coal industry” that will “artificially eliminate buyers of coal, forcing the coal industry to curtail production, idle operations, lay off workers and close mines.” The E.P.A., represented by Mr. Verrilli, called the requests for a stay “extraordinary and unprecedented.” The states challenging the administration’s plan, he said, could point to no case in which the Supreme Court had “granted a stay of a generally applicable regulation pending initial judicial review in the court of appeals.” In a later brief, the states conceded that point. Mr. Verrilli said judicial review of the plan, including by the Supreme Court, will be complete before the first deadline for emissions reductions in 2022. “There is no reason to suppose that states’ duties under the rule will be especially onerous,” Mr. Verrilli wrote. “A state can elect not to prepare a plan at all, but instead may allow E.P.A. to develop and implement a federal plan for sources in that state.” The two sides differed about whether current declines in coal mining and coal-fired power generation are attributable to the administration’s plan. “Some of the nation’s largest coal companies have declared bankruptcy, due in no small part to the rule,” a group of utilities told the justices. A coalition of environmental groups and companies that produce and rely on wind and solar power said other factors were to blame for coal’s decline.
us/politics,“These changes include the abundant supply of relatively inexpensive natural gas, the increasing cost-competitiveness of electricity from renewable generation sources such as solar and wind power, the deployment of low-cost energy efficiency and other demand-side measures, and increasing consumer demand for advanced energy,” they wrote.

arts/music,Paul Tollett Discusses His Latest Project, Panorama Music Festival - The New York Times This weekend, the Panorama festival will make its debut on Randalls Island with LCD Soundsystem, Kendrick Lamar, Arcade Fire, Alabama Shakes and a few dozen other acts, as well as a high-tech exhibition space designed for visual dazzle. The event, which has a capacity of about 40,000 for each of its three days, is not expected to sell out. But Paul Tollett, the promoter of Panorama — and a star in the clubby concert world as the mastermind behind Coachella — is not worried. “We’re not going to get there,” he said. “That’s totally fine.” Mr. Tollett declined to specify how many tickets Panorama has sold so far, but its performance will be closely watched as a bellwether for what has quickly become a hypercompetitive festival market in New York. Governors Ball, which began five years ago as a modest one-day event put on by three 20-somethings, has become a nationally known festival luring stars like Kanye West and the Strokes to Randalls Island, and this year it was acquired by Live Nation Entertainment, the global concert giant. Panorama is part of the portfolio of AEG Live, the corporate rival of Live Nation, and the competition between the two mega-promoters is in some ways a symbolic showdown for the concert business, which is now dominated by big festivals across the country. One sign of the stakes? Panorama’s arrival led to a lobbying war over the last year that resulted in the festival’s being blocked from its intended home at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.
arts/music,In an interview, Mr. Tollett discussed Panorama’s plans, including its embrace of technology through the Lab, an interactive exhibition space at the center of the festival that is being presented with HP and The Verge, the technology news website. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation. Why does New York need another music festival? It’s a big city. In the Los Angeles area, you probably have 250,000 or 300,000 people going to music festivals, between Coachella, FYF and others. I’m talking about the nonelectronic ones. In Chicago, you’ve got 100,000. You get to New York, there are maybe 40,000. That’s the biggest city in America. Some people might think that New York doesn’t need festivals. But London is just as cool as New York, and probably a million people go to festivals there, if you count Glastonbury, Reading, Wireless, Hyde Park. It’s big numbers. If someone is going to go to one music festival this summer, how do you convince him or her to go to Panorama? This year? That hasn’t really been the focus. We haven’t really been out there begging in the marketing. We’re just throwing it out there and letting people experience it, and hopefully it will build over the years. That sounds like a very Californian attitude toward marketing a festival. What I mean is that people need to experience the show. We have some things that we’re bringing in that are really going to turn heads, like the technology.
arts/music,We have this thing called the Lab. It’s a very large dome inside where technology exhibits are going to be. There’s a lady named Emilie Baltz who has the Cotton Candy Theremin. It projects onto the dome, and it’s interacting with sound and visuals. People are going to see that and think, “I want to see that each year.” You had originally planned for Panorama to be held at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park this year, but that was blocked after a lot of behind-the-scenes lobbying by your competitors. We were going to be at the World’s Fair site, and that was the theme, with tech unveilings and things of that nature. We moved over to Randalls, but we still have that, scaled back, of course. I think it’s going to be different from any festival around the country. New York in general is just higher-end — you’ve got to wow the people of New York. Do you have to dramatically change what you do for an urban setting? The crowd is not going to be there for three days, sleeping over. The majority of people have bought single-day tickets. So we’ve got to make sure that if you go for one day, you get the whole feeling. Your other new event, Desert Trip, has the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Roger Waters and the Who. Is that what you have to do to make a music festival stand out in 2016?
arts/music,No. That is a unique, one-off thing. It’s not really a festival — it’s a concert, two bands a day. I just thought those six bands should play together. It’s never been done. It turned out to be the highest-grossing show by far. It beat No. 2, which is Coachella, by far. The gross is approximately $160 million for the two weekends. Will it be profitable, given the talent and the production costs? We’ll find out in October. But that was the intent, yes. You sound as if you have the luxury of being patient with these festivals. I read these press releases from all festivals, “This is going to refine, this is going to be the best,” blah blah blah. They all sound so cocky. I understand you’re trying to sell, but it just sounds like everyone is bragging. Instead of all of us bragging, we should probably just do our shows and let people see if they have a good time. In my opinion, if you go to Panorama, you’re going to have a good time, and you’re going to want to come back. That doesn’t take away from any other festival in New York, because they’re fun, too. I just think hundreds of thousands of people should be going to festivals in New York.
world/asia,Chinese Security Laws Elevate the Party and Stifle Dissent. Mao Would Approve. - The New York Times BEIJING — China’s new national security law, released in draft form this month, has little to say about such traditional security matters as military power, counterespionage or defending the nation’s borders. Instead, to the surprise and alarm of many people here, it reads more like a Communist Party ideology paper and a call to arms aimed at defending the party’s grip on power. The law, together with two other recently published draft laws, constitutes the most expansive articulation yet of President Xi Jinping’s vision of national security, and the widest interpretation of threats to the Communist Party and the state since the Mao era. Analysts say the laws are aimed at giving the security forces and courts greater leeway in muzzling Chinese civil society and corralling the influence of Western institutions and ideas, which Mr. Xi views as a threat. Deploying the kind of retro-nationalist language that has become standard fare under Mr. Xi, the national security law says security must be maintained in all aspects of society, from culture to education to technology, “to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” “This draft focuses on politics, ideology and culture,” said Zhang Xuezhong, a civil rights lawyer and former law professor at East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai. The two other draft laws — also related to what might be described as ideological security — are a so-called counterterrorism law and one aimed at controlling the activities of foreign nongovernmental organizations and their Chinese partners.
world/asia,More than at any other time since the Communists seized power in 1949, some scholars say, the law is being used in the service of ideology and maintaining party survival. The draft laws, Mr. Zhang said, “really look like an expression of the conservative political thinking of some party leaders, and the legislative organs are merely trying to realize their thoughts.” Perhaps the most interesting question is why Mr. Xi thinks he needs such laws. Existing laws already enshrine Communist Party power and criminalize any act deemed to encourage “subversion of state power.” But the new laws provide a firmer legal framework for controlling civil society and Western organizations, scholars say. The most ambitious of the three, the national security law, solidifies Mr. Xi’s authority over national security by placing a central organ — likely to be the National Security Commission that Mr. Xi founded — in charge of all security matters. An April 23 article in People’s Daily, the official party newspaper, said the new draft of the security law reflected “General Secretary Xi Jinping’s spirit.” Another reason Mr. Xi wants these laws is more abstract, scholars say. Party ideology no longer plays a central role in the lives of ordinary Chinese the way it did in the Mao era, so the party needs to promote and institutionalize the ideology by whatever means it can, including by writing it into law. That is especially true under Mr. Xi, who since the day he took office in 2012 has promoted old-school party ideology in a way not seen since the aftermath of the June 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
world/asia,“The ideology is far thinner and holds the attention of the populace far less powerfully than before,” said Stanley B. Lubman, a scholar of Chinese law at the University of California, Berkeley. “As a result, the Chinese Communist Party needs more institutional support than before, and may need even more. This helps to explain the attention that law has recently been receiving since Xi came to power.” The national security law explicitly mentions the need to teach China’s 1.3 billion people about the security and ideological needs of the state and the party. One clause commands institutions to “strengthen guidance on news, propaganda and public opinion about national security.” “National security education will be included in the national education system and the public-servant training system to strengthen awareness among the entire populace,” the law says. “April 15 of each year will be set aside as national security education day.” Legal analysts say the law is expected to be passed no later than March, when the National People’s Congress is to meet in Beijing. It could be passed sooner by the legislature’s standing committee, which also has the power to approve laws. “I think the frame of the national security law fits the current needs of the nation, since national security as a concept has expanded to more areas,” said Tong Zhiwei, a professor at the East China University of Political Science and Law. “But I don’t agree with some of the wordings in the draft — for example the phrases ‘ideological security’ and ‘cultural security.’ ”
world/asia,Ideology and culture are not threats to national security, Mr. Tong added. Mr. Zhang, the lawyer, said the law was “destined to be abused.” With its sanction, he said, “law enforcement officials who want to suppress freedom of speech or set limits on importing foreign publications will be more confident in doing so.” The two other draft laws have even more concrete provisions for controlling civil society and Western institutions; both could be passed as early as this summer. The foreign NGO law proposes that such organizations be registered and regulated by the Public Security Ministry, a step that William Nee, a China researcher with Amnesty International, equates to treating them “as potential criminals.” The law would apply to all nonprofit groups, including schools and artistic organizations. Even those groups with no China operations but who want to hold an event here would have to register with the police. Before registering, foreign NGOs would have to find an official sponsor. To get official backing and to win the approval of the security ministry, the NGOs would have to drop or severely curtail activities that officials might consider politically suspect, like those aimed at helping China build an independent judicial system, for example. In addition, funding given by foreign NGOs to “more outspoken” Chinese NGOs would “rapidly dry up,” leading to the shutdown of many of those groups, wrote Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch. Ms. Wang said the law would affect her group’s activities.
world/asia,The separate draft counterterrorism law calls for, among other things, foreign technology and financial companies to hand over encryption keys to Chinese agencies and install security back doors in technology. President Obama and other American officials are pressing Chinese leaders to drop those requirements. During his tenure, Mr. Xi has repeatedly cited Han Feizi, a Legalist philosopher from the Warring States period more than 23 centuries ago. The Legalists said autocratic rule should be codified in law rather than having law limit that rule. A party conference in October laid the foundation for the party’s use of the law to justify and reinforce its rule. The conference called for policies promoting “the Socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics.” Legal scholars say the party is appropriating the term “rule of law” for propaganda purposes with no intention of allowing the law to circumscribe the party’s authority. Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University, said Mr. Xi’s “rule of law seems also a vehicle for strengthening the control of central authority over the unruly lower levels of government and all the distorting influences that impact local court decision-making.” On a broader level, he said, “Xi has intensified the uses of legislation and judicial practice as instruments of party ideology and policy in order to impose a more repressive regime than China has witnessed since the June 4 era.”

us/politics,Democrats Search for a Response After Charlottesville Violence - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats, eager to capitalize on President Trump’s unpopular response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., are pursuing a potpourri of messages and legislative actions, trying to find a comeback that could buoy them ahead of next year’s midterm elections. On Thursday, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, published a lengthy opinion article calling on his party to focus on voting rights, and particularly on a legislative push to disband Mr. Trump’s “election integrity” panel, which Mr. Schumer called a “ruse” intended only “to disenfranchise voters.” The Democratic National Committee is pressing a broad activist campaign to rally supporters under the banner #RiseAndOrganize, but just what they are to rise against is unclear. The committee held more than 200 events this past weekend around the campaign. Then there is Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has focused much of his energy on legislation that would remove Confederate statues from the Capitol. And some House Democrats who are demanding a formal censure of the president. With control of neither the White House nor a chamber of Congress, all of these separate efforts threaten to dilute a unified message and keep Democrats sidelined from the debates sparked by Charlottesville. Some even question why so much attention is being paid to identity politics after Democrats lost an election to a presidential candidate who focused on populist economics.
us/politics,“I totally understand the passion of those who want to bring those statues down, but Democrats cannot lose focus on the overriding issue of midterm elections, which is building the middle class back up,” said Steve Israel, a recently retired House Democrat who chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “The midterm elections need to be a referendum on whether President Trump has delivered to a middle class that has been pummeled.” Jess O’Connell, the chief executive of the Democratic National Committee, disagreed and said the party must “operate on all levels.” “If we learned anything over the past few months, we know that silence is not an option,” she said. “We have to hold Republicans accountable, not just President Trump, but Republicans who remain silent.” Democratic leaders argue that all of their efforts are consistent with the twin goals of civil rights and economic rights, while they work to hold Mr. Trump accountable for saying that there were “some very fine people on both sides” of the unrest in Virginia. Ms. O’Connell said that the Democratic Party must stand against the Confederate statues and focus on the problems that face voters daily, like health care and jobs. The Rise and Organize campaign has rallied Democrats to knock on doors and call people to encourage them to participate in electoral politics. “People are still asking us about health care. They’re asking us about the economy and about how to raise wages,” Ms. O’Connell said. “And those are the things that we are working on as well.”
us/politics,But so vague is the slogan #RiseAndOrganize that supporters of Robert James Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock, are using it on Twitter to rally conservatives around the Michigan Republican’s possible Senate campaign. On the left, activists have used it for anti-racism programs, for trying to stop the Dakota Access pipeline and for voter registration. Republicans say all of this only underscores the president’s contention that Democrats have become the party of obstructionism, blocking progress on overhauling the tax code, on building a wall on the southern border and on reviving the nation’s infrastructure. In his opinion article, Mr. Schumer called for a concentrated focus on Mr. Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas’ hard-line conservative secretary of state, Kris Kobach. “This is how the appalling failure to use the right words and stand up to hate in the aftermath of Charlottesville is made real in the form of policy; they are two edges of the same sword,” Mr. Schumer wrote of racism and the commission. “Under the guise of voter fraud, which experts agree is practically non-existent, conservative forces in the administration, cheered on by white-supremacy-stoking publications like Breitbart News, are reviving the old playbook of disenfranchising minority voters.” Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said that Ms. Pelosi also wants to see the commission disbanded, but that she is also pushing to have Congress censure the president, hold congressional hearings on white supremacists and make the case to voters that Democrats will do more to help the middle class.
us/politics,“One can do all of these things,” Mr. Hammill said. “Those things are not mutually exclusive.” Joseph Pinion III, a Republican strategist, warned that Democrats may get too caught up in fighting “cosmetic” racism and symbols. Mr. Pinion said that, as an African-American, he wants to see Confederate symbols gone and the president’s election commission disbanded. But, he said, Democrats need to look at why they lost the 2016 presidential election. “The truth is the Democratic Party to this day, in the wake of Hillary Clinton, has gone about absolving itself of any wrongdoing,” he said. “That is the easiest thing to do and also the most dangerous thing to do.” Until Democrats learn to communicate beyond an activist base to a greater American public, he added, “they are still going to be going nowhere fast.”
world/middleeast,U.N. Warns of Polio Risk in War Zones - The New York Times
nyregion,Alberto Carvalho Backs Out of New York City Schools Job - The New York Times MIAMI — It was supposed to be a triumphant moment for Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City school system. The mayor had lured away one of the nation’s most successful educators to become the city’s new schools chancellor. Then, in less than 24 hours, triumph turned to embarrassment when the official, Alberto M. Carvalho, abruptly — even impulsively, in his own telling — changed his mind and renounced the job during a dramatic spectacle broadcast live on television Thursday. Mr. Carvalho, the superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, made his announcement before his school board in Miami, leading to cheers in the packed meeting room and fury and confusion in New York City. “I am breaking an agreement,” Mr. Carvalho said. “I shall remain in Miami-Dade as your superintendent.” His words came during a special board meeting that turned into a three-and-a-half-hour exhibition of supporters begging him to stay. Mr. Carvalho began with a speech tantalizing the crowd with hints he might leave, then interrupted his remarks to speak privately by telephone with Mayor de Blasio before coming back and delivering the news. It was an embarrassing turn of events for the de Blasio administration, which appeared to be caught off guard and at first reacted with anger. “Who would ever hire this guy again?” Eric Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, said on Twitter. “Who would ever vote for him?”
nyregion,Mr. de Blasio, not 24 hours earlier, had called the superintendent “the best person to lead the nation’s largest school system into the future.” The pick seemed almost too good to be true — and, apparently, it was. Mr. Carvalho came to the United States from Portugal at 17 and overstayed his visa. He said he was homeless for a time and had slept in a friend’s U-Haul. He became a physics teacher, then rose up the ranks in Miami-Dade education. A charismatic presence, he speaks at least four languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish and French. He seemed well poised to hone Mr. de Blasio’s education agenda and pitch it to the public. It did not work out that way. Bafflement over what prompted his sudden about-face lingered throughout the day. New Yorkers — including Mr. de Blasio — grappled with how Mr. Carvalho could have so abruptly changed his mind, turning down one of the most prestigious and high-profile jobs in education more than a week after accepting it. “My first response was just profound surprise,” the mayor said at a news conference on Thursday. As late as an 8 p.m. call on Wednesday, he said, “All systems were go.” Mr. de Blasio added, “He told me repeatedly this was his dream job.” Mr. Carvalho gave little explanation except to describe an emotional decision driven in part by phone conversations with two students who were undocumented immigrants. They told him, “I don’t know what my future will look like if you leave,” he said. “If I were to leave those two, I’m probably leaving everything I believe in.”
nyregion,In Miami, where he has flirted with running for Congress, he was an influential figure with broad appeal. The day’s love fest was a clear reminder of that, and in Miami-Dade County the school chief has greater prominence than in New York. People in Miami who have followed his career wondered whether being thrust into the glare of the New York media, and the prospect of close scrutiny, had dampened his enthusiasm. Ten years ago, Mr. Carvalho was involved in a scandal in which leaked emails led to speculation he was having an affair with a reporter who covered education. Mr. Carvalho’s spokeswoman in Miami said that had no bearing on his decision. New York City is the largest school system in the country, with 1.1 million students and a budget of $30 billion, larger than the gross domestic product of some countries. Nonetheless, many educators and observers warned that Mr. de Blasio might have a difficult time attracting top talent to continue the work of Carmen Fariña, who plans to retire as chancellor, rather than someone with the freedom to cut a bold new vision. She was expected to stay through March. Thursday’s spectacle is likely to make replacing her that much more difficult. “How embarrassing!” said George Arzt, a veteran political consultant who was a press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch. “In the past there are people who have pulled out of jobs they’ve been appointed to, but I don’t remember any job as prominent as schools chancellor. But it’s certainly shocking, and they have to renew their search and find someone very quickly.”
nyregion,Mr. Arzt added, “The problem is that the new person will be viewed as the second choice.” The courtship of Mr. Carvalho went on for more than a month. Mr. Phillips said Mr. Carvalho met with the mayor twice at Gracie Mansion, once in January and once in February. Mr. de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, who routinely participates in City Hall hiring decisions, was deeply involved in the interview process as well. Mr. Carvalho told Mr. de Blasio that he would take the job last week, Mr. Phillips said, and it seemed that the matchmaking had ended. But an announcement was postponed at least once when Mr. Carvalho said that he could not leave his district because of gun scares and jitters in the aftermath of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which is in a neighboring district. Mr. Phillips said an announcement was scheduled for Monday and then scratched, and the same for Thursday. On Wednesday, the news media in New York were told that Mr. Carvalho would be the new chancellor. Mr. de Blasio said that Mr. Carvalho agreed that City Hall could give word of the announcement to the news site Politico. But officials in Miami warned caution, saying that he had not made a public statement yet, so perhaps it was not final. A measure of panic began to set in at New York’s City Hall on Wednesday night, after the initial news reports and indications that Mr. Carvalho appeared to be getting cold feet, according to someone familiar with the matter. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations in City Hall.
nyregion,Late into the evening, phone calls went back and forth between New York and Miami. At one point, at least one senior administration official spoke by phone with Mr. Carvalho, who reiterated the promise he had made about taking the job, according to the person. Mr. Carvalho did not suggest he was backing out of the job on Wednesday, the person said, but instead offered logistical and other reasons for remaining in Florida that day. At Thursday’s board meeting in Miami, speaker after speaker lavished praise on Mr. Carvalho for preventing budget cuts to the arts, advocating on behalf of immigrants and stabilizing a school district that before his tenure had been notorious for political upheaval. After bathing in more than two hours of praise, Mr. Carvalho spoke, and then he asked for several breaks. As he disappeared off the stage for a few moments, the crowd in the room, which had been resigned to his leaving, started to wonder whether he might stay. Those breaks turned out to be attempts to speak to Mr. de Blasio. He eventually reached him. The conversation, Mr. Carvalho said, was not easy. “This is probably the second most difficult thing I’ve ever done in my life. The very first one was to leave my country,” he said. “I am breaking an agreement between adults to honor an agreement and a pact I have with the children of Miami.” In Florida, the audience roared. In New York City, mouths dropped.
nyregion,Mr. Carvalho left the dais to a mob of well-wishers who offered him hugs, handshakes and kisses on the cheek. As theatrical it was, this was not Mr. Carvalho’s first public flirtation with professional indecision. In 2008, he was offered two superintendent jobs nearly simultaneously, in Miami-Dade and Pinellas County. The Pinellas County school board offered him the job first, but the same day, the Miami-Dade board ousted its superintendent, Rudy Crew. They asked Mr. Carvalho if he would take the superintendent job on an interim basis, but, with an offer in hand, he said no. In a chaotic meeting, the board voted to offer him the job permanently. Mr. Carvalho then took two days to decide, saying that he was “soul-searching” and that he wanted to “honor the process” by speaking with the chairs of each board. In the end, he took the job in Miami-Dade, where he was offered a higher salary, though he said that was not a factor. New York City officials said they would match his $352,874 Miami salary, going much higher than the salary of the current New York City chancellor, who earns $234,569. A savvy operator with years of experience in the school district’s communications and governmental affairs office, Mr. Carvalho is known to speak in perfectly quotable sound bites. But he has also proven to be prickly when asked about personal shortcomings, including the possible affair with the former reporter. A media frenzy over his personal life would have been unavoidable as chancellor.
nyregion,Mr. Carvalho has long held higher aspirations, including becoming United States secretary of education, and being chancellor in New York might have gotten him closer to that dream. He said Thursday he knew staying in Miami-Dade was perhaps not his best career move. “I hope I don’t come to regret” the decision, he said. Remaining appears likely to give him more control over the nine-member school board, which had recently started to question him more than in years past. His local stature will only grow if he is perceived as having sacrificed personal gain to remain superintendent. Mr. Carvalho acknowledged telling Mr. de Blasio that he had accepted the job. His close friends had advised him to leave “on top, when things are good,” in Miami-Dade. “When I walked into the room today, I was going to New York City,” Mr. Carvalho said. He changed his mind in a “real-time decision,” he said. “I understand how unorthodox this is.” When he finally reached Mr. de Blasio by phone, Mr. Carvalho said the mayor told him he’d been watching the Miami-Dade meeting, which was streaming online. Mr. Carvalho called the conversation “difficult and a little sad,” but also professional. Asked about the tweet by Mr. de Blasio’s press secretary questioning who would want to hire — or vote — for him after reneging on his word to New York, Mr. Carvalho said, “I accept that.”
business/dealbook,Credit Suisse’s Painful Turnaround Is Falling Short - The New York Times Credit Suisse’s turnaround is proving more painful than it could have been. The Swiss bank’s fourth-quarter results were riddled with the kind of exceptional items and restructuring costs that were par for the course for a European investment bank rethinking its strategy. But even after stripping these out, and ignoring the bits that Credit Suisse is winding down, the bank would have failed to turn a profit. Asia-Pacific was the only one of Credit Suisse’s newly created divisions that increased its fourth-quarter revenue. Pretax profit would have risen by more than a quarter from last year if adjusted for good-will write-downs. Tidjane Thiam, the bank’s chief executive, looks on track to hit his target for the segment to deliver 2.1 billion Swiss francs of pretax profit by 2018. But that depends partly on China, and Mr. Thiam is wary over that market’s near-term prospects. If that’s the good, then double-digit declines in fourth-quarter revenue in private banking in Switzerland and regions other than Asia look downright bad. Net asset declines in these regions will not help Mr. Thiam hit targets that are frankly ambitious. The ugliest aspects of the results concerned Credit Suisse’s capital position and markets trading performance, however. In trading, fourth-quarter fixed-income revenue fell a staggering 61 percent year-on-year – far worse than for peers.
business/dealbook,The balance sheet looks parlous, too. Despite a hefty cash call as part of the October strategic overhaul, Credit Suisse’s common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.4 percent at the end of December was well below the 12 percent-plus average for Europe’s banks. Listing Credit Suisse’s Swiss unit is part of the plan, and it will raise capital. But proposing no dividend might have been smart. That’s what Deutsche Bank did. The parallels with Deutsche do not end there. Shares in both Credit Suisse and its rival now trade close to record lows. Mr. Thiam wants to continue cost-cutting and is slashing bonuses, as well as reducing the deferred portion of these to bring down fixed costs. That will help to some extent, and these are early days. But so far, Credit Suisse is not making much out of its overhaul.
world/europe,As France and Belgium Strengthen Security, a Classic Debate Arises - The New York Times PARIS —  Shocked by the carnage of the Paris attacks, France and Belgium moved aggressively on Thursday to strengthen the hand of their security forces, pushing Europe more deeply into a debate that has raged in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001: how to balance counterterrorism efforts and civil liberties. With their populations stunned and nervous and political pressure growing on the right, the French and Belgian governments made it clear that, for now, they would put protecting their citizens ahead of other considerations. With time, the United States has moved to ease some elements of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. It has also strengthened oversight of intelligence agencies and of mass domestic surveillance in the wake of the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency who leaked documents about surveillance. But European nations battered by terrorism are moving in the other direction. Those nations include France, which has suffered multiple attacks this year; Belgium, where many of the Paris attackers lived or grew up; and Britain, which has thwarted a number of plots in recent years. Each is updating and strengthening government power while debating further controls over passport-free travel within continental Europe. Since Friday’s attacks on Paris, France has aggressively used emergency powers, for example, to round up potential terrorism suspects across the country in an effort to disrupt any further plots.
world/europe,Finding the right balance between individual rights and antiterrorism measures has grown more complex in the 14 years since the United States was struck by Al Qaeda, in part because of the pervasiveness of digital technology and the ensuing questions about personal privacy. But in the days after the Paris attacks, there has been relatively little reflection about the trade-offs as the nations most affected, France and Belgium, rushed to put new security measures in place and alter their legal and constitutional structures to give government more flexibility in dealing with threats. As Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France warned darkly on Thursday of the possibility of chemical and biological attacks, France’s National Assembly voted, 551 to 6 with one abstention, to extend for three months a national state of emergency imposed after the attacks in Paris by the Islamic State, which killed 129 people and wounded 352. “The state of emergency, it’s true, justifies certain temporary restrictions on liberties,” Mr. Valls said. “But resorting to this, it’s to give us every chance to fully restore these liberties.” In Belgium, Prime Minister Charles Michel said he would rush through legal changes to make it easier to capture, try and punish suspected terrorists operating there. He also said he would seek constitutional changes to extend the length of time suspects can be held by the police without the filing of charges to 72 hours, from 24.
world/europe,His plan calls for the imprisonment of jihadists returning to Belgium from overseas, and would require anyone deemed a threat to wear an ankle bracelet. The plan would also ban the anonymous sale of telephone SIM cards that allow terrorists to hide their identities; would remove restrictions on what times of day the police are permitted to conduct raids on terrorism suspects; and would allow the authorities to arrest or expel religious figures “who preach hatred.” Mr. Michel also wants to require all passengers traveling on high-speed trains as well as airplanes to register their identities before departure. Jan Techau, the director of Carnegie Europe, a research organization based in Brussels, said he saw the reactions as perfectly natural. “The home front is the field of political activity now — it will all be about homeland security,” he said. “There is a sense that the authorities are no longer in control, and it’s a clear attempt by authorities to regain some trust.” But advocates for civil liberties warned against governments going too far, and suggested that European nations had to be particularly careful that the measures they were taking were not aimed at one class of citizens: Muslims. Officials at Human Rights Watch in Belgium cautioned on Thursday that the authorities should ensure such measures did not lead to indiscriminate roundups or unnecessary restrictions on freedom of speech, movement and religion.
world/europe,“Like every nation, Belgium has a responsibility to protect its people from attacks, but it should not trample basic rights in the process,” said Letta Tayler, a senior terrorism and counterterrorism researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Whenever a country is attacked or threatened, there is a danger that governments will overreact in an effort to make people secure.” The French emergency bill, which the French Senate is expected to approve on Friday, extends the powers of a 1955 emergency law to allow the dissolution of radical groups running mosques and other places of prayer; the blocking of websites and social media that glorify or incite terrorism; and the use, in certain cases, of electronic tagging for those placed under house arrest. It is the first time since the 1955 law was passed that a national state of emergency has been declared. France is already being patrolled by heavily armed soldiers, and now police officers who are off duty will be allowed to carry firearms and use them if they wear an armband identifying themselves as police. On Wednesday, the French authorities said they had carried out more than 414 raids across the country, arrested 64 people and placed another 118 under house arrest. Under the emergency, the authorities are permitted to conduct raids and make arrests without first obtaining a warrant. But as soon as someone is arrested or property is seized, the regular legal system kicks in. Suspects in terrorism cases are already allowed to be held without charge for up to six days.
world/europe,In the United States, even in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, raids on that scale would have created a storm of criticism, but the French, only 10 months after Islamist radicals attacked the newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, have generally accepted the crackdown as necessary. Mr. Hollande has also called for enshrining the state of emergency law in France’s Constitution, making it easier to declare such a state for longer periods of time without resorting to the more drastic options currently available in the Constitution. Mr. Hollande also wants to make it easier to expel foreigners deemed to be a security threat; to revoke the French nationality of dual citizens, even those born in France, if they are convicted of terrorism-related offenses; and to close radical mosques. France had already moved last summer to strengthen and modernize laws governing electronic surveillance after the attacks in January. Laws passed by large majorities gave broad legal authority for the state to snoop on citizens. Some civil liberties groups were vocally opposed, with Amnesty International saying June’s law took France “a step closer to a surveillance state,” while some called it a “Patriot Act à la Française.” In Belgium, the call for broad new powers came after the government was stung by criticism that it had failed to act aggressively enough to identify and stop plots being planned on its soil. Mr. Michel also vowed a crackdown on Molenbeek, the Brussels district that has bred so many jihadists and harbored others.
world/europe,As in France, many Belgians said that while the measures were drastic, they were prepared to give up some of their personal freedoms in return for security. Belgium has been so shaken by the Paris attacks that there is a broad agreement that something needs to be done, said Steven Blockmans, an analyst at the Center for European Policy Studies based in Brussels. There is a consensus about the need to strengthen law enforcement, intelligence agencies and local governments, he said. Mr. Michel’s moves are a partial vindication for the right-wing New Flemish Alliance, which has been calling for these measures for years, Mr. Blockmans said. The interior minister, Jan Jambon, who is a member of the party, recently said that Molenbeek needed to be “flushed out.” Belgium has looser gun control laws than France but stricter controls on surveillance, which the new measures would loosen. For example, the authorities can intercept telephone conversations only if there is a strong suspicion that the targets are terrorists, said Jelle Van Buuren, a lecturer in counterterrorism at Leiden University. The surveillance cannot be extended to people who may be accomplices or have minor roles, he said. Bart Tommelein, Belgium’s federal secretary in charge of privacy, said that the restrictions on privacy would only apply to terrorism suspects. “If we are talking about suspected terrorists and people who have committed such crimes, then privacy doesn’t exist,” he said. “So for people who go to Syria, or return from Syria, that border can be crossed, they lose that right,” but others will not.
world/europe,It was not the government’s intention to “put everyone in a database, but to target and put people suspected of engaging in terrorist activity in a database,” he said, and he insisted, “We won’t place security above freedom.”
sports/baseball,Astros and Yankees Take Some Shaky Memories Into Game 7 - The New York Times HOUSTON — The Houston Astros hang their championship flags in two vertical columns on the light poles above left field at Minute Maid Park. All of them are blue except for an orange one, from 2005, that signifies their only trip to the World Series. There is no color for a championship, because the Astros don’t have one. This might be their best chance. The Astros will host the Yankees in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series on Saturday night, earning the date with seven overpowering innings from Justin Verlander in a 7-1 victory on Friday. Houston had lost the last three games in the Bronx. “This is a difficult team across the way,” Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said. “We’re also a difficult team to close out.” True enough, especially if the Astros’ late flurry in Game 6 — a four-run eighth — has truly sparked the majors’ best offense, which had hit just .147 through Game 5. Historically, though, the Astros are a team that struggles to close playoff series, and Friday nearly followed the same script. The Astros started as a National League expansion team called the Colt .45s in 1962, and finally reached the postseason in 1980, when they met the Philadelphia Phillies. The teams staged the most scintillating best-of-five league championship series ever, with four games stretching to extra innings.
sports/baseball,In Game 5, at the Astrodome, the Astros led by three runs in the eighth inning with Nolan Ryan on the mound. Yet the Phillies came back and went on to win the World Series. In 1986, also at the Astrodome, the Astros held another three-run lead, this time over the Mets in the ninth inning. A victory would have set up Game 7 and shifted the edge to the Astros, who could use their ace, Mike Scott, whose suspiciously moving splitters had burrowed into the Mets’ psyche. Yet the Mets, like the Phillies before them, stormed back to win the game and, eventually, the World Series. Fast forward past a few swift exits in the division series, a seven-game loss to St. Louis in the 2004 N.L.C.S. and a sweep by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 World Series. After beating the Yankees in the 2015 A.L. wild-card game, the Astros took a 6-2 lead into the eighth inning of Game 4 of their division series with the Kansas City Royals. By now, you know the pattern. The Royals, who were facing elimination, came back to win the game. They, too, were soon World Series champions. Which brings us to Friday, when the Astros again found themselves with a three-run lead in the eighth inning, trying to extend the series. Verlander had avoided a jam in the seventh, surviving a walk, a hit batter, a 10-pitch at-bat by Aaron Hicks and Todd Frazier’s dangerous drive to center, which George Springer snared with a leap. A groundout ended the inning on Verlander’s 99th pitch.
sports/baseball,Not all pitches take the same kind of toll on a pitcher. Ninety-nine pitches in the caldron of October can feel different from the same amount in a blowout in June. Such was the case for Verlander, who had worked all nine innings of Game 2. His 99 on Friday were all he could give. “There’s no point in saving anything,” Verlander said, explaining that he tries to forget the inning in postseason games so he can concentrate solely on the next pitch. “It’s just kind of: I’m out there until I’m not out there any longer.” For Hinch, the point came after seven innings. Verlander would not have lasted much longer anyway, he said, so it was better to pull him between innings. He would not send a tiring stalwart back to the mound to face the Yankees with the season on the line, as a doomed Grady Little did with Boston’s Pedro Martinez in Game 7 of the 2003 A.L.C.S. Brad Peacock came in, Hinch said, because he liked the way his slider and riding fastball would play against the top of the Yankees’ order. But after Brett Gardner flied out, Aaron Judge clobbered a fastball to the train tracks high above deep left-center. “I tried to challenge Judge and just lost — he put a pretty good swing on it,” Peacock said, laughing. “A solo’s not gonna kill us there. Just kept my confidence and made some pitches.”
sports/baseball,With the lead cut to 3-1 and Didi Gregorius and Gary Sanchez coming up, the Yankees had a chance to follow the example of the Phillies, the Mets and the Royals. But Peacock fought back after three balls to Gregorius, inducing a flyout, and he froze Sanchez with a full-count, two-seam fastball that ran back over the plate for strike three. Hinch said he had decided to use closer Ken Giles for only one inning, after the Yankees bruised Giles in the eighth for a comeback win in Game 4. Even after the Astros extended their lead off David Robertson, Hinch stayed with Giles, turning to his best option to get the series to Game 7. Now it is here, with perhaps a full staff of Astros pitchers ready to follow starter Charlie Morton. Expect bullpen seating to be at a premium, with Dallas Keuchel, Lance McCullers Jr. and perhaps even Verlander — “he’s superhuman,” Hinch said — available on short rest. “If things get crazy, I’m your man,” Keuchel said, smiling. “I’ll be good; it’s just my arm.” Verlander said he would talk with Hinch on Saturday and be honest about what he could offer. The fact that he will even be considered, of course, underscores how erratic the Astros’ relievers can be. Friday’s example aside, history offers a grim forecast for Houston. Then again, Game 7 is not always kind to the Yankees, either. The last time they played one, in 2004, they let a pennant — and a once-insurmountable three-games-to-none lead — slip away to the rival Red Sox. Nothing on Saturday could be as crushing as that.
arts/music,Ed Sheeran, Lighter and Wiser, Releases ‘x’ - The New York Times AUSTIN, Tex. — Seven hours before Ed Sheeran was scheduled to perform at a taping of the show “Austin City Limits” here this month, three young women were sitting on a red blanket on the sidewalk outside the studio, braving 97-degree heat in hope of getting a ticket. Usual pop idol stuff. Inside the studio a few hours later, the unusual pop idol — a pint-size 23-year-old British folk singer with a mop of red hair and an unassuming mien — was exultant. “I’m a small again!” he piped up excitedly, slipping on one of the show’s T-shirts to wear during his performance. The last year or so had been rough — on his waistline, his romantic life, his state of mind and more — and finally, a couple of weeks before the release of his second album, “x” (Atlantic), he’d recalibrated: “I went from an S to an M to an L, back to M, back to S.” On “x” (pronounced “multiply”), which comes out Monday, Mr. Sheeran more or less tells the story of the accompanying emotional path, taking in the almost three years since the release of his debut album, “+,” which very, very slowly made him a star, which in turn very, very slowly started to remake him from the inside out, until he reversed the tide.
arts/music,Until now, Mr. Sheeran has been best known for “The A Team,” a melancholy dirge of a ballad that tells the story of a drug-addicted prostitute, sweetened mightily by Mr. Sheeran’s plaintive voice and his gift for effortless melody. The song was a slow burner, eventually reaching No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also helped land him a slot opening for Taylor Swift on her “Red” tour last year. That put him squarely in the cross hairs of thousands of teenage girls, and helped make his skeletal modern folk an unlikely pop phenomenon; last year, he sold out three nights at Madison Square Garden. “I don’t look like your typical pop star,” he said during an afternoon break at his hotel. “I don’t sing songs like your typical pop star.” Mr. Sheeran’s impressive new album deliberately builds on that success in only incremental aesthetic ways. The opening single is “Sing,” an up-tempo blue-eyed soul dance track produced by Pharrell Williams, a clean fit in the Timberlake-Thicke white-soul succession plan, without the burden of having to innovate the style. It gives Mr. Sheeran something he lacked last time around, and wasn’t shy about wanting this time — an obvious radio hit. “I wanted to make something Justin Timberlake-y,” he said, adding that the song wasn’t originally intended for this album, added only at the urging of one of his mentors, Elton John.
arts/music,Even in relating this point, Mr. Sheeran is nothing but unassuming, and singer-songwriter folk is almost definitionally modest: lone performer onstage, often with just a guitar. (He augments the setup with a loop station that he manipulates with his feet.) But even though he may well be the most prominent folk-minded singer in contemporary pop, he’s an open-eared experimenter at core, and saddled with none of the modesty, false or otherwise, that typically go with the folkie role. He began busking and playing small gigs as a teenager, encouraged by his father, who told him he could leave school behind as long as he was working hard toward something. “The thing I was running from was having a mapped-out life,” he said. “The competitive thing came early on,” he recalled. “Being on a lineup of five singer-songwriters and being, like, ‘I want to kill all of you.’ ” He likened it to Kendrick Lamar’s fiery taking of names on “Control”: “Love for all of you, but I’m here to blow you away.” He self-released a string of EPs, but his most significant early notice wasn’t for his straight-ahead folk but for a collaboration album with some of the leading lights in grime music, at the time the dominant sound of black Britain, a project that immediately set Mr. Sheeran apart. Collaborating widely has since been part of his career, writing songs for One Direction among others, but he insists that his most edgeless side — the pure singer-songwriter side — is his most natural: “I’d say that’s where I’m most comfortable.”
arts/music,That’s the case on “x,” which has other up-tempo songs in addition to “Sing” (already Mr. Sheeran’s biggest American hit), but it shines most brightly on Mr. Sheeran’s gentler numbers. “Tenerife Sea” is an unreserved love song, with Mr. Sheeran multitracking his vocals for a chilling, twee effect. On “Thinking Out Loud,” he draws a lovely picture of a love that doesn’t age. (“When my hands don’t play the strings the same way/I know you will still love me the same.”) Mr. Sheeran is a gifted singer with a tender tone and a naturalistic way with storytelling, which made him an apt choice to tour with Ms. Swift. (The two also shared a bracing duet, “Everything Has Changed,” on her last album.) But also like Ms. Swift, he prefers in conversation not to color inside the lines he draws in his music. On teenage brushes with the law: “Both times I didn’t do anything, I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.” On drugs: “Experimentation has been a part of my life ever since I was quite young, but it wouldn’t be something that I’d want to promote.” And he’d rather not attach names to the subjects of his songs. “The worst thing that could have happened out of this album has already happened — people assuming ‘Don’t’ is about someone.” That someone is the British singer Ellie Goulding, with whom he was spotted holding hands at last year’s MTV Video Music Awards.
arts/music,Perhaps the most folk thing about Mr. Sheeran is his stubborn wish that people focus on the content of his music, not its context, something that’s worried him more as he has become a minor tabloid figure. “Here’s a fact that’s interesting,” he said. “ ‘Sing’ is about a very, very well-known person. No one knows that, so no one’s being like, ‘Who’s it about?’ ” “Take It Back,” one of a handful of new songs (it’s on the album’s deluxe edition) on which he raps — Mr. Sheeran’s most angsty songs tend to be the ones he raps on — is also likely to raise plenty of questions: “Went from sleeping at a subway station/To sleeping with a movie star/And adding to the population.” (Mr. Sheeran said he does not have a child.) “I did everything last year,” he said exhaustedly. “Everything. Everything wrong and everything right. It was a very important year.” At one point, he moved to Los Angeles for a relationship, only to be dumped the day he arrived: “I literally landed from Canada, it ended, then I went to the house and unpacked my stuff.” He continued: “I was in a situation where something was presented to me that I never thought would ever be possible. I felt like I had to do it, I should not let this go, and I know now that things on the surface aren’t always what they are.”
arts/music,The accumulated intensity of his experiences — touring with Ms. Swift, living out of a suitcase and writing songs between shows — came at a price: “I didn’t really like myself last year, the whole package, I wasn’t happy.” But this year has been a time for restorative behavior. He’s been in a stable relationship, with a person out of the public eye. And after a seeing a photo shoot of himself this year in which he felt he looked too puffy, he gave up bread and beer, taking him back down to an S. His self-assurance is kicking back in, too: “I’d like to get to a point where you just reach a level and stay there — you know, how Springsteen never dropped from being Springsteen.” To that end, he spends a not insignificant amount of energy on the less glamorous side of the business. “I’m very excited about stats and figures,” he said. He is emailed chart and sales information every day. He knows how many people he played to on the Taylor Swift tour (1.6 million) and how many albums he sold as a result (20,000). When “Sing” was taking off in the United States, but not as quickly in Britain, he fretted. Part of Mr. Sheeran’s long-term success plan is to spread himself around. He’s recently written music for the pop group Rixton, the moody soul singer Jessie Ware, the teen dance music star Martin Garrix and for a collaboration between the R&B star Usher and the D.J.-producer Skrillex. “I watch the charts every single day,” he said, “and it would be a lot more interesting if I have more of my own” songs on them.
arts/music,In the van heading back to his hotel, he gleefully pulled out his phone and played a bit of a “Sing” remix done by Psy, the K-pop crossover star. In his room, he played several tracks he recorded with the rapper the Game, including one in which he coos, “She’s a freak show/Don’t you think she knows” over one of DJ Mustard’s signature minimalist beats. At the “Austin City Limits” taping, he performs intensely for the crowd, which is far younger than the ones typical for the show, which tends toward genteel singer-songwriters and austere Americana acts of an older generation. On “Give Me Love,” from his first album, he vibrates through the song, abusing his loop station and pushing his voice past its comfort zone. Near the end of “Don’t,” he throws in the chorus of Chris Brown’s “Loyal,” another caustic song about romantic disappointment. He sang “All of the Stars,” a song from the soundtrack to the recent weeper “The Fault in Our Stars,” taming the eager crowd into a rapt silence. Up in the control room, a director was orchestrating the cameras as they swept over the underlit faces of the teenage faithful. “She’s crying,” he said, as the camera lingered on one sobbing dark-haired girl. “Beautiful.”

world/asia,North Korea Aside, Guam Faces Another Threat: Climate Change - The New York Times HONG KONG — The island of Guam made rare headlines this week when North Korea, responding to blustery language from President Trump, threatened to fire four ballistic missiles into waters near the American territory’s shores. Some Guam residents told reporters that they worried what might happen if North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, were actually to follow through. Scientists in Guam, however, say they have at least one other major threat in mind: climate change. “We know that it’s serious,” said Austin J. Shelton III, a marine biologist and the executive director of the Center for Island Sustainability at the University of Guam. “Some of the impacts are here, and a lot more are coming.” Like other Pacific islands, Guam may be affected in the coming decades as climate change prompts shifts in weather, temperature and oceanic acidity, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Experts said in interviews that the primary consequences may include people suffering heat stress because of an increase in heat waves, a rise in the intensity of tropical storms, and the damage or destruction of Guam’s exceptionally biodiverse coral reefs. A key concern is how reef damage could affect a $1.4 billion tourism sector that, according to the Guam Visitors Bureau, accounts for 60 percent of Guam’s annual business revenue and nearly a third of its nonfederal employment.
world/asia,A 2007 study by the University of Guam Marine Laboratory estimated the economic value of Guam’s coral reefs to be $2 million per square kilometer, or 0.4 square mile, and nearly $15 million per square kilometer at a 2,153-foot area known for its diving and snorkeling sites. It said that reefs were valuable not only as tourist attractions, but also because they functioned as natural breakwaters that absorbed wave energy and protected against beach loss and coastal erosion. The reefs already experience periodic bleaching, and they could become more vulnerable because many have been overfished and can no longer support enough of the algae that helps reef ecosystems recover from bleaching, said Peter Houk, a coral reef specialist at the marine laboratory. “Do these tourists want to return if they don’t see a live reef?” he said. “I don’t know the answer to that.” Another concern is how climate change could affect operations at Guam’s military installations, including Andersen Air Force Base, a crucial staging ground for United States Air Force bombers that operate in East Asia. Analysts say that concern could grow if the Pentagon follows through with plans to move thousands of Marines to Guam from Okinawa, Japan, turning the island into even more of a strategic military hub. A 2012 study by the American Security Project, a research group in Washington, said that Guam’s military installations were among the five most vulnerable American ones worldwide to coastal erosion, extreme weather, rising sea levels and other projected climate change impacts.
world/asia,“Obviously you can’t run a war from a base that’s without power and water” after a major storm, said Andrew Holland, the group’s director of studies. He noted that when the last super typhoon hit Guam, in 2002, gasoline tanks exploded and much of the island was without electricity for weeks. The Pentagon said in a 2014 report that climate change posed an immediate threat to national security. And in June, the House Armed Services Committee passed an amendment to the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act that would require the secretary of defense to submit a report on how climate change could affect American military installations and combat requirements over the next 20 years. There are a number of climate adaptation studies underway in Guam, both civilian and military, said Victoria Keener, a research fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu who works on applied hydrology and climatology projects in the Pacific islands. The adaptation work includes research, overseen by a local climate change task force, on coastal infrastructure in tourist areas, Dr. Keener said, as well as a Pentagon-financed study to explore how climate change may affect the island’s freshwater resources. Dr. Keener said that, because Guam is not particularly low-lying, it probably would be less vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels than an island such as Kwajalein Atoll, in the Marshall Islands, where the defense contractor Lockheed Martin is building a $915 million radar system for the United States Air Force.
world/asia,But Guam’s topography is no guarantee that its climate adaptation projects would be effective over the long term, she added. “Climate change adaptation: It’s a new field,” she said, “and you really don’t know how well you’re preparing for things until 20 years, 30 years down the road.”
business/dealbook,One Unspoken Reason Behind the Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal - The New York Times “Let me explain why.” Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn’s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn “to control our own destiny.” But there may have been another reason that he left unspoken. That would be the company’s struggling stock price and its reliance — some might say overreliance — on stock-based compensation. On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn’s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100. The rapid devaluation has posed more than just a problem for investors. LinkedIn’s employees are paid largely in stock, and therein lies the rub: Around the company’s new 26-story skyscraper that opened in downtown San Francisco in March, as well as the corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., there have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes. Among Silicon Valley companies, “LinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation — there is no question about that,” Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. “If the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.”
business/dealbook,Mr. Weiner — who took over as LinkedIn’s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder — has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company’s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years. You wouldn’t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn’s news releases. That’s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what’s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue. LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation “is noncash in nature” and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides “meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.” But investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. “It has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,” Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, “is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: ‘compensation.’ If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?”
business/dealbook,Mr. Buffett also criticized analysts who “play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring ‘earnings’ figures fed them by managements.” In April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. “Stock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,” David Wehner, Facebook’s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call. Facebook’s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense. It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings — and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it. Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. “There are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,” he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.
business/dealbook,LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which “have the most dependence on stock-based compensation,” also have results “of relatively lower quality,” Mr. Mahaney said. Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft’s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see). A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees. In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn’s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley — Facebook, Google and a few others — had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.

style,Many Unhappy Returns? Online Holiday Shopping’s Big Hangover - The New York Times Kristina Nicolas will proudly tell you that she’s been doing practically all her shopping online for years now. She will also tell you, in a more exasperated voice, that this has not remotely abbreviated the amount of time she spends going to stores. “It has become a huge errand and a huge part of my life having to get all this stuff back to where it came from,” said Ms. Nicolas, a stay-at-home mother and former fashion buyer. She receives about 10 to 15 boxes per week of merchandise at her home in Chicago, and returns (or tries to return) about 30 percent. The ease of the task varies. “Sometimes it can be returned to the store, but sometimes it cannot,” said Ms. Nicolas, growing louder. “Sometimes it’s UPS, or DHL, or FedEx, or however they shipped it, then you have to print up a label, and I never seem to have the right tape.” And who has a working printer at home anyway? “I don’t really need one except for this,” said Beth Paholak, a TV producer who has sacrificed a corner of her small apartment in Manhattan to boxes awaiting return. “And I’m not buying a printer just for returns.” The paradox of e-commerce now is that while acquiring items has gotten easier than ever before, exchanging or returning the unwanted ones remains an epic, tyrannical time suck.
style,It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Online shopping would save us time, we were told. It would free us from the torment of malls, angry clerks and wasted Saturdays. But as the fantasy becomes real — e-commerce will account for $2.3 trillion, or one-tenth of all retail sales, in 2017, according to eMarketer — some shoppers are surprised to discover they are devoting as much time to returns as they once did to in-person shopping, with less fun. “I’ve ended up keeping stuff because the return process was such a pain,” said Rob Cromer, an entrepreneur in New York City, using profanity. Likewise, Ms. Nicolas is currently making peace with the fact that the three wooden cutting boards she bought for Thanksgiving, total cost $100, are hers to keep at this point. Between Dec. 26 and Jan. 31, 45 percent of Americans will try to return at least one gift, according to Optoro, an e-commerce software company. Today, that gift is more likely than ever to have been purchased online: 2017 is the first year that a majority of Americans planned to do their holiday shopping on the web, according to Deloitte. But while a handful of retailers receive nearly unanimous praise from shoppers for open-ended, friction-free returns of purchases made online (Amazon, Nordstrom, L.L. Bean, Madewell, among others), and many offer more generous policies during the holiday season, plenty still impose tight limitations and draconian requirements that seem designed to either discourage returns or drive traffic into their physical locations.
style,Forever 21 and Shopbop require customers to return items bought online within 30 days, and like Victoria’s Secret, Kohl’s and Rue La La, don’t always pay for shipping (Shopbop offers refunds for items returned within 15 days). Returns to Net-a-Porter must be made within 28 days, and within 14 days for Apple and Barnes & Noble — a narrow window if you factor in packing and shipping. Many retailers will send multiple items from a single order in separate boxes, each of which could require its own label (and box) in case of return. And while Amazon refunds your money the moment UPS scans your box for return, others make customers wait weeks to see the refund on their credit card — a period of uncertainty too agonizing for some. “If I can’t go the store to return something, I won’t make the purchase,” said Lauren Nolte, a marketing executive in Los Angeles. “It’s like you have to make up your mind the second you get the item, then run to the post office or you’re out of luck.” And good luck finding a post office open before or after work. One can also feel sorry for the stores. Returns cost retailers $260 billion in 2015, according to the National Retail Federation. And about 30 percent of items bought online end up being returned, versus 9 percent of items bought in stores.
style,Retailers can ease the expense if they can convince customers to return Web-purchased items to stores in person. On average, returns to stores cost companies half as much as returns to distribution centers, and allow retailers to get the items back on shelves faster, according to new research from AlixPartners, a consulting firm. And driving shoppers into stores has the added benefit of possibly resulting in more purchases. (The good news for retailers: 62 percent of consumers prefer in-store returns.) In November, Walmart raised some of its prices online to encourage in-store foot traffic and cut down on shipping costs. Whether its attempts to discourage online returns will save money or simply drive away customers remains to be seen. “This is principally a reason why many retailers aren’t making any money,” said Mark A. Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School and a former chief executive of Sears Canada. E-commerce start-ups have the extra challenge of needing to build loyalty. “These are new businesses that are just learning what they’re in for,” Mr. Cohen said. The unavoidable shortcomings of online shopping may make a high return rate a necessary part of the process. Trying on clothes isn’t an option, and colors often appear different in person, leading many shoppers to buy an item in multiple sizes or colors with the intention of sending back the misfits.
style,But there is also the growing problem of so-called wardrobing: buying an item to use once knowing it can be returned afterward. The classic example is a prom dress, but generous return policies are luring more people to try bringing back, say, the camcorder they bought to record the prom, too. Some third-party vendors are eager to cash in on the inconvenience of returns. In 2015, two former Nordstrom employees started Happy Returns, a company that operates physical “return bars” in malls where customers can give back items brought from e-commerce retailers including Everlane, Chubbies and Tradesy for immediate refunds. Happy Returns has 50 locations and expects to open 150 more by the end of 2018. And in October, Amazon paid a reported $50 to $70 million to acquire Body Labs, a start-up specializing in technology that allows shoppers to create 3-D avatars for trying on clothes online. While you wait for a better system to come along, there are steps you can take to cut down on online returns, said Eric Himel, a stylist whose clients include Giuliana Rancic and Kristin Cavallari. “Shopping is something you have to be in the right frame of mind for, and you have to dig in and do a little work,” he said. That means no more clicking and buying at midnight, or after a second cocktail, and always taking the time to read reviews, check the fabrication and make yourself aware of return policies.
style,Most important, Mr. Himel advised, remember that clothes modeled by professionals online may not look the same in your mirror. “It’s like I tell women, ‘Don’t go shopping with your girlfriend, because they’re always going to say something looks cute on you.’” If you miss the cut-off dates, you can sell mistakes through secondhand marketplaces like Letgo, Vestiaire Collective or the TheRealReal. You’re not likely to get full price, but getting anything can feel like a triumph (though of course, you still have to pack it up and ship it). “I’ll say to my husband, ‘See I made money!’” Ms. Nicolas said. “He says, ‘No you did not. You lost money today.’”
dining,The Chinese Club Is Reborn in Brooklyn - The New York Times The Chinese Club The family history that has inspired this Chinese-Indian restaurant goes back to the days of the Raj. Stacey Mehta Lo, who owns it with her husband, the chef Salil Mehta, was born in Darjeeling, India, where her great-grandfather ran the Chinese Club, a “refuge for Chinese expats,” as she put it. He served Chinese food, especially the cuisine of his Hakka heritage, a culture concentrated on the southern coast of China. Local Indians who came to the club to gamble also liked the food but wanted more Indian flavors, Ms. Mehta Lo said. Mr. Mehta’s menu is long, with dishes like Darjeeling Hakka lo mein, Chinese Club beef short rib with daikon, beer-battered General Tso’s chicken and Indian-Chinese vegetable fritters. The couple also owns the Malaysian restaurant Laut, near Union Square: 208 Grand Street (Driggs Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-487-4576, thechineseclubnyc.com. Between the Bread This cafe and caterer dating from 1979 is now being run by Jon Eisen, whose mother, Ricky Eisen, founded it. For decades, it consisted only of the original on East 56th Street and a spinoff on West 55th Street, which became the flagship once the East Side location closed. Now Mr. Eisen is going into expansionist overdrive. He opened a grab-and-go storefront at 20 East 40th Street near Fifth Avenue last fall and has just added this fast-casual, assembly-line branch in Chelsea. The chef is Brandon Byrd, who worked in the Momofuku Group, and his menu emphasizes vegetables prepared in-house. It’s in the Terminal Warehouse building, a vast brick structure with a central concourse used for events, and other party rooms. A wine shop and a branch of ‘Wichcraft have also opened in the building, and more retailers are coming: 609 West 27th Street (11th Avenue), 212-765-1687, betweenthebread.com.

sports/hockey,For the Defense-First St. Louis Blues, the Score Gets a Rewrite - The New York Times TORONTO —  The pulsating beat of dance music boomed across the visitors’ locker room at Air Canada Centre after a St. Louis Blues practice this month. Amused teammates and reporters turned their attention to a corner, where the source, a grinning Vladimir Tarasenko, quickly lowered the volume again. “I try to switch it sometimes,” said Tarasenko, who cannot abide the country music favored by some of his teammates. “This is Russian,” he said of his selection. A 23-year-old right wing from Novosibirsk on the Siberian plains, Tarasenko has emerged as a budding star for the Blues, who have the second best record in the Western Conference. Revamped with several off-season free-agent signings, St. Louis is the second-highest scoring team in the Western Conference, led by Tarasenko’s 35 goals and 35 assists. An All-Star this season, Tarasenko has embraced the exacting structure of Coach Ken Hitchcock’s defensive systems. Still, he owes much of his success to familiar sounds from home. Tarasenko consults regularly with his father, Andrei, who coached him with Sibir Novosibirsk, a professional team in the Kontinental Hockey League. After games, he phones his grandfather, who helped raise a young Vladimir while Andrei was playing professional hockey in the Russian Superleague, in which he was the 1997-98 scoring champion.
sports/hockey,“My grandpa and my father helped me a lot,” Vladimir Tarasenko said, adding that his sports pedigree came with increased pressure. “I think it’s more tough, mentally. When your father plays really good, he expects it from you, too. My father told me: ‘You’re going to be better than me. That’s going to be your goal.’ That’s what I try to do.” At 6 feet and 219 pounds, Tarasenko is built like a tank, and fans started calling him Tank after he was selected by the Blues with the 16th overall pick in the 2010 N.H.L. draft. But teammates refer to him as Vladdie, or Vova, Russian shorthand for Vladimir. In Russia, his father’s teams employed defensive and neutral-zone strategies similar to those favored by Hitchcock, and Tarasenko sought out Hitchcock’s former players for advice before arriving in St. Louis. Still, the transition to the smaller dimensions of N.H.L. rinks, and a schedule with 20 more games than are played in Europe has not been easy, he said. In his first season with the Blues, in 2012-13, Tarasenko scored eight goals in 38 games. Last season, he raised his total to 21 goals in 64 games. This season, he has thrived with center Jori Lehtera and left wing Jaden Schwartz on the Blues’ second line. Lehtera, a 27-year-old Finn who signed with the Blues in the off-season, played with a teenage Tarasenko for Sibir Novosibirsk, and he was eager to be reunited in St. Louis, where he occupies an adjacent locker.
sports/hockey,“When I signed, I was hoping to get to play with him because I’m kind of a passer and he’s a goal scorer,” Lehtera said. “I like to give pucks to him, and he has an unbelievable shot. He can score a lot of goals.” Lehtera has behaved like a big brother to Tarasenko, Hitchcock said. “Lehtera really took him under his wing,” he said. “They were linemates together, and Jori’s helping him along. He helps him in a good way by keeping him focused and calm, not allowing him to get too high or too low.” The Blues were a team of wild fluctuations during Tarasenko’s first two seasons, each time finishing in the top four in the Western Conference and seizing a 2-0 advantage in the opening round of the playoffs before ultimately collapsing. Those Blues teams tended to play a grinding defensive style, relying on offensive contributions from David Backes, their center and captain, and wings T. J. Oshie and Alex Steen. Those three again make up the Blues’ No. 1 line, drawing a checking role while trying to outscore the opposition’s top scorers with a simple strategy that sets the tone for the team. “They are just a blue-collar team, whether going to the net, skating hard, forechecking hard, shooting the puck,” Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Roman Polak said. Yet Hitchcock said new personnel permitted his perennially stingy team to attack more. In addition to Lehtera, the Blues added the free agent Paul Stastny, a leading two-way center who grew up in St. Louis, where his father, the Hall of Famer Peter Stastny, played and worked for the Blues.
sports/hockey,Paul Stastny, who has scored more than 20 goals six times in his career, plays on the third line, creating matchup headaches for opponents. “This is a different group,” Hitchcock said. “This isn’t the same team.” He added: “We do more off the rush than we’ve ever done. We have more ability to quick strike. We don’t play on the grind like we did before. This is a team that’s never out of a game.” Steen, too, has noticed a difference, with the top two lines complementing each other. With nine games remaining in the regular season, Steen is on pace for a career high in points, and so is Schwartz. “It’s a two-way street,” Steen said. “Their work has helped us, and I think our work has helped them.” Tarasenko turned philosophical when discussing this season’s results. “When you try for a long time to win something and it doesn’t work, you try something different,” he said. “Right now, we know we can’t win without unbelievable team spirit. A team that doesn’t have team spirit will never win. That’s why we try to keep it up in the locker room and try to be — not close friends — but try to be good to each other, nice to each other.” For a team with a blue note as its crest, that includes sometimes tolerating others’ taste in music.
fashion,Cast and Fans of ‘Will & Grace’ Toast the Show’s Return - The New York Times It’s been 11 years since we last saw them together, so when Will and Grace fell into a hug halfway through a party on Saturday night, you could practically hear the theme song’s rousing piano-pounded first chords. Flashbulbs exploded around them. Onlookers oohed and aahed. “This is my favorite show ever,” a young man said with a gasp. “I’m dying.” Death didn’t seem imminent, but much has come to pass since “Will & Grace” was last broadcast on NBC in 2006. So there was a fond sense of reunion when partygoers joined Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and other cast members at Mr. Purple lounge in Manhattan to celebrate the show’s Sept. 28 return. (Megan Mullally was ill.) The party, which was given by Vanity Fair and the Cinema Society, was happy, familiar and quite warm. Guests shimmered with sweat on the terraces, where Rihanna blasted from omnipresent speakers into the muggy September night. “It’s so hot, I’m sweating,” said Mariska Hargitay of “Law & Order: S.V.U.” Her husband, Peter Hermann, of the comedy series “Younger,” brought her a slider. “God, I love you,” she told him, biting into it. “I was so hungry.” Harry Connick Jr., a returning guest star on the series, and Keegan-Michael Key had a crossed-arms confab by the bar, while a baseball-capped David Schwimmer sneaked in and out. Tituss Burgess chatted up Scott Adsit, and Carol Kane was curled in a couch corner, a dog in her bag.
fashion,Mr. McCormack, who was congratulated at every step, took a break on a chaise longue to answer some questions. How does the reboot measure up? “It’s possible it’s better,” he said. “We’re older and wiser. If America embraces us again, I hope this can run for a while.” (NBC has already renewed the show for a 10th season.) Inside, guests downed martinis in nooks surrounded by assorted decorative nonsense including teapots and painter’s palettes. In the cast’s section, James Burrows, who directed the original series as well as the new season, hugged Diane Sawyer as she bobbed to remixed Amy Winehouse. Mr. Hayes sampled a margherita pizza while seated between his husband, Scott Icenogle, and Andy Cohen, who whispered excitedly in his ear. Ms. Messing, who wore a voluminous floral dress from Ingie Paris, stood shyly in a swarm of colleagues, handlers and well-wishers. Stealing an empty spot on the couch, Ms. Messing credited a get-out-the-vote video that the actors made last year for the show’s reprise. “I’m very critical of myself, and I’m really proud of this,” she said, pausing as the producer Nancy Jarecki leaned in with accolades. “I wanted to come back because I really felt the need to laugh again,” Ms. Messing said. “We’ve all been traumatized by the last year. We want people to have a respite for a half-hour, once a week. I’m excited for our fans to reunite with old friends. I hope it’s comforting.”
magazine,Has ‘Diversity’ Lost Its Meaning? - The New York Times How does a word become so muddled that it loses much of its meaning? How does it go from communicating something idealistic to something cynical and suspect? If that word is ‘‘diversity,’’ the answer is: through a combination of overuse, imprecision, inertia and self-serving intentions. Take the recent remarks by the venture capitalist John Doerr at this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September. Doerr, who with his firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has invested in Google, Facebook and Amazon, was on hand to discuss diversity in the overwhelmingly white and male Silicon Valley. After explaining that K.P.C.B. had begun putting its employees through training in unconscious bias — the company was the subject of a high-profile 2012 sex-discrimination lawsuit brought by a former executive, Ellen Pao, which Pao lost — the 64-year-old Harvard Business School graduate professed himself ‘‘deeply committed to diversity,’’ adding: ‘‘We have two new partners who are so diverse I have a challenge pronouncing their names.’’ Doerr was quick to issue an apology for what he called ‘‘an unfortunate joke,’’ but his conflation of a few additions with substantial changes in corporate hiring and recruitment practices inadvertently revealed what’s so irritating about the recent ubiquity of the word ‘‘diversity’’: It has become both euphemism and cliché, a convenient shorthand that gestures at inclusivity and representation without actually taking them seriously.
magazine,Many Silicon Valley firms are scrambling to hire executives to focus on diversity — there’s an opening at Airbnb right now for a ‘‘Head of Diversity and Belonging.’’ But at the biggest firms, women and minorities still make up an appallingly tiny percentage of the skilled work force. And the few exceptions to this rule are consistently held up as evidence of more widespread change — as if a few individuals could by themselves constitute diversity. When the word is proudly invoked in a corporate context, it acquires a certain sheen. It can give a person or institution moral credibility, a phenomenon that Nancy Leong, a University of Denver law professor, calls ‘‘racial capitalism’’ and defines as ‘‘an individual or group deriving value from the racial identity of another person.’’ It’s almost as if cheerfully and frequently uttering the word ‘‘diversity’’ is the equivalent of doing the work of actually making it a reality. This disconnect is not, of course, limited to tech. In this year's annual Pub­lishers Weekly survey of book-publishing employees, respondents — 89 percent of whom were white — found ‘‘no real change’’ in the racial composition of the work force since last year, despite ‘‘increased attention given to diversity.’’ The television and film industries are being investigated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over complaints of sex discrimination. And yet, as is the case in Silicon Valley, small victories are often overenthusiastically celebrated as evidence of larger change. In September, for example, when Viola Davis became the first African-American woman to win the Best Actress in a Drama Series Emmy, the moment was cheered in the press as a triumph of racial equity in Hollywood. But just a month before, Stacy L. Smith, a professor of communication at U.S.C. who, with other researchers, had just released a damning report that studied gender bias in 700 films made between 2007 and 2014, lamented ‘‘the dismal record of diversity, not just for one group, but for females, people of color and the L.G.B.T. community.’’
magazine,Why is there such a disparity between the progress that people in power claim they want to enact and what they actually end up doing about it? Part of the problem is that it doesn’t seem that anyone has settled on what diversity actually means. Is it a variety of types of people on the stages of awards shows and in the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies? Is it raw numbers? Is it who is in a position of power to hire and fire and shape external and internal cultures? Is it who isn’t in power, but might be someday? Adding to the ambiguity is the fact that the definition of ‘‘diversity’’ changes depending on who is doing the talking. The dictionary will tell you that it is ‘‘the quality or state of having many different forms, types, ideas,’’ and the word is often used, without controversy, to describe things like the environment and stock-market holdings. But in reality — which is to say, when applied to actual people, not flora, fauna or financial securities — the notion of diversity feels more fraught, positioning one group (white, male Americans) as the default, and everyone else as the Other. Multiple studies suggest that white Americans understand “diversity” much differently than black Americans. When Reynolds Farley, a demographer at the University of Michigan, researched the attitudes of people in Detroit about the racial composition of residential neighborhoods in 1976, 1992 and 2004, most African-Americans considered ‘‘integrated’’ to be a 50/50 mix of white and black, while a majority of whites considered such a ratio much too high for their comfort each time the study was conducted.
magazine,Bragging about hiring a few people of color, or women, seems to come from the same interpretive bias, where a small amount is enough. It also puts significant pressure on the few ‘‘diverse’’ folks who are allowed into any given club, where they are expected to be ambassadors of sorts, representing the minority identity while conforming to the majority one. All this can make a person doubt the sincerity of an institution or organization — and question their place within it. When I was starting out in magazines, I was told by a colleague that my hiring was part of the company’s diversity push, and that my boss had received a significant bonus as a result of recruiting me. Whether or not it was true, it colored the next few years I spent there, making me wonder whether I was simply some sort of symbol to make the higher-ups feel better about themselves. Diversity ‘‘is an empty signifier for me now,’’ says Jeff Chang, the author of 2014’s ‘‘Who We Be: The Colorization of America,’’ though ‘‘I still strongly believe in the possibility.’’ Chang prefers ‘‘equity’’ to ‘‘diversity,’’ saying that the latter has been ‘‘deradicalized’’ from its roots in the multicultural movements of decades past. He recalls an anecdote about a diversity week at a Texas university where few white students bothered to show up. ‘‘Diversity,’’ Chang says, ‘‘has become a code word for ‘all those other folks.’ ’’ The problem with code words is that they’re lazy: They’re broad rather than specific, and can provide cover for inaction — the ‘‘I don’t know how to do this or what it means, so can someone else please do the work for me?’’ maneuver.
magazine,Talk is cheap, of course, and sometimes you get the sense that the people talking the most about diversity are the people doing the least effective work on it. In the season premiere of his HBO reality series ‘‘Project Greenlight,’’ Matt Damon explained — to a veteran African-American producer, Effie Brown — that focusing on diversity in the casting of a film was more important than promoting diversity among those working behind the camera. It was a striking example not just of mansplaining but also of whitesplaining. His implication — roundly criticized on social media and in industry publications — is that on-screen visibility is everything, when what Hollywood needs just as much, if not more, are black studio executives, writers, directors and producers: the people who decide what stories are told in the first place. Maybe it’s not surprising that just a month later, the African-American director Ava DuVernay made the opposite argument of Damon’s at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards. DuVernay, who made ‘‘Selma,’’ pointed out that of the 100 top-grossing films last year, only two were directed by women. She urged constant vigilance and proactive searching within the industry: ‘‘We have to ask our agents about that script by the woman screenwriter. We have to ask, ‘Hey, are there any women agents here that I could talk to?’ We have to ask our lawyers about women in the office. We have to ask, when we’re thinking about directors or D.P.s, ‘Will women interview?’ ’’ Her words were powerful and refreshingly specific; they were also further evidence that the work of articulating and creating diversity often — usually! — falls to those who are themselves considered ‘‘diverse.’’
magazine,It’s something I have experienced myself. Over the past few years, numerous editors have reached out to me asking for help in finding writers and editors of color, as if I had special access to the hundreds of talented people writing and thinking on- and offline. I know they mean well, but I am often appalled by the ease with which they shunt the work of cultivating a bigger variety of voices onto others, and I get the sense that for them, diversity is an end — a box to check off — rather than a starting point from which a more inte­grated, textured world is brought into being. I’m not the only one to sense that there’s a feeling of obligation, rather than excitement, behind the idea. DuVernay herself hinted at this when she, too, admitted that she hates the word. ‘‘It feels like medicine,’’ she said in her speech. ‘‘ ‘Diversity’ is like, ‘Ugh, I have to do diversity.’ I recognize and celebrate what it is, but that word, to me, is a disconnect. There’s an emotional disconnect. ‘Inclusion’ feels closer; ‘belonging’ is even closer.’’
business/international,China’s Outflows of Money Slowed in February - The New York Times HONG KONG — Few economic statistics have gone as quickly from obscurity to the center of attention from international financial markets lately as China’s foreign currency reserves, widely seen as the best barometer of how long China can avoid a possible devaluation someday of its own currency. Monthly changes in the reserves these days mainly reflect how much money is being sent out of the country by Chinese companies and families nervous about the country’s economic slowdown and sweeping anticorruption investigations. Over the last five weeks, the Chinese government has waged an aggressive campaign to stem the outflow, through almost daily pledges by officials not to devalue and through much tighter enforcement of the rules on sending money overseas. Late Monday afternoon came word that the policies are starting to bear fruit: the erosion in China’s foreign exchange reserves slowed sharply last month from the pace of $100 billion a month that prevailed through the winter. Reserves fell by $28.6 billion last month, to $3.202 trillion. Most economists had anticipated a somewhat larger drop in reserves — Barclays had expected a fall of $70 billion, for example. The decline announced on Monday “is an encouraging sign because the concern amongst a lot of the bears was that the outflows would keep accelerating — the fact they’ve eased is reassuring,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, the China economist for Capital Economics, a research firm based in London.
business/international,Yi Gang, the senior deputy governor of the Chinese central bank, dismissed concerns about the nation’s currency during remarks earlier in the day outside the National People’s Congress session in Beijing. “The cross-border capital flows are in the normal range,” he said. At a time of turmoil in world financial markets, the renminbi is actually among the most stable currencies, Mr. Yi added. “Our volatility, the fluctuations of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and also the fluctuations against a basket of currencies, in reality and from a global perspective, are fundamentally the smallest.” China had caused alarm overseas and at home by devaluing its currency by 4 percent over three days in August, and by almost as much again over five weeks in late December and early January. The drop has prompted individuals and companies to move money overseas or make other moves. Many companies, for example, have repaid loans denominated in dollars before they become even more expensive in renminbi terms. But since January, the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has set the daily fixing of the renminbi against the dollar in Shanghai with no clear trend toward the strengthening or the weakening of the currency. And state-controlled Chinese banks have also intervened heavily in the less regulated Hong Kong market to protect the currency’s value here. Defending China’s currency, the renminbi, could nonetheless remain a challenge for Beijing. Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced on Saturday that his government would step up China’s already brisk expansion of its money supply, further flooding the economy with renminbi in an effort to make sure that banks can keep pumping out loans to companies.
business/international,Mr. Li included the money supply target in a broader panoply of measures aimed at maintaining economic growth at 6.5 percent or higher through 2020. Monetary stimulus helps economic growth by holding down interest rates. But lower interest rates also make it less attractive to invest in a currency, which could fuel further outflows of money from China. The reserves are a far from perfect measure of money leaving China. For starters, the change in the total value of the reserves is not influenced just by how much the central bank spends in currency markets to offset the outflow of money by Chinese companies and families. Changes in the value of China’s vast hoard of government securities and some equities denominated in euros, yen, pounds and other currencies also affect the overall level of the reserves, which is quoted in dollars. Economists estimate that about two-fifths of the reserves are held in currencies other than the dollar, and the dollar weakened slightly against most currencies during February. That suggests that the overall value of the reserves increased by about $13 billion last month because of currency moves — and indicates that the outflow of money in the last month may have been $13 billion greater than the figure of $28.6 billion that was announced on Monday morning.
business/international,Another consideration is China’s huge trade surplus, which brings another $50 billion or so into the country each month, although the surplus narrowed to $32.6 billion last month, partly because of the Chinese New Year. The decline in reserves last month suggests that capital outflows may have totaled about $75 billion, using all of the nearly $33 billion from the trade surplus and the $13 billion or so from valuation changes, in addition to nearly $30 billion from the reserves. The change in central bank reserves does not include one other variable that will not be released until later this month and will provide a further clue on outflows: how much state-controlled banks spent on intervention last month. In the last two weeks, Chinese officials have said repeatedly that they do not see a need to devalue the country’s currency against the three baskets, or weighted averages, of various foreign currencies against which the central bank measures it. The Chinese central bank strengthened the renminbi against the dollar by nearly 0.3 percent on Monday morning in fixing the daily band of values within which the renminbi is allowed to trade in Shanghai. Based on one model of reserves adequacy proposed by the International Monetary Fund, China needs a minimum of $1.5 trillion if it bars practically all investment flows in and out of the country. A minimum of $2.7 trillion is needed if China allows money to move in and out of the country freely. The central bank has been gradually tightening the enforcement of its regulations on capital flows.
business/international,The level of China’s reserves has become a subject of intense international interest as some large American hedge funds, like Hayman Capital Management in Dallas, have placed big bets in financial markets on a Chinese devaluation in the coming 12 to 18 months. “I’m not someone who hates China,” said J. Kyle Bass, the founder and principal of Hayman Capital, in a telephone interview last week. “What I’m good at is spotting credit bubbles.” But Chinese officials and many Chinese economists disagree with that gloomy prediction. They contend that official statistics showing limited bank exposure to nonperforming loans are credible, and that bank reserves to handle these loans are ample.
sports/soccer,Opponent in Finals Requests Chapecoense Be Awarded the Title - The New York Times Atlético Nacional, the Colombian team that was to play Chapecoense of Brazil in the finals of the Copa Sudamericana soccer tournament this week, has asked the organization in charge of South American soccer to award the trophy to Chapecoense, which had nearly all of its players and coaches killed in a plane crash on Monday night. Nacional said in a statement on its website and its Twitter feed that it had requested that the South American confederation, Conmebol, cancel the two-leg finals and declare Chapecoense the champion of the tournament, South America’s second-most prestigious club competition. “Atlético Nacional calls on Conmebol to award the title of the Copa Sudamericana to Chapecoense for its huge loss, and in posthumous homage to the victims killed in the accident,” the team said in a statement. The competition’s organizers acknowledged that the request had been made after the “unanimous agreement” of Nacional’s players. On Monday, Chapecoense was flying to Medellín, Colombia, for the first leg of the finals when its chartered plane crashed on the outskirts of the city, killing nearly everyone on board. The plane was carrying 77 people, and Colombia’s civilian aviation authority said that six people had survived the crash: three of the 22 players, two of the nine crew members and one of the 21 journalists accompanying the team.
sports/soccer,The teams in Brazil’s first division released a “statement of solidarity” with Chapecoense, volunteering to lend it players for the 2017 season. The teams also said they had issued a “formal request” to the Brazilian soccer federation that “Chapecoense not be subjected to relegation” for the next three years. “It is a minimum gesture of solidarity that is at our disposal,” the statement read. “But it is endowed with the sincere objective of reconstruction of this institution that Brazilian football has lost.” Brazilian soccer officials ordered all games in the country canceled for a seven-day mourning period beginning Tuesday, and around the world, other teams and leagues offered moments of silence before matches and  practice sessions. Teams and players used social media to offer their condolences to Chapecoense, a minor regional club whose rise to the country’s top division had led it to be described as the Cinderella of Brazilian soccer. As recently as 2009, the club was playing in Brazil’s fourth tier. Two years ago, it won promotion to the country’s top flight, and its berth in the Copa Sudamericana finals brought the promise of the biggest games in the club’s history. Juliano Belletti, a former defender for Barcelona, Chelsea and the Brazilian national team, said the club’s rise through the ranks had “brought joy and hope” to the entire country.
sports/soccer,The Italian club Torino and the English powerhouse Manchester United also posted poignant condolences on Twitter. Each club’s history includes its own air disaster: Torino’s team was decimated in 1949 when a plane carrying 22 players crashed into a mountain, and Manchester United met with a similar catastrophe in 1958 when 23 people died in a crash in Germany as the club returned from a European Cup game. One of the members of the Chapecoense squad on board the chartered flight was Danilo, a goalkeeper who was reported to have died at a hospital after being rescued from the wreckage.
technology,Uber and Lyft End Rides in Austin to Protest Fingerprint Background Checks - The New York Times Uber and Lyft were not bluffing. On Monday, the two leaders of the booming ride-hailing industry halted service in Austin, Tex., after losing a legislative fight over how they screen their drivers. The decision to leave an energetic city known for its young, well-educated population offered a stark illustration of how strenuously the companies oppose new rules that would require them to perform fingerprint background checks on drivers. Ending the service also meant that about 10,000 drivers would be out of work, Taylor Patterson, an Uber spokeswoman, said. “Folks are devastated,” she said. “People are saying, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to pay my rent.’” The legislative fight playing out in Austin, the Texas capital, has been watched closely by municipalities across the country as they ponder how to handle public-safety issues posed by the so-called sharing economy. Austin’s City Council voted in 2015 to require that the companies subject their drivers to fingerprint background checks, which could turn up criminal records. The regulation was fiercely opposed by the industry as unnecessary and less effective than its own system. Uber and Lyft, both based in California, responded by underwriting a nearly $9 million campaign against the ordinance that culminated with an up-or-down vote by Austin residents on Saturday. Nearly 56 percent voted to preserve the measure, which also includes requirements for identifying vehicles and data reporting. Both companies described the result as bitterly disappointing on Monday.
technology,“Unfortunately, the rules passed by the City Council don’t allow true ride-sharing to operate,” Lyft said in a statement. “Instead, they make it harder for part-time drivers, the heart of Lyft’s peer-to-peer model, to get on the road and harder for passengers to get a ride.” Lawmakers and some law enforcement professionals have argued that fingerprint checks, which are required of Austin’s taxi drivers, are the best way to establish a person’s identity and weed out those with criminal records. Uber has said that its own checks, performed by the third-party provider Checkr, include scrutiny of court records and other biographical information and are more effective than the fingerprint checks, which it said rely on incomplete federal databases. Industry experts have noted that the fingerprint rules, which go fully into effect next February, could pose a potentially time-intensive and costly new burden on the companies and their drivers. Yet Uber still operates in two cities that require fingerprint checks: Houston and New York. Ms. Patterson, the spokeswoman, said the company was in New York for good, but that it was pressing its case in Houston and could potentially pull up stakes there. Lyft left Houston in 2014. Last week in Miami-Dade County, after a battle of more than two years, transportation officials legalized ride-sharing services with no requirement that drivers be subjected to fingerprint background checks. David Butts, a political consultant in Austin who helped lead a campaign to preserve the new ordinance, accused Uber and Lyft of putting corporate strategy above public safety.
technology,“But we’re a progressive city,” Mr. Butts said. “We happen to believe that government has a role to play. And the idea that we’re just going to give them a blank check and say, ‘Self-regulate and we’ll take your word for it’ was not acceptable to the majority of voters in this city.” In addition to Uber and Lyft, at least three ride-hailing companies are operating in Austin, a center of technology that hosts the South by Southwest festival and is home to the University of Texas’ flagship campus. City officials said other companies were making inquiries on Monday after the announcements by Uber and Lyft. Get Me, a new ride-sharing company in Austin, said it had been asked repeatedly how it would respond if its larger rivals left. “The open and honest answer is, as it’s always been, we’re not going anywhere,” the company said in a statement on Facebook. Councilwoman Ann Kitchen, who led the effort to tighten the regulation of ride-hailing companies, said in an interview on Monday that the city was open to continuing talks with Uber and Lyft. “Of course, we have always said to Uber and Lyft that they are welcome here and we didn’t ask them to leave,” she said. “But we have got to respect the will of the voters.”
sports/football,Mistake-Prone Giants Make Titans’ Job Easy - The New York Times EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — In the moments after his team’s 29-10 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin was asked about his team’s 3 turnovers and 11 penalties, with six whistles for personal fouls. Without a word, Coughlin shook his head, filling the room with his simmering disgust. He was asked if he had ever had a team called for so many personal-foul penalties in one game, and Coughlin answered instantly: “Never.” When the subject turned to Eli Manning’s pivotal first-quarter interception, after his decision to recklessly flip a goal-line pass left-handed, Coughlin’s head was shaking again. When the topic was running back Ahmad Bradshaw’s crucial third-quarter fumble near the goal line, Coughlin was grim-faced and straight-lipped, his head again moving side to side. Someone brought up the Giants’ special teams, and Coughlin sputtered, “Horrible.” There was only one moment from Coughlin’s news conference that captured the mood more perfectly. At New Meadowlands Stadium, some fans are allowed to watch and listen to Coughlin’s postgame comments through a glass partition. As Coughlin mentioned that his players had prepared exactly as he had wanted, the fans booed heartily. The Giants’ plan against Tennessee had been long on redemption, a chance to purge their memory of last week’s embarrassing loss to Indianapolis on national television. In the wake of that game, there had been questions about the verve of the Giants’ leadership, and players responded by vowing to prove that one notably bad loss would not define the season.
sports/football,What unfolded on the field Sunday instead only raised more and different questions about what the Giants lack, like self-control. The Giants (1-2) played better in many facets, but their sloppy, unruly and thoughtless play undid every accomplishment. “I think we played good; we just didn’t play smart,” defensive end Justin Tuck said. “A team that turns the ball over and commits stupid penalties is usually going to lose.” The Giants’ first possession was eerily similar to others in their young season. Manning threw a pass that went in and out of the hands of wide receiver Hakeem Nicks, leading to an interception. Seven plays later, the Giants were behind, 3-0. The Giants drove the ball from their 17 to the Tennessee 2 on their next possession when Manning, after scrambling away from pressure in the pocket, attempted to toss the ball left-handed as he was being tackled. Tight end Kevin Boss, back in the lineup from a head injury, was the target, but this pass was also deflected and intercepted. “That is one of those things where everything is telling you to try to get him the ball, but you just have to know you can’t afford to have a turnover there,” said Manning, who completed 34 of 48 passes for 386 yards. Still, even with those errors, the Giants were dominating play on both sides of the line of scrimmage. The offensive line, missing center Shaun O’Hara, still had its best game of the season. And although the Giants’ penalties continued to mount, they managed to tie the game, 10-10, at halftime.
sports/football,But the wheels came off quickly for the home team after intermission. Marc Mariani returned the second-half kickoff 45 yards, and several plays later, a Titans punt pinned the Giants on their 1. On third down, Manning connected with Mario Manningham on a spectacular 43-yard sideline completion. But on the play, Bradshaw was penalized for a cut block on a rushing defender, an infraction that led to a safety because it occurred in the end zone. On the ensuing free kick, the embattled punter Matt Dodge hit a low, short kick that was returned to the Titans’ 49. “The field position we gave them over and over was inexcusable,” Coughlin said. Six plays later, Tennessee quarterback Vince Young, who completed 10 of 16 passes for only 118 yards, threw to Kenny Britt for a 13-yard touchdown and a 19-10 Titans lead. Still, the Giants roared back, with Bradshaw, who finished with 88 rushing yards, leading a drive that reached the Tennessee 6. Fighting for extra yardage, Bradshaw let the football get away from his body just long enough to have it poked free. The Titans were bailed out of difficult field position when Giants tackle David Diehl was whistled for unnecessary roughness just after Bradshaw’s fumble. The Giants’ defense, which benefited from tenacious tackling by the safeties and defensive linemen, forced a punt after three plays, and Manning moved his team into position for a 39-yard field-goal attempt. But the Giants’ field-goal team failed to snap the ball before the play clock expired — an error Coughlin blamed on Dodge, the holder — and after a 5-yard penalty, Lawrence Tynes missed his 44-yard attempt.
sports/football,As they had all game, the Titans pounced on the Giants’ mistakes, adding their own field goal. When they got the ball back, the Giants were moving again into Tennessee territory, but another potential scoring drive was thwarted by a personal foul when tackle Kareem McKenzie knocked down a defender after the whistle. It was McKenzie’s second unnecessary-roughness penalty of the quarter. Coughlin removed him from the game, and when McKenzie exited, he threw his helmet. At least it did not land in the stands  the way Brandon Jacobs’s did last week. Tennessee tacked on another touchdown as the Giants stewed on their sideline. In the end, it was the Giants’ 10th loss in their last 14 games, which left Coughlin red-faced and perturbed. “We all understand that we beat ourselves today,” he said, pausing as he searched for something else to say. “We have 13 games to go,” the coach said. “Obviously, we have to improve.”
us,Fatigued by the News? Experts Suggest How to Adjust Your Media Diet - The New York Times A cartoon circulating on social media captures the mood of many viewers and readers trying to cope with the current barrage of breaking news. The cartoon, by David Sipress, shows a couple walking together, with the woman saying, “My desire to be well-informed is currently at odds with my desire to remain sane.” It feels as if we are living in a Superconducting Super Collider of news, with information bombarding us at a head-spinning velocity. The result is a fatigue about the headlines — lately about politics — that has prompted some people to withdraw from the news, or curb their consumption of it. Christian Livermore, an American writer living in St. Andrews, Scotland, said in an email that since the presidential election, she has been skimming instead of deeply reading the news. “At a certain point, there’s a misery quotient that results from immersing one’s self in the news, in the almost forensic detail of the suffering, and I have to ask myself, ‘How does this affect my life?’” she wrote. Experts said they had not seen data to conclude that consumers had changed their habits to protect their mental health, but added that the news ecosystem had changed drastically over the past five years, accelerating the sense of information overload.
us,Dan Gillmor, a professor of media literacy at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the number of news media has increased sharply, while there has been an “incredible rise of the ubiquitousness of social media” and sharing of news on platforms such as Facebook. “Things really are different,” he said. “There’s just more stuff if we’re online and paying attention. There’s a lot to pay attention to.” He added that in today’s television news environment, the definition of breaking news “means the latest thing we have to show you.” Leslie-Jean Thornton, a journalism professor who is a colleague of Mr. Gillmor’s at Arizona State University, said that even faculty members who by necessity were steeped in news needed breaks from it. “As journalism professors, there’s a need and a desire to stay on top of things — so much so that it becomes somewhat addictive for some of us,” she wrote in an email. “It’s hard to step away, even for a few hours, but yet the constant wash of uncertainties is emotionally draining and physically harmful — teeth damaged from being clenched in anger or frustration, skyrocketing blood pressure, heart palpitations.” She added, “I joke that we need trauma care, but I’m not really joking at all.” Graham C. L. Davey, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Sussex in England, said in an email that many people followed the news because they did not want to be caught unaware.
us,“These are the people with an intolerance of uncertainty, and are probably already anxious individuals, and are exactly the ones for whom negative news has a negative psychological impact on their own personal anxieties and worries,” he said. As consumers become satiated, the news media responds by increasing the “emotionality” of its coverage, meaning negativity is emphasized to keep customers engaged, he wrote. Mr. Gillmor has been a proponent of the “slow news movement,” named after the slow food movement, which maintains it is better for consumers’ health to cook and eat more slowly. “We haven’t been asking anything of the news-producing group, namely journalists, who I would strongly argue should be more involved in managing the insane flow of information and misinformation,” he said. “It would be better if we had an approach that said, ‘Calm down.’” How then best to cope with the velocity and quantity of news? Some have found comfort in positive news, said Seán Dagan Wood, editor in chief of Positive News, a website and quarterly print magazine that highlights “quality independent reporting that focuses on progress and possibility.” In the 12 weeks since the election, visitors to the website have increased by 93 percent, and magazine subscriptions are up by 77 percent compared with the 12 weeks before the election, Mr. Wood said in an email. For those glued to the news, Curtis W. Reisinger, a clinical psychologist at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y., recommended not reading or watching any just before bedtime because thoughts of how to respond to it can disrupt sleep. Better to watch sports or entertainment rather than the “worry content” of news, he said.
us,Nir Eyal, who writes a blog about “behavioral design” — the intersection of psychology, technology and business — said he habitually turned to campaign coverage to momentarily distract him from his work and escape from “an uncomfortable reality.” What he found, however, was that he traded one uncomfortable reality (the demand to get his work done) for another (the addictive quality of watching the news for fear he was missing out on something). “The solution became the problem,” he said. In a recent blog post, “How to Stay Informed Without Losing Your Mind,” he noted that “online news is never done,” adding that reading it left him “overwhelmed, exhausted and anxious.” “The internet never says, ‘You’ve had enough, now go away,’” he wrote. Mr. Eyal has changed some of his habits; he has installed the News Feed Eradicator for Facebook and removed Facebook and Twitter apps from his iPhone, checking them only from his desktop. He has also taken to reading a daily newspaper because editors select the top stories and spare him from reading “the incomplete, incremental, second-rate stuff often published online.” “And when I physically turned the last page of the newspaper — such a satisfying moment — I felt as if I’d read enough to be informed for the day,” he said. If all else fails, and you still feel bouts of news fatigue, you can turn to Twitter for photos of cute animals.
t-magazine,At Monse, Dressing Up the White Shirt - The New York Times Even before Monse — a new fashion line helmed by the Oscar de la Renta alums Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia — debuted at New York Fashion Week, it had been worn by celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker, Selena Gomez and Amal Clooney. (Thanks, in large part, to the stylists Kate Young and Erin Walsh, who were early champions of the brand.) “The week before the show, it was like, ‘Oh my God, if we don’t pull this off, it’s going to be really embarrassing,’” remembers Kim during a recent visit to the pair’s SoHo studio. But the response from buyers and editors was immediately positive. Retailers including Net-a-Porter and Bergdorf Goodman began carrying the label, and Jessica Paré of “Mad Men” attended the Emmys in a fuchsia Monse gown. Since then, Kim and Garcia have been working on their second collection, which will show today at the High Line Hotel. They have again focused their collection around the white button-down shirt — which they use as a point of departure in everything from floor-sweeping gowns to cocktail dresses. “It was fun to take something that had an old, stale feel, and make it relevant for today,” says Garcia. “It wasn’t something that we already saw out there.” With their second presentation, both designers intend to expand on their first collection. Garcia notes that shirting will endure as one of Monse’s signatures — alongside new components such as drawstring detailing and embroidery.
t-magazine,Kim, 33, served as the studio director and head daywear designer at Oscar de la Renta during her 12-year tenure there, while Garcia, 28, spent six years there overseeing evening wear designs. Both left the label last spring shortly after the presentation of De la Renta’s final collection. The urge to strike out on their own felt especially timely for the young pair. “If we didn’t try it now, it would have been a missed opportunity,” says Kim. For both designers, collaboration has always been easy. “We complement each other’s ideas. Whenever she took care of something for day, I’d make sure there was an evening version, and so on,” Garcia says. That fluid symbiosis continues today at Monse, but there is an obvious departure from the aesthetic of their former employer: Monse designs are not messy, per se, but slightly undone — and deliberately so. “We want to keep it looking as unfussy as possible. As long as it looks like something she put on in five minutes and walked out the door — that’s the mood we want to convey,” says Garcia. (The brand takes its name from his mother’s first name.) With autumn layering in mind, the fall/winter 2016 collection includes many firsts for the brand: wool suiting fabrics, jackets, knitwear and slim, stretch lurex pants and tops. Sweaters featuring face-framing hoods are another fresh addition. “Our customers aren’t that conservative, based on what stores bought and what clients are ordering, so we’re going more adventurous,” says Kim.
t-magazine,Looking ahead, Kim and Garcia are considering the addition of a resort collection. They also hope to have e-commerce in time for their spring collection — since digital has always been a top priority. “Maybe it’s a generation thing, but when we look at fabric, we take a picture and look at it that way,” Kim notes. “Everything we see is through a screen now.”
us/politics,Fred Trump Taught His Son the Essentials of Showboating Self-Promotion - The New York Times The throngs of New Yorkers who poured into Coney Island on a sweltering Sunday in July 1939 — shuffling past the rides, hot dog stands and freak shows — confronted one last spectacle blaring just beyond the surf. At 65 feet and outfitted with enormous Trump signs, the yacht called the Trump Show Boat was hard to miss. And that was the point. Its loudspeakers blasted recordings of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “God Bless America” over and over, compelling many sunbathers, reluctant to be seen as unpatriotic, to stand and salute each time. When the boat floated swordfish-shaped balloons — redeemable for $25 or $250 toward a new Trump Home — toward the shore, bathers nearly rioted as they raced to snatch them up. Fred C. Trump, the owner of the boat and the master builder of solid homes in Brooklyn and Queens, is often considered a point of contrast to his flashy son Donald, the brash developer who built gilded towers in Manhattan, and became a tabloid fixture, television personality and now, Republican presidential nominee. But Donald J. Trump inherited more than just a real estate empire from his father. As a salesman, competitor, courter of politicians and controversy and, above all, as a showboating self-promoter, Fred Trump was the Donald Trump of his day.
us/politics,To demonstrate to potential homeowners the futility of renting, Fred wallpapered a model home in rent receipts. In newspaper advertisements for his Shore Haven apartments in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, he referred to himself under an illustration of the Statue of Liberty as “Fred C. Trump, acting as a free and rugged individualist to meet the basic need for shelter.” Decades before his son splashed the family name across his first tower, his father christened a grocery in Woodhaven “Trump Market,” and his Coney Island housing complex “Trump Village.” “He was a good salesman,” Mr. Trump said in a recent interview in his Trump Tower office. “He had some beautiful ads. Don’t forget that was our internet.” Mr. Trump’s childhood friends have said they see in him his father’s intensity, but also a constant and often palpable need to please and impress the patriarch who ruled his family with a firm hand. Even today, Donald Trump seems to bathe in his father’s approval. A framed photo of Fred Trump faces him on his cluttered desk. Asked what his father, who died in 1999, would have thought about his run for president, Mr. Trump, 70, said, “He would have absolutely allowed me to have done it.” Born in 1905 to German immigrants who spoke mostly German at home, Fred Trump was already working as a butcher’s delivery boy at age 10. While studying at Richmond Hill High School, he held down part-time jobs and pumped his brainy younger brother, John, who later went on to teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for summaries of assigned reading.
us/politics,“Daddy was interested in the reading of the books,” said John Trump’s daughter, Karen Ingraham. “Uncle Fred was more of the doer.” Before he turned 21, Fred Trump and his mother, Elizabeth, started the construction company E. Trump & Sons, so named because only she was old enough to sign the checks. The business took off. At age 28, he won the mortgage service business of a troubled German bank, and by 1938 was bragging in the papers about the “throngs visiting” his developments in Brooklyn. That year, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle referred to him first as a prominent Long Island builder, then as the “Henry Ford of the home-building industry.” His ego grew accordingly. He took pride in his intellectual abilities, daring people to stump him with enormous numbers to calculate. “He wanted to show that he could add them in his head,” said Barbara Giffuni, a daughter-in-law of Joseph Giffuni, another builder and one of Fred Trump’s good friends. But Fred Trump owed at least as much to federal housing programs, political connections and an influx of immigrants and veterans as he did to his brainpower. Almost as soon as President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Federal Housing Administration in the 1930s, Mr. Trump eagerly sought to make use of its loan subsidies. “The working classes have been fully awakened as to the benefits of homeownership under the F.H.A. 25-year mortgage plan,” he said at the time.
us/politics,To really get their attention, he attached price tags like $3,999.99. “One penny more and it won’t sell,” Mr. Trump said his father had taught him. While his Trump Show Boat promotions displeased the Parks Department, which slapped him with a summons for advertising without a license, Jeanette G. Brill, Brooklyn’s first female magistrate, imposed only a $2 fine. Mr. Trump boasted to The Eagle that “woman judges are far more sympathetic to the cause of F.H.A. Housing and far more appreciative of novel advertising ideas and good music than are the men judges.” The war broke out and Fred Trump moved his young family — his wife, Mary Ann, and three children, Freddy, Maryanne and Elizabeth — to Virginia, where he built more than 1,000 apartments for the Navy. He soon returned to New York and had two more children, Donald and Robert. He treated his extended family like business partners. On Sunday mornings, he would drop all of his children off at the house of his sister, Elizabeth, and ask his brother-in-law, who worked six days a week, to check his books. To avoid Fred, the family started attending an earlier church service, said John Walter, his sister’s son, who eventually did his uncle’s books. Fred brought that hard-charging approach home. While his oldest son, Freddy, crumbled under the pressure, Donald blossomed under it.
us/politics,Donald Trump said he learned his father’s values, and his killer sense of competition, by following him to building sites and watching him squeeze the most out of every dollar. “My father would go and he’d pick up the sawdust and he’d pick up the nails, the extra nails, and he’d pick up the scraps and he’d use whatever he could use and recycle it in some form or sell it,” Mr. Trump said Thursday in a speech to the National Association of Home Builders. He also saw his father’s tough negotiating style, even at home. One time some of Donald Trump’s friends were vexed why his wealthy father would not buy his son a new baseball glove. Mr. Trump said it was because his father suspected him, correctly, of playing dumb about the price of the mitt he wanted, and of trying to get the salesman to go along with it. Fred Trump’s projects housed thousands of G.I.’s and made him rich and powerful. Some tenants loved Mr. Trump for his solid, well-priced apartments; others loathed him for his suspected exclusion of blacks from his properties. (Woody Guthrie, a tenant of Mr. Trump’s Beach Haven apartments, wrote in 1950, “I suppose/ Old Man Trump knows/ Just how much/ Racial Hate/ he stirred up/ In the bloodpot of human hearts.”) In the 1970s, Donald Trump, who had just taken over the business, would fiercely contest a housing discrimination lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, before ultimately agreeing to change renting practices.
us/politics,And years before Mr. Trump became known for spreading campaign money around, regardless of party affiliation, he watched his father court Abraham D. Beame, who would become mayor, and the other power brokers of Brooklyn’s Madison Democratic Club. “In order to build you needed to get zoning, and in order to get zoning you had to know the politicians,” Mr. Trump said. “And my father got to know the politicians.” Mr. Trump, who is particular about his physical appearance, also takes after his father in other ways. He pointed out a picture of his father, immaculately dressed and coifed, in a book of family photos that his own children gave to him for his 70th birthday in June. “My father was very vain,” he said. There were differences. Donald Trump wanted to build in Manhattan. His father didn’t see the point. “This is nice and easy, what are you doing over there?” Fred would say to his son, according to Mr. Walter, who worked with his cousin and uncle. Mr. Trump ultimately eclipsed his father, though Fred Trump, who was married to his wife for more than 60 years, joked to his thrice-married son that the “one place you’ll never beat me is with the marriage stuff,” Mr. Trump said. In the last decade of his life, the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease slowed Fred Trump, according to his friends and relatives, and he died at the age of 93 with difficulty recognizing people.
us/politics,Mr. Trump said he wasn’t scared that the disease might be the last thing he inherits from his father. “Do I accept it? Yeah,” he said. “Look, I’m very much a fatalist.” At Fred Trump’s wake, at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home, his son stepped forward to address the political, real estate and society power brokers in the crowd. One attendee recalled Mr. Trump’s unorthodox ode to his father, which Mr. Trump confirmed. “My father taught me everything I know. And he would understand what I’m about to say,” Mr. Trump announced to the room. “I’m developing a great building on Riverside Boulevard called Trump Place. It’s a wonderful project.”
sports/olympics,For North Korean Skaters, the Short Program Was Just the Beginning - The New York Times GANGNEUNG, South Korea — Facing enormous pressure and scrutiny, North Korea’s only elite athletes at these Winter Olympics delivered the best performance of their career on Wednesday in pairs figure skating, helping to enliven a mostly subdued, half-empty arena. The skaters, Ryom Tae-ok, 19, and Kim Ju-sik, 25, have zero chance for a medal. But that is not their measurement of success. Their aim was to finish in the top 16 among 22 pairs in the short program, enabling them to participate in the long program on Thursday. They accomplished their goal, finishing 11th in the short program with a personal best of 69.40 points from the judges. Ryom and Kim come from the world’s most isolated nation, but, to a point, they appear open and expressive and embracing of outside influences. Their choice of music Wednesday was an instrumental version of the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life,” as performed by the guitarist Jeff Beck, and the mostly somnolent crowd responded by clapping along during the song’s signature tempo change. “We could really feel the power and energy of the Korean people,” Kim said before the skaters hurried through an interview area without stopping. Still, they were clearly elated with their performance. Ryom jumped into her coach’s arms as she left the ice, and the pair stood and pumped their fists when their score was announced.
sports/olympics,The skaters are the only two of the 22 North Korean athletes here to have qualified for these Games by merit instead of wild-card entry. Advancing to the medal round confirmed their arrival here via skill instead of largess. “They’re not even close to medal contenders,” said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent Canadian coach who has assisted the North Koreans over the last year. “But I’m so happy they’re here because they belong here. They’re a world-class level team.” The notion that Ryom and Kim have achieved some international success as individuals “in some respects sits uncomfortably alongside our image of North Korea as the premier collectivist state in which the individual has no role or influence,” said John Nilsson-Wright, an East Asia specialist at Cambridge University and Chatham House, a London-based think tank. “This question that many of us grapple with when we look at North Korea,” Nilsson-Wright said, “is to what extent as a sports person do you have the kind of autonomy and freedom and opportunity to express yourself as an individual in this very collectivist environment?” South Koreans have expressed complicated feelings about North Korea’s participation in these Olympics. But individual North Korean athletes appear welcome — none more so than Ryom and Kim, who have been the subject of endless curiosity. Ryom, with her ever-ready smile and red wool coat, might have been the most photographed athlete arriving at the Games.
sports/olympics,Some have found in her a comparison to another North Korean visitor, Kim Yo-jong — the sister of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un — who attended the opening ceremony and charmed the South Korea news media without ever speaking in public. “North Korea will probably use the performance of the figure skaters to boast how much North Korea is getting international attention, just as Kim Yo-jong got the media following her and demonstrated to its people that North Korea has reached a certain status in the world,” said Kim Kyung-sung, the president of the South and North Korean Sports Exchange Association. At practice on Tuesday, South Korean fans paid nearly $30 and filled the lower section of the Olympic ice arena, taking pictures with their smartphones and oohing, aahing and clapping as Ryom and Kim rehearsed their jumps, spins and lifts. “I hope they will connect us together,” said Cho Da-in, 20, a student who also had a ticket to Wednesday’s short program. “We are one blood.” Half an hour before Wednesday’s competition began, a North Korean news media contingent arrived, followed by a group of cheerleaders in their familiar red outfits, waving reunification flags. When the pair took the ice to warm up, the cheerleaders waved North Korean flags. A group of fans chanted the skaters’ names and held up a banner acknowledging them, while bearing another sign that said, “Because One Korea.”
sports/olympics,Han Mahn-chul, 59, a spectator and an engineering researcher from Seoul, the South Korean capital, said he was impressed that the North Koreans had qualified for the Games in a sport like figure skating. “It is kind of a sport that advanced countries excel at,” Han said. “That is the image it has. So the fact that a poor country like North Korea has good skaters is amazing.” Ryom and Kim are under tight control. When they arrive by bus at the Olympic arena, a security detail flanks them, standing arm to arm, as they enter the building. But unlike the country’s cheerleaders, they are not being kept totally apart from outsiders. The skaters waved jubilantly to the crowd before and after Wednesday’s routine. And on Tuesday, they walked without any monitors through an interview area, promising to speak more fully after the competition. “There have been no inconveniences whatsoever, when it comes to life in the South area,” Kim, who with Ryom is competing for the first time in South Korea, said on Wednesday. Around other skaters, Ryom and Kim have shown a playful side. Recently, in a waiting room before practice, the North Koreans and their coach rolled their gloves into a ball and played an impromptu game of soccer to get their bodies limber. On Feb. 2, when Ryom celebrated her birthday, Kim Kyu-eun, a South Korean Olympic pairs skater, gave her a gift of cosmetics. The North and South Koreans trained together last summer with Marcotte in Montreal, alongside pairs teams from Canada and the United States.
sports/olympics,Kim Hyon-son, the North Koreans’ primary coach, cooked kimchi for the South Koreans in Montreal. And Meagan Duhamel, a two-time world champion pairs skater and Marcotte’s wife, took the North Koreans shopping. “Everyone is really supportive of them,” said Alex Kam, the South Korean skating partner of Kim Kyu-eun. “It’s good to see how sports brings everyone together without boundaries.” In their few international competitions, Ryom and Kim have remained assured and composed, as they were on Wednesday. They finished 15th at the 2017 World Figure Skating Championships. Last September, they were self-possessed, if not flawless, in qualifying for the Olympics at a competition in Germany. There they traveled without security and sometimes left the rink unaccompanied by their coach or a team official. In a sport that forbids political displays, Ryom and Kim on Wednesday did not wear pins commonly worn by North Koreans, depicting the former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the grandfather and father of the current leader. Both skaters are listed on their official bios as students. They live in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, where the more privileged citizens live. At the qualifying event in Germany, Ryom declared, “I want to continue to improve until I become world champion.” There is considerable room for improvement. For one thing, the North Koreans, who seldom compete abroad, have found it challenging to train with three other Olympic pairs on the ice at the same time. There have been a number of near collisions.
sports/olympics,“One of the questions they ask me is, ‘What can we do to get better?’” Marcotte, the coach, said. “My first answer is, they need to compete more often. The more they are exposed to competition, they will understand what they need to get their scores better and the more familiar they will be to the judges.”
health,Donald R. Hopkins: How to Eradicate Guinea Worm Disease - The New York Times CHICAGO — In his home office, Dr. Donald R. Hopkins has statues of the Hindu smallpox goddess and the Yoruba smallpox god. And, floating coiled up in a glass jar, something that looks like a yardlong strand of capellini but is actually one of the last Guinea worms on earth. Smallpox is gone, and Dr. Hopkins played an important role in its death. Guinea worm disease — formally known as dracunculiasis, or “affliction with little dragons” — is down to fewer than 600 cases worldwide, from 3.5 million in 1986, when Dr. Hopkins began leading the drive to eradicate it. He took up the cause when he was at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and now runs it as the vice president for health programs at the Carter Center, the group founded by former President Jimmy Carter to advance human rights and fight disease. It has not been swift; several target dates for eradication have come and gone. Nonetheless, “I’m increasingly confident that it’s less and less likely that the disease will outlive me,” said Dr. Hopkins, who is 71. Nearly all the remaining cases are in South Sudan, which is newly independent and largely at peace. A few are in northern Mali, which is too dangerous for eradicators to work in right now but is becoming safer since French troops ousted Islamist rebels. Ethiopia and Chad, the other two countries with cases, are not at war.
health,Choosing a life’s work that requires visiting remote villages around the world seems counterintuitive for someone who, by his own admission, is terrified of snakes, rats, bats, airplanes, heights and food poisoning. Ernesto Ruiz-Tiben, Dr. Hopkins’s deputy and perhaps the only person who would still consider playing a practical joke on him, recalled sidling up behind his boss in a field of knee-high grass in Pakistan as he looked warily around for snakes. “I made a ‘ssssssss’ sound,” Dr. Ruiz-Tiben said. “Don almost turned white.” Told that story, Dr. William H. Foege — a former C.D.C. director and himself a legend of the war on smallpox — laughed aloud and said he remembered someone bringing a harmless garter snake to the C.D.C. offices to tease Dr. Hopkins with, and trying to say it was a gift from Dr. Foege. That Dr. Hopkins keeps going back to villages teeming with snakes “proves how important a professional challenge is to Don,” Dr. Foege said. “He’s one of the most tenacious people you’ll ever find.” Finding His Calling Dr. Hopkins attributes that tenacity to his Bahamian parents and to Coconut Grove, the neighborhood in Miami where he grew up; it was founded by islanders who sailed over in the 1880s looking for jobs in the new resorts springing up. He was one of 10 children of Joseph Hopkins, a carpenter, and Iva Louise Major Hopkins, a seamstress who made her children say their multiplication tables beside her sewing machine and recited the inspirational poem “Don’t Quit” to them.
health,“I had tons of cousins, aunts and uncles within a three-block radius,” Dr. Hopkins said. “It was definitely ‘It takes a village to raise a child.’ We didn’t rebel or get in trouble. It just wasn’t allowed. We were very serious about our studies, because of the high expectations.” He knew he wanted to be a doctor; he won a local science fair prize for a life-size clay model of the digestive system. Just 15 when he won a scholarship to Morehouse, the prestigious black men’s college in Atlanta, he had to quit his paper route to go. While at Morehouse, he won a travel scholarship and spent a year in Vienna, where he lived with a local family and came to love classical music while listening to operas for 12 cents in standing room. He saw only one other black person the whole year, he said. Adults were kind, he recalled, “but one little girl skipping along in the park took one look at me and screamed her head off.” Back in Atlanta, race relations were harsher. One incident “burned in my memory,” he said, was being with classmates on a bus in a white neighborhood, and the driver flagging down a police officer to order them to the back. (The officer refused, he said, saying, “You know the law — I can’t.”) He still remembers the moment he picked tropical medicine. On a winter break trip to Egypt, he saw flies swarming on children’s faces, and later learned they transmitted trachoma, an eyelid infection that cause blindness.
health,In medical school at the University of Chicago, he was the only black student in his class. A tropical disease professor rescued him from a boring summer job dissecting sheep hearts and nudged him into worm disease research. After graduation, he joined the Public Health Service, because he wanted to go to Africa, and to avoid being drafted for the Vietnam War. In 1967, Dr. Foege asked him to lead the smallpox effort in Sierra Leone, which then had the world’s highest case rate, and test a new strategy: Instead of trying to vaccinate the whole country, teams would race to new outbreaks, vaccinating around each in widening circles until it died out. The strategy worked so well, Dr. Hopkins said, that Sierra Leone was smallpox-free in less than two years. It took a decade more to eradicate the disease globally, but that was “a big morale boost.” After a stint fighting smallpox in India, he returned home, taught tropical medicine at Harvard and rose through the C.D.C. ranks, ultimately retiring as acting director in 1987. The Eradication Process At the time, leading public health experts had a lofty dream: getting clean water to everyone on earth. Dr. Hopkins suggested a more modest goal: Guinea worm, a plague of the rural poor, could be eliminated by simply filtering existing water. The worms have been torturing humans since before history began. A calcified one has been found in an Egyptian mummy.
health,People become infected when they drink from ponds containing tiny freshwater crustaceans, known as copepods, that themselves have swallowed microscopic worm larvae. The larvae escape being digested by either the crustacean or the human, and grow inside the body to about a yard long. They then migrate to the skin — usually in a foot, but sometimes a hand, a breast or even an eye socket. Then they exude a burning acid to create a blister, which they burst through. As soon as the victim dips the inflamed area in cooling water, the worm (described by Dr. Hopkins as “a giant uterus”) squirts out millions of larvae, starting the cycle anew. Eradication relies not on a vaccine, but on simple filtering technologies and huge networks of local health workers. Those workers do many tasks. They find cases, treat ponds with a copepod-killing pesticide and teach families how to filter their drinking water. Workers also help victims inch the worms out, keep the wounds sterile and assure they do not reinfect local water. Dr. Hopkins excels at building those networks, finding local leaders to run them, and keeping health ministers focused even as the years pass. Mr. Carter backs him up, using his prestige as a former president, telephoning African presidents to urge them to keep the pressure on or even flying to Africa to tour villages where the worm persists. In 1995 he negotiated a four-month truce in the Sudanese civil war that became known as the Guinea worm cease-fire.
health,Now, with cases dropping steadily, Dr. Hopkins is optimistic. When programs are well run, he said, progress can be rapid; Ghana went from 501 cases to none in 18 months. In a telephone interview, Mr. Carter was full of praise for Dr. Hopkins, saying, “We could not have gotten here without him,” and adding, “I have a promise from Don that he won’t retire until the last worm is gone.” Dr. Hopkins had an answer: “If I even wanted to retire, exactly what would I say to President Carter? He’s 17 years older than me, and still going. He’s a tough man.” His list of awards is long, and offbeat. He won a MacArthur “genius” grant in 1995 and is now on the MacArthur board. He was knighted by Mali. He was presented with a tassel-covered horse by a Niger chief (he stayed on just long enough for a photo and then quietly regifted it to the local Guinea-worm team). In his office, he has two award plaques with pump handles on them — a reference to John Snow, the father of epidemiology, who traced a London cholera outbreak to one contaminated pump and halted it by removing the handle. And he has nearly 30 pictures or carvings of woodpeckers, birds he has liked since he saw them in his grandmother’s oak tree; when his Carter Center subordinates do particularly good work, he inks the reports they have written with a rubber woodpecker stamp.
health,Asked if he ever became discouraged as the fight dragged on, Dr. Hopkins recounted a conversation he had about 25 years ago, shortly after arriving in India to fight smallpox: “I met a guy who said, ‘You guys can come here with your West African experience, but I’m Indian and I know my country and we’re never going to get rid of smallpox here.’ ” “But we did,” he added. “So I’m sort of immunized against skepticism.”
business/economy,Conflicting Economic Indicators Challenge Fed’s Policy Makers - The New York Times WASHINGTON — The contrast between the improving health of the labor market and the weakness of other economic indicators poses a challenging quandary for the Federal Reserve. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, and other officials have said the Fed must raise its benchmark interest rate as job growth continues to prevent higher inflation down the road. The strength of the January jobs report — including faster wage growth — suggests the Fed’s policy-making committee still could raise rates as soon at its next meeting in March. But the Fed would be betting on a theory. Inflation remains low, growth has slowed and the impact of global economic problems and financial market volatility is unclear. If the Fed presses ahead, it could undermine the economy just as things are getting good for the vast majority of Americans. “My message to the Fed regarding this recent, long-awaited acceleration in wages is ‘Love it and leave it alone,’  ” said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who previously served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “If we want working people to benefit from the expansion, the last thing you’d want to do is tap the brakes — especially given the absence of inflationary pressures.”
business/economy,The Fed raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis. It had held rates near zero for seven years to encourage borrowing and risk-taking. Ms. Yellen, speaking after the announcement, said the Fed planned to raise rates gradually, reducing those incentives because the economy no longer needed quite as much help. She will speak publicly for the first time since then on Wednesday when she testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. In the intervening two months, the economic outlook has deteriorated. Financial conditions have tightened and the dollar has gained strength, weighing on American exporters and delaying any rebound in inflation. The January jobs report, however, reflects considerable strength in other parts of the economy. Stronger wage growth is particularly likely to grab the Fed’s attention, suggesting that employers are finally being forced to compete for workers by raising pay. In a high-profile example, Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, has said that it plans to increase hourly pay rates for most of its employees later this month. The Fed is less likely to worry about the slower pace of job creation in January, as officials have predicted that slower population growth would weigh on job creation. In keeping with those expectations, the unemployment rate still fell to 4.9 percent. One reason the Fed is focused on job growth is that it may be a more accurate reflection of the strength of the underlying economy. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for example, the government estimated the economy added 279,000 jobs a month, but that output increased at a rate of just 0.7 percent.
business/economy,Jason Furman, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in an analysis on Friday that the output figures probably reflected some measurement error. “This illustrates the importance of focusing on a wide range of indicators — especially labor market data, which tend to be less noisy — in assessing the health of the economy,” he said. One wing of the Fed sees an undiminished case for raising rates. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and one of the 10 Fed officials voting on the direction of policy this year, said this week that the Fed “should continue the gradual adjustment of moving rates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation.” She also played down concerns about the economic impact of recent market volatility. “While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted,” she said, “monetary policy cannot respond to every blip in financial markets.” Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and another voter, said on Thursday in New York that it was “premature” to change her economic outlook. “At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy growth in real disposable income, suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound,” Ms. Mester said. “Until we see further evidence to the contrary, my expectation is that the U.S. economy will work through the latest episode of market turbulence and soft patch to regain its footing for moderate growth.”
business/economy,Other Fed officials, however, say the volatility has given them pause. William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a close adviser to Ms. Yellen, said in an interview with Market News International this week that he was worried about the economic impact of jittery markets. “If those financial conditions were to remain in place by the time we get to the March meeting, we would have to take that into consideration in terms of that monetary policy decision,” Mr. Dudley said. And Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been particularly outspoken in warning that global pressures will weigh on domestic growth, told The Wall Street Journal this week that “recent developments reinforce the case for watchful waiting.” Investors, oddly, have walked away from this debate feeling confident that the Fed will not raise rates in March. Indeed, asset prices tied to expectations about the future level of short-term interest imply only about a 50 percent chance of any rate increase this year. That contrasts sharply with the Fed’s own prediction in December that it planned to raise rates by about one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four discrete steps. Many analysts have taken a more measured position, predicting that the Fed is less likely to move in March, but that it will still raise rates two or three times this year. Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said on Friday he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, instead of three times, and to start in June, instead of March.
business/economy,Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the continuation of low inflation probably meant Fed policy makers would hesitate at their next session. “Were the meeting held tomorrow, we still think the Fed would stay on hold — primarily because of concerns about inflation and inflation expectations,” he said. “But it would be an uncomfortable hold.”
international,A NATION CHALLENGED: MILITARY ANALYSIS; Routine Start In Novel War - The New York Times The principal aim of the airstrikes unleashed today is to tilt the balance of power within Afghanistan against the Taliban and give American-led forces unchallenged command of the skies for the difficult mission to come. American and British forces attacked the standard targets: command posts, air defenses, aircraft, electrical plants and terrorist training bases in bombing and cruise missile attacks, which Pentagon officials indicated could last a week or more. But this is the easy part. The more difficult task will be hunting down Osama bin Laden and helping the anti-Taliban foes within Afghanistan install a new government. In effect, the airstrikes were a conventional start to an entirely unconventional conflict. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld signaled as much today when he told reporters that the ''so-called war'' was notably different from previous conflicts that American forces had fought with Iraq and Serbia. As Mr. Rumsfeld put it, ''In this battle against terrorism there is no silver bullet.'' The United States' adversary is a hodgepodge of forces with unsophisticated arms and loose command and control. Nonetheless, they are a threat, and the Pentagon leadership is not assuming that its foes will become fragmented under the initial bombardment. The forces commanded by Afghanistan's radical Islamic Taliban number about 40,000 to 45,000 fighting men of uneven quality, military analysts say. They have been supported by an Arab unit known as the 55th brigade that are thought to number several thousand men recruited by Mr. bin Laden. That unit has been an important arm of the Taliban's war with their rival, the Northern Alliance, which controls a small portion of northern Afghanistan.
international,The Taliban forces have also included students from Pakistani religious schools and -- according to some reports -- former Pakistani military men. The Taliban force ranges from young men who have been forcibly conscripted to career Afghan military officers. For years, the Pentagon has said that its goal in military operations is to target a foe's ''centers of gravity'' -- those command centers, troops or military industries that are vital to their ability to run the war or stay in power. But the Taliban is such a decentralized and rudimentary fighting force that Mr. Rumsfeld has scrupulously avoided talking about centers of gravity in Afghanistan, a country whose infrastructure was never sophisticated and which has endured continuous war. Still, the Taliban have major vulnerabilities, which the air attacks are trying to exploit. The Pentagon's hope is that the combination of the psychological shock of the airstrikes, bribes to anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan covertly supported by Washington and sheer opportunism will lead many of the Taliban's fighters to put down their arms and defect. Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban, has tried to counter those efforts by appointing more reliable commanders. Neutralizing the loyal Taliban forces is a key war aim for the United States. The first step is to destroy the Taliban's air defense so that the United States and British aircraft can range freely over Afghanistan. The Taliban's air defenses are far more modest than the integrated air defense systems of Iraq or Serbia.
international,The Taliban's air defenses include radar-guided SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missiles, which are a threat to high-flying aircraft, and antiaircraft artillery, which can target aircraft at medium and low altitudes. Another danger is Stinger and other shoulder-fired missiles -- or ''man-pads,'' as the man-carried, portable weapons are known in Pentagon jargon. The Central Intelligence Agency distributed Stingers to help the Afghans fight their Soviet invaders more than a decade ago. The Pentagon is not sure if they are still operational. But a senior military officer said the Taliban has an estimated 200 to 300 man-pads. The United States military has considerable experience in targeting surface-to-air missile batteries, but it is difficult to destroy all of the Taliban's antiaircraft guns and virtually impossible to eliminate the threat from shoulder-fired weapons. Those weapons pose a special danger to helicopter-borne commando forces, but they can reduce the risk that the weapons present by using flares to deflect the missiles and by flying at night and close to the ground. Another objective is to destroy the Taliban's air force, which consists of a handful of Soviet-made miG-21 fighters and SU-22 attack planes. The Taliban have no ability to do precision bombing, and their combat planes are no match for American warplanes. But the Taliban's air assets are a threat to the Northern Alliance, which has no air force, as well as to the C-17 transport planes that America is using to drop food supplies.
international,In an echo of the United States military operation in Kosovo, American war planners are also hoping to use rebel fighters -- in this case, the Northern Alliance -- as a proxy force. The Northern Alliance has been on the losing end of the Afghan civil war, but Washington is now trying to alter that by covert assistance and overt military attacks against the Taliban's military abilities -- its arsenal of tanks, artillery and combat systems. The decision by the United States to intervene on the side of the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban groups poses a dilemma for the Taliban. If Taliban fighters go into hiding, their opponents will advance. If the Taliban forms a defensive line against its foes, it will itself become an inviting target to American war planes, as the Taliban found out today when some of its armored vehicles were hit in northern Afghanistan. In keeping with the Pentagon's philosophy of bringing the war to the enemy command in the opening round, strikes were also conducted against the Taliban's headquarters in Kabul and, more importantly, in Kandahar, the southern Afghan city that has long been the Taliban's political headquarters. They were almost certainly evacuated, but the Pentagon likes to show its foe that they do not have a sanctuary. These are relatively traditional missions. Tracking down Mr. bin Laden and his fellow terrorists on their home turf will be more difficult, more prolonged and potentially far more risky. The task is expected to involve American and British commandoes.
international,But Mr. Bush counseled patience. As Mr. Rumsfeld put it, ''We are in the early stages of ongoing combat operations.''

nyregion,Sandy, of All Things, Has Helped Open Access to Jersey Shore - The New York Times MANTOLOKING, N.J. — Alex Staal never saw this town at its worst, submerged and ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, 90 percent of its homes damaged by the storm. He started visiting only two years ago, and what he knows is a vast sandy expanse for relaxing and refreshing dips in the Atlantic Ocean. And the need to move his car every two hours. “It gets so annoying,” Mr. Staal, 44, of Philadelphia, said, referring to the town’s two-hour parking limit. He recalled scampering across the scalding-hot midsummer sand to move his car and momentary mental lapses that have earned him more than a half dozen tickets. But as the federal Army Corps of Engineers replenishes this town’s beach and builds new dunes, one of the obligations of benefiting from taxpayer-funded beach reconstruction is ensuring that the beaches can be used by, well, taxpayers. So the town is proposing doubling the parking limit to four hours and expanding the number of parking spots. “The state is basically being very adamant that anybody can access the beach,” said Lance White, the town council president in Mantoloking. A battle over beach access has raged for generations along the Jersey Shore as wealthy enclaves have fought to keep their beaches uncrowded and free of day trippers. Restrictive tactics include imposing parking permits, adding parking meters, creating private beach clubs, limiting facilities for bathers and raising fees for badges that allow access to the beach.
nyregion,But the destruction that Hurricane Sandy caused nearly five years ago has produced a bit of a silver lining. The sand and construction provided by the Corps of Engineers comes with a catch: They will be made available only to public beaches, and parking and pathways to the beach must be accessible. So up and down the 127-mile coastline, in areas hit the hardest by the storm, beach access for the first time in years is slowly becoming easier. “As part of the Corps’s project and all the easements, all the new beach that’s being built as part of those easements, a requirement was it had to be open to the public,” said Ray Cantor, the chief adviser for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, which works with the Corps of Engineers. “There’s a lot more beach and a lot more area that’s resulting in public access.” Mr. Cantor cited Loveladies on Long Beach Island as a community that was known for putting up obstacles to the beach but has added parking and better access, though organizations like the Surfrider Foundation argued the plans weren’t sufficient. Many condominium complexes across the state that once claimed beachfront property as private have had to make it public after replenishment projects. Yet the shift has been uneven. Restoration work sometimes requires the closing of beaches, funneling people to nearby beaches and creating more crowding and access issues. “That’s why I think there’s been a surge in towns trying to control parking recently,” said Andrew Chambarry, a co-chairman of the Surfrider Foundation’s Jersey Shore Chapter.
nyregion,Indeed, not every town is welcoming an influx of “shoobies” or “bennies” — pejorative terms for day trippers — to their glistening shores. In the tony enclave of Deal, where the beach bungalows of Asbury Park give way to mansions seemingly plucked from the Hamptons, residents have been battling to keep beaches to themselves, despite work by the Corps of Engineers. It began in 2015, when residents promoted an ordinance requiring parking permits that could be obtained only by residents, basically barring outsiders from the beach. That prompted an outcry, and the idea was shelved. This year, the town has proposed a $100 parking permit, available to anyone and mandatory for parking near the main access point to the beach. Those plans have been strenuously opposed by Mr. Chambarry, who grew up spear fishing off the shore in Deal and is also a lawyer. He filed petitions against the ordinance and spoke out at town meetings, presenting studies that poked holes in the town’s arguments. He argued that claims that residents needed permit street parking were bogus and that homes near the beach had spaces for an average of 10 cars. The potential to choke off parking by charging such a high price with no guaranteed parking spots for out-of-towners infuriated surfers, swimmers and fishermen alike. “It’s just another way for the locals to privatize the coastline,” said Michael Connor, 26, who lives in Rumson and has been surfing since he was 6. He noted that Deal was one of the few surfing breaks in New Jersey that worked well in the summer and said installing any parking permit process would force surfers to ever shrinking spots.
nyregion,“We have a friend that lets us park in northern Sea Bright,” Mr. Connor said. “If we weren’t friends with her, there’s only maybe 10 to 15 parking spots in that town. It’s getting more and more difficult each year to just get to the beach.” Surfers and fishermen can claim at least a temporary victory in Deal, as the town reportedly dropped its plan for parking permits. There are other tactics that frustrate many beachgoers. Countless towns rely on metered parking. In Mantoloking, while the parking changes are welcome, rules prohibiting food on the beach remain. And nearly every beach requires a paid badge of some sort. But parking remains the biggest issue. Glenn Rossi, the owner and operator of Used to Be’s, one of the few bars in the Mantoloking area, looks at a full parking lot outside his bar on the weekend and cringes, he said. “A lot of people try to park here and just go to the beach, without coming inside,” he said. He does not have the time, nor the desire, to police his own lot of about 40 spaces. But if his patrons can’t find a spot, they’re out of luck; there’s nowhere else to park nearby. The new parking spots would be a welcome salve, though. With so many people flocking to the Jersey Shore every weekend, overcrowding and precious parking are just a fact of life. “There’s no real way to stop it,” Mr. Rossi said. “This is, after all, ‘public access.’”

world/middleeast,To Maintain Supply of Sex Slaves, ISIS Pushes Birth Control - The New York Times DOHUK, Iraq — Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown to her next rape. During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent her days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter’s breath, the disgusting sounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she was tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist’s child. It was the one thing she needn’t have worried about. Soon after buying her, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips of pills, one of them colored red. “Every day, I had to swallow one in front of him. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was sold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,” explained the girl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control. It is a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an obscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure that the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with her.
world/middleeast,Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was practiced during the Prophet Muhammad’s time integral to the group’s operations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi religious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the fighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can continue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them. More than three dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed to be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters used to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and sometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion in order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do so. Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were driven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone, whose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with apprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser’s child; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping them. The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing being assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant of it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some of the women’s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees observed: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who have sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern Iraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to Dr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.
world/middleeast,It is a stunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman is between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times the rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads the Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where the victims are being treated. “We were expecting something much higher,” he said. The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first initial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy ponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to inquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not pregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof. That was not enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the date of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a delay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to start bleeding. Even then, he seemed unsatisfied. Finally he came into her room, closed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she was about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on her upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.
world/middleeast,“To make sure you don’t get pregnant,” she recalled him saying. When he had finished, he pushed her back onto the bed and raped her for the first time. Thousands of women and girls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the jihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In the months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a community now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from their former homes. Many of the women interviewed for this article were initially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent. All the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside members of their family. In its official publications, the Islamic State has stated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just about any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a pamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant slave is functionally the only protection for the captured women. The Islamic State cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can have sex with her only after she has undergone istibra’ — “the process of ensuring that the womb is empty,” according to the Princeton University professor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on the topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a child’s paternity.
world/middleeast,Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued that the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence whenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one menstrual cycle, according to Brill’s Encyclopedia of Islam. In its own manual, the Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also quotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that it was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for other means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period. A total of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed over three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters insisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others violated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed closely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was that women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given contraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were less versed on the rules. J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the Islamic State’s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. “Each month, he made me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,” said J., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.
world/middleeast,“On top of that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, ‘We don’t want you to get pregnant,’” she said. When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the Syrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man’s mother who escorted her to the hospital. “She told me, ‘If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,’” J. said. “They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like centrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About 30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn’t pregnant.” The fighter’s mother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant, validating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly. When that fighter tired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not take her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without ascertaining whether she was carrying another man’s child. Several other women reported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control by some of their owners but not by others. However, the low pregnancy rate, say medical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy were more likely to have been applied than not. In his office in Dohuk’s Ministry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing the treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low pregnancy rate.
world/middleeast,In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war, it has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies — either because the attackers did not use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because they purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68 Croatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant. With more than 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib’s center has treated only 35 pregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. “Even higher than that, if you consider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over many months,” Dr. Taib said. “I concluded that either they did an abortion before they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions, then there would have been physical signs,” which would have been noted by the gynecologist treating the returnees, he said. “There were no signs.” The prohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes that the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims, who dreaded carrying their rapists’ children. Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who was kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she had been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used her as an interpreter. One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young Yazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150 milligrams of Depo-Provera.
world/middleeast,Over the months that followed, she said, she escorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and later in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own teenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters. She explained the conflicted feelings she had at the time. “ISIS took our girls as slaves, only for sex,” Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief. “No one wants to carry the child of their enemy.” Others described how the fighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to abort. Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time of her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his slave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause her to miscarry. “She hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren’t looking, she spit them out,” said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of his sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries she suffered. “They wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the woman.” A 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel nauseated soon after her abduction. “The smell of rice made me gag,” she said.
world/middleeast,Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one of the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to location and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by then befalling most of the young women held alongside her. Despite being repeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she, too, was eventually picked. Her owner took her to a house, shared by another couple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he knew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with her, and when he did he appeared drugged. “I was telling him: ‘I’m pregnant. In your book it says that you can’t do this.’ He had bloodshot eyes. He acted like he was high,” she said. Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim of making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the surgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior suggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to abort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself. When he drove her home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property’s wall. “My knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn’t walk,” she said.
world/middleeast,Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was spirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out that she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety. Her first child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.
business,California Teacher’s Fund to Divest of Gun Stock - The New York Times One of America’s largest pension funds began on Wednesday to divest itself of firearms holdings, a response to the schoolhouse shooting in Newtown, Conn., that other pension funds could follow. The California State Teachers Retirement System, known as Calstrs, voted unanimously to begin its formal divestment process. The vote occurred at a public meeting where teachers said they did not want their retirement nest eggs placed with companies like the Freedom Group, the maker of the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that authorities say Adam Lanza used to kill 20 first graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school on Dec. 14. “This latest incident, which occurred at a school and involved fellow educators and the children we cherish, is a tipping point for Calstrs,” said Harry Keiley, chairman of the fund’s investment committee. Divestment involves several steps, to make sure fund officials comply with their fiduciary duty to protect the assets being accumulated for teachers and retirees. It took Calstrs several years to divest its tobacco holdings. Mr. Keiley predicted the firearms industry would come under market pressure that could make it an unsound investment. The move puts the California teachers’ fund at the forefront of a movement to reconsider whether investing in firearms is an appropriate way for states and cities to cover the retirement costs of their workers. Since the shootings, officials of other public pension funds, including those in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, have said they were searching their portfolios for firearms investments. But some of them have also expressed concerns about their fiduciary duties.
business,“We can’t manage the pension fund based on whatever the hot issue of the moment is,” said Thomas P. DiNapoli, the sole trustee of New York State’s pension fund for state and municipal workers in a radio interview. He said he had found weapons holdings worth about $15 million, out of a $150 billion portfolio and was still deliberating over what steps to take. “There are big questions about gun manufacturers, and where we’re headed as a society,” he told WNYC. In addition to the Freedom Group, the California teachers’ pension fund has investments in two other gun companies, Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger, according to the fund’s chief investment officer, Chris Ailman. The amounts are small, about $12 million, out of a total portfolio of about $154 billion. But all three companies make guns that private citizens are not allowed to own in California, according to Mr. Ailman, who was asked to provide detailed information on firearms investments to the pension fund’s trustees. The stocks of publicly traded weapons companies can swing sharply in response to news events. They fell after the Newtown shootings, leaving investors with losses and an uncertain outlook. Many pension investments in gun companies have been made through private equity partnerships, which usually run for many years and are hard to leave early without taking a loss. Officials of several pension funds with stakes in the Freedom Group said that in keeping with the usual practice in private equities, they were not told in advance that their money would finance a firearms business.
business,The private equity company that owns the Freedom Group, Cerberus Capital Management, has already said it would sell the gun business and return to investors the money they had put into it. Cerberus said this would protect the investors’ financial interests while keeping them out of the gun-control debate, which it said in December was “more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so.” It added, “That is the job of our federal and state legislators.” But one trustee of the teachers’ fund, California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, said state laws and the fund’s own investment rules necessitated a formal divestiture. He made the motion to design and execute a plan to divest of all companies that make guns that are illegal in California. When he was state attorney general from 1998 to 2006 he clashed with the National Rifle Association over the enforcement of California’s gun laws, which are widely seen as the most strict of any state. The state teachers’ fund also requires its investment analysts to consider if a company makes a product so detrimental to human health “that it draws significant product liability lawsuits” and “avoidance by other institutional investors.” The rule was added in 2008, when the fund was divesting of tobacco interests. Mr. Lockyer said it was applicable to makers of large-capacity ammunition clips and assault weapons, which “pose extreme dangers to public health and safety.” 
business,Mr. Lockyer also sits on the board of Calpers, California’s pension fund for state and municipal workers. He is expected to make a similar motion when that $243 billion fund holds an investment meeting next week. An official of the Los Angeles pension fund for police and fire fighters said one of its trustees had also sought an evaluation of how its investment in the Freedom Group comported with its investment policies. The Los Angeles Police Department is also a customer of the company. Connecticut’s treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, who is the sole trustee of that state’s pension fund, said the fund’s only stake in a weapons manufacturer was in Alliant Techsystems, which sells ammunition. But she said she was also looking for potential problems among companies that sell and distribute weapons. New York City’s five pension funds — which were valued at $127.8 billion in September — contain nearly $18 million in weapons and ammunition companies, the city comptroller’s office said. The comptroller, John C. Liu, said in a statement that the funds “are reviewing their holdings in gun manufacturers and are considering all options, including divestment, to ensure that public pension dollars do not support weapons that can destroy a community in the blink of an eye.” But other public pension funds, including those in Idaho and Texas, said they did not consider the investments an issue.
books/review,CHILDREN'S BOOKS - The New York Times THE THREE QUESTIONS Based on a Story by Leo Tolstoy. Written and illustrated by Jon J. Muth. Unpaged. New York: Scholastic Press. $16.95. (Ages 6 and up) THERE have always been for me a small handful of children's books that if taken to heart can be quietly life-changing. ''The Cat Who Went to Heaven,'' by Elizabeth Coatsworth, a gentle story of compassion and mercy, is one; ''The Marzipan Pig,'' by Russell Hoban, a bittersweet love story infused with irrepressible joie de vivre, is another. Now, happily, along comes ''The Three Questions,'' by Jon J. Muth, to add to my list. ''The Three Questions'' is based on a short story by Tolstoy in which a czar, by unknowingly saving his enemy, comes to understand the best way to live his life. Muth's retelling retains the questing and questioning premise while changing the characters, plot and setting in ways that will suit a younger audience. It begins, riskily enough, by posing a set of decidedly abstract questions that at first seem more suited to a philosophy class than a picture book. A boy named Nikolai stands in the misty shallows of a mountainous world flying a red kite, a bright spot of color in an otherwise dreamy blue landscape. Nikolai is in the middle of an inner debate. He wants to be a good person but doesn't ''know the best way to do that.''
books/review,Nikolai has three questions: When is the best time to do things? Who is the most important one? What is the right thing to do? His three friends -- Sonya, the heron, Gogol, the monkey, and Pushkin, the dog -- each have an answer. In answer to the first question, Sonya advises Nikolai to ''plan in advance''; Gogol tells Nikolai he must ''watch and pay close attention''; and Pushkin argues that you need a group of friends to ''keep watch and help you decide when to do things.'' A ponderous way to begin a tale for children? Not really, because Muth, whose illustrations for children's books include ''Come On, Rain!'' and ''Gershon's Monster,'' has a wonderful sense of comic timing. Immediately after Gogol answers, a coconut falls on the monkey's head; despite his own good advice, he has not been paying close attention. In answer to ''Who is the most important one?,'' Sonya declares it is ''those who are closest to heaven,'' and Gogol, rubbing his bruised head, thinks it's ''those who know how to heal the sick.'' Pushkin, a realist, answers that it's ''those who make the rules.'' And the third question, ''What is the right thing to do?,'' elicits the answers ''flying,'' ''having fun all the time'' and ''fighting'' from the three animals.
books/review,Dissatisfied with his friends' self-absorbed answers, Nikolai resolves to ask Leo (named after Tolstoy, of course!), a wise and ancient turtle who lives alone in the mountains. Nikolai arrives to find Leo digging in his garden, but when the boy poses his questions, the turtle, in the manner of a Zen master, declines to answer. So Nikolai takes the shovel from Leo and begins to dig the garden himself, an action whose symbolism will not be lost on an alert reader. Just as Nikolai finishes his work in the garden, a sudden storm comes up. As boy and turtle make a dash for cover, they hear cries for help coming from the forest. Nikolai runs to the rescue of an injured mother panda and her baby and carries each of them back to Leo's cottage. Why pandas? readers may wonder, even as they smile at the picture of Nikolai staggering under the weight and bulk of the mother. The answer lies in how the black-and-white pandas function in pictorial counterpoint to the red kite. As the soaring red kite has come to be associated, through the design and layout of the cover and early pages of the story, with the three questions, so the pandas, in their unequivocal black-and-whiteness, are a bold narrative and visual element that indirectly lead Nikolai to what he seeks. The morning after the storm, Nikolai still believes he has not found the answers. ''But your questions have been answered,'' Leo tells him, pointing out that if Nikolai had not stayed to help in the garden, he would not have been there to rescue the pandas when the storm struck.
books/review,Leo explains: ''Remember then that there is only one important time, and that time is now. The most important one is always the one you are with. And the most important thing is to do good for the one who is standing by your side. . . . This is why we are here.'' The last picture shows the red kite soaring into the mist as the distant silhouettes of boy, turtle, heron, monkey and dog form a companionable parade down the mountain, a striking visual end to a thought-provoking tale. The influence of a Zen way of thinking and doing, with its emphasis on intuition and koanlike questioning, runs through ''The Three Questions'' in a fresh, unforced way. And, in fact, in an author's note at the end of the book, Muth tells how he sought out Tolstoy's story after seeing it mentioned in a book by a Vietnamese Zen master. Readers of all ages will be drawn to ''The Three Questions.'' While the deeper philosophical implications of the story may sail over the heads of younger children, they will delight, nevertheless, in the charming but dignified anthropomorphic demeanor of Sonya, Gogol, Pushkin and Leo. For older children, the story dramatizes the common fantasy of heroically coming to the rescue of people (or pandas) in need of help. And busy adults will be struck by Leo's simple injunction to be in the present moment, always the most important one.
books/review,Muth has succeeded in pushing the narrative boundaries of the conventional picture book to include the essential philosophical and moral dimension of Tolstoy's original tale. In lesser hands, the result might have been leaden indeed. But Muth's simple, straightforward narrative, amplified by exquisite watercolor paintings, easily carries the story's abstract dimension. ''The Three Questions'' presents a world of moral consequence and choice, where questions of right and wrong must be puzzled out and where each person's actions really do make a difference. Young and old readers alike will take heart from that.
world/europe,Chastised by E.U., a Resentful Greece Embraces China’s Cash and Interests - The New York Times ATHENS — After years of struggling under austerity imposed by European partners and a chilly shoulder from the United States, Greece has embraced the advances of China, its most ardent and geopolitically ambitious suitor. While Europe was busy squeezing Greece, the Chinese swooped in with bucket-loads of investments that have begun to pay off, not only economically but also by apparently giving China a political foothold in Greece, and by extension, in Europe. Last summer, Greece helped stop the European Union from issuing a unified statement against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. This June, Athens prevented the bloc from condemning China’s human rights record. Days later it opposed tougher screening of Chinese investments in Europe. Greece’s diplomatic stance hardly went unnoticed by its European partners or by the United States, all of which had previously worried that the country’s economic vulnerability might make it a ripe target for Russia, always eager to divide the bloc. Instead, it is the Chinese who have become an increasingly powerful foreign player in Greece after years of assiduous courtship and checkbook diplomacy. Among those initiatives, China plans to make the Greek port of Piraeus the “dragon head” of its vast “One Belt, One Road” project, a new Silk Road into Europe. When Germany treated Greece as the eurozone’s delinquent, China designated a recovery-hungry Greece its “most reliable friend” in Europe.
world/europe,“While the Europeans are acting towards Greece like medieval leeches, the Chinese keep bringing money,” said Costas Douzinas, the head of the Greek Parliament’s foreign affairs and defense committee and a member of the governing Syriza party. China has already used its economic muscle to stamp a major geopolitical footprint in Africa and South America as it scours the globe for natural resources to fuel its economy. If China was initially welcomed as a deep-pocketed investor — and an alternative to America — it has faced growing criticism that it is less an economic partner than a 21st-century incarnation of a colonialist power. If not looking for natural resources in Europe, China has for years invested heavily across the bloc, its largest trading partner. Yet now concerns are rising that Beijing is using its economic clout for political leverage. Mr. Douzinas said China had never explicitly asked Greece for support on the human rights vote or on other sensitive issues, though he and other Greek officials acknowledge that explicit requests are not necessary. “If you’re down and someone slaps you and someone else gives you an alm,” Mr. Douzinas said, “when you can do something in return, who will you help, the one who helped you or the one who slapped you?” The Trump administration, recognizing it has a geopolitical and economic challenger, recently intervened to help lift an American deal over a Chinese competitor — and the Greeks seemed happy to play one power off the other.
world/europe,E.U. officials are concerned that China is buying silence on human rights issues and undermining the bloc’s ability to speak with one voice. Analysts say China targets smaller countries in need of cash, among them Spain, Portugal and others that suffered in the financial crisis. Hungary, where China is pledging to spend billions on a railway, also blocked the E.U. statement on the South China Sea. Many analysts have noted that Greece’s human rights veto came as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras returned from a summit meeting in Beijing in May, where he signed billions of euros’ worth of new investment memorandums with Chinese companies. Greek officials insisted that, despite all the Chinese investments, the country identified with, and was loyal to, the E.U. and did not do China’s bidding. Some European officials are not so sure. “The Greek government needs to choose where its alliances lie and realize the E.U. is not only a market, but first and foremost a community of values,” said Marietje Schaake, a prominent member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands. Over the summer, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tightened rules to limit takeovers of German strategic assets, a move aimed at Chinese state-backed firms. As Ms. Merkel put it to a German newspaper after Greece’s vote blocking the condemnation of Chinese human rights violations, Europe “has to speak with China in one voice.” She added that China’s economic might allowed it to pressure weaker European nations. “Seen from Beijing,” she added, “Europe is an Asian peninsula.”
world/europe,In January 2015, Greek voters shook Europe by electing the radical leftist Syriza party and its leader, Mr. Tsipras. He had campaigned to end the austerity measures of the E.U. and halt privatizations like the port of Piraeus. Boisterous protesters spilled into Athens, waving Syriza flags and denouncing the European power centers, Brussels and Berlin. But it was Beijing that became quietly nervous. China’s years of laborious and expensive spadework in Greece suddenly seemed imperiled, especially its investments in Piraeus. Immediately after Mr. Tsipras took office, the Chinese ambassador, Zou Xiaoli, became the first foreign official to pay him a visit. Mr. Zou pressed Mr. Tsipras to honor the previous Greek government’s commitments to privatize Piraeus, according to several people with knowledge of the meeting. Back in Beijing, Chinese officials expressed displeasure, and the state-run news media ran articles questioning Greece’s friendship with China. Less than a week later, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, telephoned Mr. Tsipras to make sure there were no more misunderstandings. In response, Mr. Tsipras and his deputies announced an “upgrading of relations between Greece and China.” Within weeks, three Chinese frigates arrived in Piraeus port. At a ceremony, Mr. Tsipras affirmed Greece’s intent to “serve as China’s gateway into Europe.” Even as Berlin and Brussels grow wary of Chinese investment, Greece may not care, after suffering under German-enforced austerity attached to the international bailouts that have kept the country afloat since the 2010 debt crisis.
world/europe,In 2010, as creditors demanded the gutting of pensions and sharp tax increases, the Chinese offered to buy toxic Greek government bonds. In 2013, as Greece became increasingly subject to creditor budget restrictions, the Chinese spent freely on Greek assets. In turn, Greece has sometimes been a voice in the room at the E.U. for China on sensitive issues — although government officials insist Greece remains loyal to the bloc and to NATO, and is only seeking to strike a balance in a shifting world. As for scuttling the E.U. statement on China’s human rights violations — the first time in a decade the bloc was silenced — government officials said Greece viewed the E.U. approach as “unproductive.” After the vote, China’s Foreign Ministry applauded “the relevant E.U. country for sticking to the right position.” Along more than 20 miles of coastline outside Athens, a forest of cranes at the Piraeus port load and unload thousands of containers from China and around the world. An ultramodern floating dock is scheduled for arrival in November from China. A planned new Chinese-financed passenger hub is also in the works. China has transformed Piraeus into the Mediterranean’s busiest port, investing nearly half a billion euros through the state-backed shipping conglomerate Cosco. It hopes to make Piraeus the entry point to Europe under its One Belt, One Road project. Chinese goods would travel along a new network of railways and roads radiating up through Central European nations, with the prized destination being Germany, where China invested $12 billion last year alone.
world/europe,In the middle of the port, Chinese, Greek and E.U. flags flutter in front of the headquarters of Cosco, which now controls the entire waterfront through its 67 percent stake in the port. “It’s a kind of neocolonialism without the gunboats,” said Mr. Douzinas with a chuckle. Greek officials note that, unlike democratic nations that change politicians every few years, the Chinese have a long and steady strategic view. “They know what they want,” said Stergios Pitsiorlas, the Greek deputy economics minister and one of the government’s point men dealing with China. Cosco has brought around 1,000 jobs to the area, but it has outfitted cargo docks with cranes made in China, not in Greece, and expanded the docks with building materials from China. And as Greece struggles through record joblessness, the company has used subcontractors to hire around 1,500 workers mostly on short-term contracts at wages far below what unionized Greek dockworkers are paid. “There are more workers, but they earn less income,” said Giorgos Gogos, the general secretary of the Piraeus dockworkers union. Yet Greece needs any jobs, and leaders are counting on more Chinese investment. Fosun International Holdings, a Chinese conglomerate run by Guo Guangchang, often referred to as China’s Warren Buffett, is spending billions of euros with a consortium with Greek and Arab investors to convert an abandoned former airport on the seaside outside Athens into a posh playground three times the size of Monaco for moneyed tourists. The project, Hellenikon, is part of a bigger plan to bring over 1.5 million Chinese tourists to Greece during the next five years.
world/europe,Mr. Tsipras has swept aside regulatory hurdles, clearing two large refugee camps installed in the former airport, and quashing attempts by members of his own party to delay construction because of concerns the project might pave over ancient archaeological sites. “That also has been unstuck,” said Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, the Greek economy minister. After World War II, the benefactor showering millions on Greece was the United States, courtesy of the Marshall Plan. America’s role in Greece wasn’t always popular — especially its support for the country’s military dictatorship during the Cold War — but the United States was regarded as the gold standard for economic opportunity. Not so much anymore. When former President Obama visited Greece last November on his final foreign trip, some Syriza officials, bitter that his administration had not intervened more forcefully during the financial crisis, mocked his speech as a funeral oration for his own legacy, worthy of Pericles. Privately, Mr. Obama’s advisers said the trip also served to demonstrate, somewhat belatedly, American engagement in Greece in the face of Russian meddling in the region. But it was China that was most deeply entrenched. Eliot Engel, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described a “free-for-all for rogue countries” in Greece. “We see it with Russia and we see it with China,” he said as he attended a July 4 party at the United States ambassador’s residence in Athens, part of a congressional delegation that had come to drum up business for American companies. “That’s why it’s so important for America to be engaged in the world.”
world/europe,Mr. Tsipras is trying to play both sides. Having traveled twice in a year to Beijing to meet the Chinese president and attend One Belt, One Road forums to draw investment, he has recently welcomed American businessmen and promoted Greece’s recovery to American lawmakers. In May, when Fosun and two other Chinese companies bid to take over a major Greek insurer, the United States commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross, intervened to help push the deal into the hands of Calamos Investments, a Greek-American consortium whose chief executive is a backer of President Trump. The Exin Group, a Dutch partnership with Calamos, eventually won the bid. “He sent us a letter asking us to look at Calamos,” said Mr. Papadimitriou, the economy minister. Any deal, Mr. Ross implied in the letter, “could be the beginning of more investments in Greece,” Mr. Papadimitriou recalled. Some Greek government officials cited Fosun’s defeat as evidence that Athens wasn’t under China’s sway. “We are sensitive to being viewed as someone else’s colony,” said Panagiotis Kouroumblis, Greece’s maritime minister. “Nothing can move forward without the agreement of the Greek state.”

politics,THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CONTEXT; With No Room to Maneuver, Grim Choices for Nassau Chief - The New York Times What  Gov. George W. Bush did today was an extraordinary turnabout. After weeks of objections to the debate schedule that the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates had been proposing, he suddenly agreed to all of it: three encounters with Vice President Al Gore, on the dates that the commission proposed, in the locations that the commission specified. He even agreed to Boston, which his advisers had dismissed as a Democratic stronghold that stacked the deck against their candidate. But by the time Mr. Bush's representatives sat down with the debate commission's officials today, they really had no other choice. They had to cut their losses and stop the regular pounding that Mr. Bush had been taking in the news media for what looked like a nervousness about formal debates. And they had to move on, because a continuing debate over debates threatened to be yet another distraction for a campaign bedeviled by too many of them. They knew that for Mr. Bush to communicate his chosen message to voters, he had to put an end to the extraneous story lines. ''The campaign recognizes that it has to get back on offense, back on its own agenda, and out of the muck,'' said one prominent Republican strategist. Today's agreement spoke volumes about the change in the Bush campaign's fortunes over the last several weeks. Before, Mr. Bush enjoyed a considerable advantage over Mr. Gore in the polls, and for a front-runner, debates always represent more of a risk than an opportunity.
politics,But Mr. Bush now seems to be trailing by a few percentage points, and for an underdog, debates hold the promise of mixing up the dynamic, changing the momentum. ''Bush needs debates,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, ''because with debates, you can shake up the political environment.'' Debates also represent one of the rare times when a candidate can speak directly to an enormous number of voters, without having to rely on the conduit of journalists, and for Mr. Bush, that is more attractive than ever before. The last several weeks have demonstrated to him and his advisers just how unpredictable the 24-hour news cycle is and how quickly reporters can latch onto a mistake or a surprise that has nothing to do with what a candidate is peddling, and yank him off course. That has happened to Mr. Bush again and again, and those mishaps coupled with the realignment of the candidates in the polls, changed the narratives associated with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. All at once, it was Mr. Bush who could not gain his footing, and Mr. Gore who loped with an unbroken stride. For the 90 minutes of a debate, however, there is no commentary, no interpretation: just the candidates saying what they choose and, if they don't stumble, what they want the voters to hear. ''This is Bush's chance to get his message out unfiltered, uncensored, unedited,'' Mr. Luntz said. ''And that's exactly what he wants. And that's exactly what will get his campaign back on track.''
politics,Mr. Bush had wanted debates that were less formal, and shorter. His aides had proposed having only one 90-minute commission debate, and two 60-minute ones on television news programs. The news program debates would not have been carried by all the major networks. Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, insisted today that he might still get his wish for a more spontaneous exchange between the candidates. As the candidate played hard to get, she said, the debate commission grew agreeable to talking about creative, spontaneous formats for the debates. But the Bush campaign has not received any firm agreement along those lines. So Mr. Bush and his advisers appear to be taking something of a gamble, worth it to them now because the holdout had not worked to their advantage, any further holdout may bring only them more grief, and they need to move their focus to putting Mr. Gore on the defensive. ''The last couple of weeks have not been pleasant, and I think there was a desire not to allow this cloud to linger any longer,'' said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. A Bush campaign adviser said that while events had clearly been moving toward an agreement on debates, today's deal may well have been sealed by the emergence of newly critical appraisals of Mr. Gore's fund-raising efforts. At last, the Republican official said, Mr. Gore was on the hot seat. And Mr. Bush's advisers knew that if they did not reach an agreement on debates today, they might help Mr. Gore out of that uncomfortable spot by keeping Mr. Bush in one.
politics,''This decision was locked in by the fact that Bush finally got some traction, after weeks of no traction,'' the official said. ''They don't want to take that away.'' And with less than two months to go before Election Day, they may not be able to afford to.
sports/golf,England’s Andrew Johnston Is an Obscure Figure With an Unforgettable Presence - The New York Times TROON, Scotland — His name is Beef. If you did not know that — and as he is ranked 104th in the world, you could be forgiven if you didn’t — all you had to do was listen to the fans near the first tee at Royal Troon on Saturday. Or the ones alongside the second fairway. Or the ones behind the third green. Everywhere the Englishman Andrew Johnston went here during the third round of the British Open, the unusual (and unusually loud) calls from the crowd broke through the relative calm of the golf tournament like a rogue meat vendor trying to draw attention at an organic market. “Beef’s here!” a middle-aged man screamed. “We love Beef!” a younger woman screeched. “Uncle Beef!” a 5-year-old girl yelled. (She was Johnston’s niece, Summer.) “I said in a Sky Sports interview yesterday that I was going to have a Caesar salad for dinner last night,” Johnston recalled after shooting a one-under-par 70, “so some geezer went around shouting, ‘Caesar salad!’ at me for like six holes. That was weird.” (Full disclosure: Johnston, who estimated he weighs 16 stone, or about 225 pounds, did not actually have a Caesar salad on Friday night. He had a pizza, though he quickly added that it had been only about 10 inches wide. “It wasn’t like a 20-inch, ‘Win a T-shirt if you finish it’ type of thing,” he said.)
sports/golf,While Henrik Stenson (12 under par) and Phil Mickelson (11 under) were the leaders on Saturday — and will be again on Sunday — Johnston, 27, who begins the final round in fourth place at five under, is clearly the people’s choice. The reasons are manifold: He has a remarkable beard, the sort that is so bushy you wonder if he might keep tees or scorecard pencils in it (it could also be used to warm small children). He has an enigmatic nickname, which he explained was given to him at age 12 by a friend who thought Johnston’s long, curly hair — he is one-quarter Jamaican, he said — looked like “a big bit of beef.” He is also an underdog, playing in only his third major championship and, as recently as three years ago, was pondering giving up professional golf because he had been playing so badly he wasn’t sure he had enough money to buy Christmas presents. Most important, however, is this: He smiles. Many top golfers keep their heads down during a round, their eyes locked on their target, or their ball, or their caddie. Even between shots, nothing breaks their singular focus. There might be a brief nod or a tiny waggle of fingers to an adoring spectator, but little else. Johnston grins. He looks up. He waves. He laughs. During the few moments before he actually steps in to hit a shot, he does not acknowledge fans who (continue to) shout his name, but, he said: “Once I’ve hit the shot or I’m walking somewhere, I’m going to acknowledge it, man. Because I don’t need to concentrate then.”
sports/golf,Sergio García played with Johnston on Saturday. García, who is from Spain, always has plenty of support from the European crowds (and did again in this round), but even he conceded that Johnston’s growing following had been difficult to miss. “Any characters in our game are good,” García said. “And he is a character.” Few would disagree. Johnston grew up outside London, turned professional in 2009 and bounced around several smaller tours for a few years before winning twice on Europe’s second-tier tour in 2014. His first brush with fame came in April, in part because he won the European Tour’s Spanish Open, and in part for what he said afterward, when asked for his reaction. Referring to his home course, North Middlesex Golf Club, he said, “I can’t wait to get back to North Mid, get hammered and see my mum and brother.” (He did exactly that, while wearing what appeared to be some sort of bird costume. There is video to document the events.) At Troon, Johnston’s tournament began on Thursday with what he described as a complete shank of a shot on the fourth hole — “I haven’t hit one like that since I was, like, 12” — but he bounced back from that double bogey and shot a two-under 69. Another 69 on Friday, which also featured several fans waving hamburgers at Johnston, put him among the leaders. On Saturday, he reveled in the attention while producing some spectacular golf. On the 13th hole, Johnston holed out his chip for a birdie that sent the crowd into ecstasy and Johnston’s mother into tears.
sports/golf,“That got me going a bit,” Johnston said. “I was like: ‘Oh my God, don’t look at Mom. Please, Mom, go over there.’” Johnston has battled some nerves as the biggest tournament of his career has gone on, but he is hardly paralyzed. After his rounds, he has spent time with his family, including his sister and his niece, who are visiting from the United States. On Friday night, he posted to Instagram a video of Summer examining his beard (she called it “lumpy”). The night before, he admitted that Summer had whipped him in a match of Top Trumps, which involves a deck of cards that have cats on them and, according to Johnston, is “a proper kid’s game.” On Sunday, after a possible rematch with Summer, Johnston will go out in the second-to-last group and attempt to chase down Mickelson and Stenson. He said he believed he could win — “Because why play if you don’t back yourself?” — but he was also planning to soak in the moment, just as he did at the end of his third round. The standing ovation he received was long and loud, and Johnston putted out with a smile that was as wide as the brim of his hat. He held his putter aloft. He nodded his head to every corner of the grandstand. And then he walked off toward the scorer’s tent, the calls of “Beef! Beef!” reverberating above the din.
world/middleeast,Saudi-Led Coalition Resumes Bombing of Yemeni Capital After Talks Collapse - The New York Times SANA, Yemen — The military coalition led by Saudi Arabia significantly stepped up its bombing campaign in Yemen on Tuesday, striking the capital, Sana, and killing 21 people across the country, most of them civilians, according to medical and security officials in three provinces. Health ministry officials in Sana said the dead included 10 civilians, all employees of a potato chip factory, with 13 others wounded at the factory in the al-Nahda neighborhood. The international airport in Sana was shut by the airstrikes after Saudi coalition officials notified airlines that incoming flights would be barred for 72 hours, said Khalid al-Shayef, the airport director. It was the first time in five months that Sana was bombed by warplanes from the coalition, which also includes the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, Sudan and other Middle East countries. It came after peace talks collapsed on Saturday between the Houthi militias that dominate the capital and the largely exiled government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the coalition and Western powers. Saudi Arabia intervened after the Houthis seized power, prompting Mr. Hadi to flee the capital. The Saudis accuse the Houthis of working on behalf of their archrival, Iran. The swift escalation of airstrikes and the closing of the airport happened when many Houthi officials were outside the country, and they were unable to return to Sana by air from Kuwait, where the peace talks were held.
world/middleeast,Numerous violations of the cease-fire have been reported on both sides in recent months, including airstrikes in some areas. But while peace talks were going on, the capital had largely been spared from the sort of heavy bombing that characterized the early stages of the Saudi-led intervention, which began in 2015. The coalition launched airstrikes on Sunday in Nehm District, northeast of Sana. Reports said 18 civilians were killed there. In northern Sada Province, close to Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia, nine people were killed in two airstrikes that hit homes, according to Muhammad Hajar, the director of the al-Jumhori Hospital, which is supported by Doctors Without Borders. In central Ibb Province, three people were killed in two airstrikes that struck a house and a gas station, according to the provincial health director, Abdulmalik al-Sanani. It was the first time Ibb was bombed since last April. In the Red Sea province of Hudaida, another coalition airstrike hit a government intelligence building late on Monday, killing four, who were presumably Houthi officials, and wounding 28 others, according to a security official in the province. He asked not to be identified because of military restrictions on news statements. Brig. Gen. Ahmed al-Asiri, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, could not be reached for comment on Monday or Tuesday. On Monday, a spokesman for the Yemeni military, Samer al-Haj, speaking from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said that coalition and Yemeni government forces had begun an offensive to drive the Houthis from Sana, saying only military action would persuade the Houthis to come to terms.
world/middleeast,In southern Yemen, officials loyal to the government of Mr. Hadi said on Tuesday that Qaeda extremists had pulled out of the city of Azzan in Shabwa Province. Azzan was Al Qaeda’s last stronghold in the province, and the extremists apparently abandoned it in fear of an impending military operation by Yemeni forces supported by the Saudi-led coalition, according to Col. Awadh al-Dahbool, the head of Yemeni military security in the province. Their departure was announced in messages to military officials and the local civilian council. “I think they deserted the city after hearing about an imminent military operation, so they decided to leave to save their lives, as they did in Hadramout,” Colonel Dahbool said. He was referring to Al Qaeda’s retreat from the important city of Mukalla in Hadramout Province on April 24. The war in Yemen has gone on for 15 months, claiming more than 6,500 lives and provoking a humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of severely malnourished children and more than half of the population no longer able to feed itself adequately. It was already one of the poorest countries in the Arab world before the war began.
sports/tennis,Ana Ivanovic, 2008 French Open Champion, Stays Calm in Wind - The New York Times PARIS —  At the scene of her greatest triumph, Ana Ivanovic is revisiting the sort of winning she has not achieved in years. The seventh-seeded Ivanovic defeated 19th-seeded Elina Svitolina, 6-3, 6-2, Tuesday afternoon, advancing to the semifinals of the French Open. It is Ivanovic’s first Grand Slam semifinal in seven years, since she won her lone major title here in 2008. “I don’t know if I should feel really old or really happy,” Ivanovic, 27, said in her on-court interview. A resurgent season a year ago carried her back into the top five, but Ivanovic had struggled this year since hurting her toe in Australia in January. In the year-to-date rankings compiled by the WTA, Ivanovic was 27th entering the tournament. “It’s been a long road and hard work,” she said. “Today was a very, very tough match, even though the score doesn’t indicate that. It was tough conditions — it was obviously for both of us — but very, very gusty. I really tried to just execute my game plan and tried to move more, because in the windy conditions, that’s what you have to do.” The wind seemed to more hinder Svitolina, who was playing in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. She grew frustrated at times when she failed to connect on her shots. Ivanovic kept reloading, no matter the outcome of the previous point, and ended the match with 28 forehand winners.
sports/tennis,Ivanovic said that managing her stubborn streak of perfectionism had allowed her to relax and make strides back to the level of play that she had reached with considerably more ease in the nascent stages of her career. “Ever since I was a young girl, even in school, I was always a perfectionist, and I always wanted to do my homework as soon as I got home,” she said. “Everything had to be done properly. “And you know what? When you have tough times and when you learn you can’t be perfect in every situation, it’s hard to accept, you know, because I still do expect that. But you just have to, because, you know, it’s not about the situation. It’s how you deal with it. You always have a choice. “Now I really try to forgive myself sometimes and to accept it and to move on.” Ivanovic will next face 13th-seeded Lucie Safarova, who beat her in the third round of the French Open a year ago. Safarova, who reached her first Grand Slam semifinal last year at Wimbledon, beat 21st-seeded Garbiñe Muguruza, 7-6 (3), 6-3. Safarova and Muguruza managed to deploy their powerful games effectively through the crosswinds. Safarova connected on several backhand down-the-line winners at critical moments in the first-set tiebreaker and on her first match-point opportunity. “The wind was turning, and it was taking the ball to all sides,” Safarova said. “I just tried to be good on my feet and tried to find the right pace and not going for bigger lines and going for bigger targets.”
sports/tennis,With her flat, left-handed strokes, Safarova has proved a tricky matchup for Ivanovic. After Ivanovic beat Safarova in the second round of her 2008 title run here, Safarova reeled off five wins in a row over Ivanovic, despite being the lower-ranked player in each meeting. Ivanovic ended Safarova’s streak of winning last fall in Tokyo, but Safarova still leads over all, 5-3.
world/europe,Thousands Protest Ukraine’s Rejection of Trade Pacts - The New York Times KIEV, Ukraine — Tens of thousands of people marched through downtown Kiev on Sunday to protest the government’s decision last week to abandon far-reaching political and free trade agreements with the European Union and instead focus on improving economic ties with Russia. Waving European Union flags, as well as the flags of Ukraine’s main opposition parties, a sea of demonstrators chanting “Ukraine is Europe!” marched from Shevchenko Park through Independence Square, the main site of Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution, and on to European Square for a rally in front of Ukrainian House, a well-known building that houses a convention center. Clusters of riot police officers were deployed along the route, drawing jeers from marchers but not interfering with the event. “For young people, the future is brighter with Europe,” said Maria Lyskenko, 20, a student, who stood with her friend, Alyona Zorina, also 20, holding a sign that said, “Europe = Future Ukraine.” Ms. Zorina said that President Viktor F. Yanukovich was acting out of selfishness and self-interest in deciding not to sign the agreements with the European Union. “He’s more interested in his own business dealings with Russia,” she said. The political and trade accords, which had been in development for more than four years, had been scheduled to be signed later this week at a major conference in Vilnius, Lithuania. But, on Wednesday, the Ukrainian government announced that it had suspended its plans to complete the agreements.
world/europe,On Sunday evening, several thousand protesters were engaged in a standoff with a phalanx of police outside the Cabinet of Ministers building. Some tussled with the officers, who were wearing gas masks, and tear gas was sprayed, but it was unclear whether the police or protesters had used it. At one point, a lit flare was thrown at the police in gas masks who were blocking access to the building, and a flagpole was knocked down. The police reacted with restraint and there were no immediate reports of arrests. Some demonstrators, however, said that tension was building. “The situation in society is boiling,” said Svyatoslav Tseholko, a television host and chief projects editor of Ukraine’s Channel 5, who attended the demonstration wearing a blue-and-yellow ribbon. “And we don’t know when is the time the top will pop off.” Mr. Tseholko was urging demonstrators outside the Cabinet of Ministers building to remain calm and not resort to violence against the police, but he said that he understood the crowd’s anger over the decision to back away from the accords under pressure from Russia. “It’s a sign that Ukraine can lose its statehood; it can lose its independence,” he said. “And if we lose our independence, we lose everything.” In a sign of solidarity with the protesters, one of the country’s main news sites, Ukrainska Pravda — Ukrainian Truth — changed the name at the top of its home page to Evropeiska Pravda: European Truth.
world/europe,Blue and yellow were the colors of the day, as some marchers wrapped themselves in the sky-blue and pale-yellow flag of Ukraine, while others wore the dark-blue flag with yellow stars of the European Union. “Ukrainians want to live as Europe,” said Wladimir Klitschko, who was standing in at the rally for his brother, the boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, who is a member of Parliament and leads the political party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform. (Its acronym, UDAR, spells a word meaning “punch.”) “I am confident that together we will get there,” Wladimir Klitschko said. “And I am certain that we will win.” Ukrainian news agencies reported that Vitali Klitschko was out of the country to celebrate his daughter’s birthday and had tried to return for the protest, but his plane was unable to land in Kiev because of bad weather. Some demonstrators said the protests would continue at least until Friday on the slim hope that Mr. Yanukovich will resurrect the agreements and sign them. On Friday, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said that harsh terms set by the International Monetary Fund for a financial aid package were the “last straw” that led to ditching the agreements. But critics said the reason was intense pressure from Russia, which had maneuvered forcefully to derail the agreements. Another crucial factor was the country’s domestic politics. As a condition for signing the accords, European officials had demanded the release of Ukraine’s jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a main rival of Mr. Yanukovich’s.
world/europe,In addition to Mr. Klitschko’s party, the main participants in Sunday’s demonstration were Ms. Tymoshenko’s party, called Fatherland, and the nationalist party Svoboda. Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the leader of Fatherland in Parliament, called on Mr. Azarov and Mr. Yanukovich to reverse the decision and renew Ukraine’s pursuit of European integration. But Mr. Yatsenyuk said he had little hope of them doing so. “They genuinely hate Ukraine and democracy,” he said. While Mr. Azarov told lawmakers that the government’s only choice was to abandon the agreements, given the country’s financial troubles, Mr. Yanukovich, who plans to run for re-election in 2015, has said little about the decision, though he has issued statements saying that Ukraine will remain on a path toward European integration. The conflicting statements are characteristic of Ukraine’s often inscrutable politics and its increasingly untenable position between the competing demands of Europe and Russia. According to European officials, Russia threatened to retaliate with trade sanctions that would have been particularly damaging to eastern Ukraine, a main base of support for Mr. Yanukovich. President Vladimir V. Putin and other Russian officials have denied strong-arming Ukraine. Mr. Putin said he had merely pointed out that a free-trade agreement between Ukraine and Europe would require Russia to take steps to prevent its market from being flooded with cheap European goods. The Kremlin has urged former Soviet republics that have been in talks with Europe, including Ukraine and Moldova, to instead consider joining a customs union that Russia has formed with Kazakhstan and Belarus.
magazine,The President Wants You to Get Rich on Obamacare - The New York Times Tom Scully bolted through the doors and up the stairs to a private dining room on the third floor of the “21” Club. Scully, 56, is slightly taller than average and has tousled graying hair, an athletic build and a lopsided smile. He typically projects a combination of confidence and bemusement, but on this rainy September afternoon, he was frenzied. Scully was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at an event hosted by the Potomac Research Group, a Beltway firm that advises large investors on government policy (tag line: “Washington to Wall Street”). Today’s discussion centered on the most significant change in decades to the nation’s health care policy, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. As Scully walked to the front of the room, some 50 managers from hedge funds, mutual funds and private equity firms tucked into the round tables. Others gathered in the hallway. A hush of anticipation hung in the air. During the past year, anxiety about the onset of Obamacare has created a chill in some parts of the economy. While large health care businesses — insurance companies, for instance, and hospital chains — have poured significant resources into preparing for millions of new customers, countless investors have appeared spooked by the perpetual threats to repeal, or at least revise, the law. According to Thomson Reuters, private equity investment, usually the lifeblood for entrepreneurialism, has dropped by an astonishing 65 percent in the health care sector this year.
magazine,Scully has been trying to assuage these worries, but the nervous questions keep coming at him. Before he even began his speech, one attendee said he feared that only three million new patients, far fewer than estimated, would be signing up for insurance. “No way,” Scully said. “Way more — way more. At least 15 million, maybe 20 million. The Democrats have a huge incentive to make this work.” Another asked if Scully was worried about Congressional repeal. “It’s just not going to happen,” he said. “Don’t pay attention to Rush Limbaugh.” When Scully finally began his speech, he noted that the prevailing narrative among Republicans — assuming that many in the room were, like him, Republican — was incorrect. “It’s not a government takeover of medicine,” he told the crowd. “It’s the privatization of health care.” In fact, Obamacare, he said, was largely based on past Republican initiatives. “If you took George H. W. Bush’s health plan and removed the label, you’d think it was Obamacare.” Scully then segued to his main point, one he has been making in similarly handsome dining rooms across the country: No matter what investors thought about Obamacare politically — and surely many there did not think much of it — the law was going to make some people very rich. The Affordable Care Act, he said, wasn’t simply a law that mandated insurance for the uninsured. Instead, it would fundamentally transform the basic business model of medicine. With the right understanding of the industry, private-sector markets and bureaucratic rules, savvy investors could help underwrite innovative companies specifically designed to profit from the law. Billions could flow from Washington to Wall Street, indeed.
magazine,Scully, who has spent the last 30-some years oscillating between government and the private sector, is hoping to be his own best proof of the Obamacare gold mine. As a principal health policy adviser under President George H. W. Bush, he helped formulate many of those past Republican initiatives — like the shift to private-insurance programs — that Obamacare has put into law. Under George W. Bush, he ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and oversaw a host of proto-Obamacare reforms, like Medicare Part D, which introduced competition into the government-supported health care market. After leaving C.M.S. in 2004, Scully began working simultaneously at Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a leading health care private equity firm, and Alston & Bird, a law firm and health care lobbying organization. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, he found himself in the rare position of being a lobbyist, private equity executive and former government health care official with access to a serious amount of capital. During the past three years, as other Republicans have tried to overturn Obamacare, Scully searched for a way to make a killing from it.
magazine,A couple of years ago, Scully identified his best bet. NaviHealth, the company he co-founded, is designed to streamline an enormous but often overlooked corner of the health care market that, many studies conclude, is the most financially wasteful: post-acute care, or the treatment of patients (mostly seniors) after hospitalization for surgery or serious illness. NaviHealth relies on complex analytical software and a vast medical staff (it has about 175 employees) to offer better post-acute care at lower cost. By that September afternoon, Scully and his partners had already raised $35 million to build NaviHealth, which he expected to be profitable in one month. If all went according to plan, NaviHealth would be just the first of many billion-dollar companies built around the Affordable Care Act. Scully could demonstrate for countless other investors how to become their very own Obamacare billionaires. Scully wrapped up his speech on a personal note. As a Republican, he said, he was ambivalent about the Affordable Care Act. He liked the market-driven private-insurance exchanges, but he detested that the law called for hundreds of billions of dollars in future subsidies to help Americans, including certain families earning up to about $95,000, buy insurance. The rapid transfer of so much money from other parts of the economy could have a negative overall effect. “It’s way too much money, way too fast,” Scully said. “But it’s going to be great for you investors.”
magazine,Most of the attention surrounding the Affordable Care Act has focused on a single aspect of the law. Even the House Republicans’ recent effort to dismantle it — and the major computer malfunctions that botched its rollout — have been funneled into a debate about the expansion of insurance coverage. (Before the technological setbacks, the Congressional Budget Office expected up to 16 million people, including Medicaid subscribers, to sign up for insurance by the end of 2014.) In many ways, however, Obamacare is less about health care than it is about economics. Medical costs have outpaced inflation for decades, and they are expected to continue to grow significantly over the coming years. The C.B.O. has indicated that those costs, which are expected to nearly double as a percentage of the overall economy by 2038, are by far the largest contributor to the country’s long-term deficit. “Health reform was not just about covering the uninsured,” Elizabeth Fowler, a former staff member for Senator Max Baucus of Montana and a chief architect of the Affordable Care Act, told me. It was “about this twin goal of access and finding ways to reduce the rate of growth in health spending. Everybody is focused on the coverage angle, but the changes in the law designed to address cost could be a bigger and longer-lasting change.”
magazine,The economic assumption inherent in the law is that the government can cut costs by shifting the incentives of health care providers. The existing system is built around a so-called fee-for-service model, in which doctors, hospitals and other practitioners are paid procedure by procedure. The Affordable Care Act seeks to pivot toward what’s called a value-based model, one in which plans and providers compete on price and quality rather than volume. “Before the Affordable Care Act, hospitals and other providers were paid almost solely based on how much work they did, not on how well they did,” Jonathan Blum, the principal deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told me. Obamacare emphasizes these new incentives by leveraging the extraordinary buying power of Medicare and Medicaid, which together foot the bill for nearly $1 trillion a year in health care costs, to encourage providers and entrepreneurs to come up with new ways to provide better care at lower cost in return for their business. This isn’t an entirely market-based solution — the health care businesspeople often need to persuade government officials to approve their plans — but it’s certainly more market-based than what it hopes to replace.
magazine,A few days after Scully’s speech at the “21” Club, I met him at Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital, near NaviHealth’s headquarters outside Nashville. As we entered the emergency room, Scully began to explain how the old incentive structure worked. Using a young woman we saw talking to a triage nurse as a case study, Scully told me that what appeared to be one hospital was actually a group of independent businesses with their own agendas. That triage nurse worked for the hospital, but once she sent that young woman to an E.R. doctor, she was bringing in the services of a new company. If the situation were serious enough, the patient would be admitted to the hospital, where she might be visited by an attending physician from yet another private group. In other hospitals, she might also incur the charges of an independent radiology firm (a fourth company), a physical therapist (a fifth) and so on. These separate firms bill an insurer — Medicare, Medicaid or a private company — for every service. And this gives them an incentive to provide, well, a whole lot of services. In hospitals throughout the United States, patients undergo redundant procedures, from an interview to an expensive M.R.I., frequently because the various providers use incompatible medical-records systems and have no financial incentive to avoid duplication. Often, in fact, they have reason to avoid coordination altogether. An E.R. doctor and a hospital nurse might be reluctant to discuss streamlining a patient’s care for fear of violating laws designed to prevent referring physicians from getting kickbacks from hospitals.
magazine,The real incentives paradox, however, occurs when patients leave. More than a third of patients who receive surgery or other treatments in a hospital need post-acute care (nurse observation, physical therapy or some other treatment that doesn’t require the full resources of a hospital) after they’re discharged. Many patients, research indicates, recover best at home, where they are surrounded by loved ones and far away from the opportunistic infections and depressing atmosphere that can permeate an institution. Home health care is also the cheapest option, even when accounting for a visiting nurse, physical therapist and rented medical equipment. Yet about 60 percent of Medicare patients are instead sent to nursing homes or rehabilitation hospitals. That’s because most of these patients are senior citizens. Medicare, which picks up a majority of their health bills, encourages hospitals to discharge patients quickly after surgery, but it doesn’t offer financial incentives to choose one form of post-acute care over another. And because discharging a patient to home care requires a lot of extra work — ensuring that the correct equipment will be in the home, training family members and so forth — many doctors choose the easier option. They can simply ask a nurse to send the patient to a rehab facility, and everything is handled in about a minute. Medicare automatically approves payment for 20 days of recuperation in a nursing home, and many facilities simply treat the patient for the full allotment. “Miraculously, everyone is cured on the 21st day,” Scully says.
magazine,NaviHealth was born from the notion that data could be used to break up this expensive feedback loop. In 2011, when the Affordable Care Act was a year old, Scully and various partners at Welsh, Carson attended a retreat at a Hudson Valley hunting lodge to discuss how Obamacare might change the investment landscape. The partners understood that the new law was going to create new winners and losers, and with billions of dollars under investment, they went around the room looking for ideas. During the retreat, Scully grew increasingly animated about the potential for an idea he had come across two decades earlier: better-coordinated post-acute care. Scully proudly points to a line he inserted in the 1992 federal budget identifying improved coordination as a way to save hundreds of millions of dollars in health care costs. But it wasn’t until the passage of the A.C.A. that the incentives were in place. Among other initiatives, the A.C.A. would relax restrictions on collusion between health care providers. He and his colleague Scott Mackesy assumed that several companies would have already pounced on this opportunity, and they set out to develop a list of the top post-hospital care coordinators, choose the best one and invest their firm’s money in that business. By the end of the summer, though, it was clear that no such company existed. So by January 2012, they had founded NaviHealth.
magazine,The company, at first, seems like a medical concierge service. NaviHealth, which works with hospitals (like Saint Thomas) and insurers (like Aetna), dispatches its employees to a patient’s bedside during their recovery to discuss the best post-hospital treatment option. The employee, usually a registered nurse, then asks a series of questions about the patient’s age, medical stats and functional abilities. The data are entered into a software program that Scully calls “the instrument.” Essentially a database of about 750,000 patient outcomes, the instrument determines how those with similar characteristics fared in various post-hospital settings: home health, nursing facility or rehab. It can also offer analytics-based suggestions about the optimal length of post-hospital care. (The patient and the physician make the final decision.) Afterward, a NaviHealth nurse stays in close contact with the patient for two or three months to coordinate the recovery. The company makes money by guaranteeing its client, usually an insurance company or a hospital, at least 2 percent off the average cost of post-hospital care. If NaviHealth saves more money, it shares the savings with that hospital or insurer. If it fails to cut costs by the arranged margin, though, it has to pay the difference. This risk, Scully says, gives the company a strong incentive to provide the best care, not simply the cheapest. The patient is simply an indirect beneficiary.
magazine,As we exited the emergency room, Scully walked me through the math. On average, Medicare’s fee-for-service model pays for about 2,000 days in a post-acute care facility for every 1,000 beneficiaries. By comparison, Kaiser Permanente, a provider of low-cost quality care, averages 600 days per 1,000 clients while achieving better outcomes. It’s possible, in other words, that Medicare is paying for 70 million unnecessary days for all of its approximately 50 million enrollees, wasting tens of billions each year. “Even if we’re pretty lousy at this,” Scully said, “even if we only get that down to 1,500 or 1,200 [days per 1,000 clients], we’re going to save them a lot of money and make a lot for ourselves.” The key is keeping patients healthy. Readmission to hospitals, after all, is the single-most-costly aspect of post-acute care, and a single readmitted NaviHealth patient could wipe out a dozen successful transactions. Ken Botsford, NaviHealth’s chief medical officer, told me about a recent conversation he had with a cardiologist who was skeptical of NaviHealth’s incentives. He asked the cardiologist to imagine an at-risk patient, one with a high likelihood of a stroke or heart attack. Typically, the doctor would see this patient, write a series of prescriptions, offer instructions for him and then not see the patient until there was a crisis. A trip to the emergency room for a heart attack, however, could easily cost $12,000. Seeing the patient every week, Botsford explained, would cost around $3,000 a year and might prevent the costly (and of course, dangerous) heart attack.
magazine,After the hospital visit, we took a short drive to NaviHealth’s headquarters in Brentwood, Tenn., a generic town filled with office parks that is quickly becoming a hub of the health care sector. (The tax incentives in the area are very good.) I wondered aloud why a company like NaviHealth didn’t already exist when there seemed to be such obvious moneymaking opportunities in this corner of the industry. It quickly became clear, however, that this isn’t exactly a business of easy money. When we reached NaviHealth’s office, Clay Richards, its president, showed me around the spartan setup: Ikea furniture, rows of small cubicles, managers in small, windowless offices. Richards, who has an eerie resemblance to a young George W. Bush (“I got that all the time a few years ago,” he says, “but I’m one of the few liberals around here”), explained that the company was rapidly pouring its resources into hiring and training the staff and improving the instrument. (A considerable amount of money had been allotted simply to explaining the instrument to providers and patients.) NaviHealth had already spent the entire $35 million that Scully raised. Now the company was requesting another $15 million from its original investors. And despite Scully’s optimism that NaviHealth would be profitable by October, its revenue had yet to exceed costs. “Someone is going to do this and make a lot of money,” he said, repeating his mantra. “I hope it’s us.”
magazine,Scully has a simple way of describing what NaviHealth — and much of the Affordable Care Act — brings to medicine. “It’s called capitalism,” he told me. “Which doesn’t exist in health care, really.” He’s right — sort of. In a normal market economy, money is the reward that signals success; it flows to whatever business best serves people’s needs and wants. The central idea of capitalism, as Adam Smith declared it, is that people and firms seeking profit for themselves will also, inadvertently, help create better outcomes for society. But this doesn’t always work in health care, an industry in which market forces reward all sorts of perverse outcomes. A healthy person, for instance, is far less “valuable” to the health care industry than one who overeats, smokes, misuses medicine and ends up with diabetes, heart conditions or a host of other ailments that require hospital beds, enrollment in high-cost nursing facilities and expensive interventions. Since at least the 1950s, economists and practitioners have been seeking ways to make health care mimic other efficient markets by financially rewarding those who provide more health, rather than those who treat more ailments. But politicians made a series of short-term fixes that all but guaranteed long-term problems. For example, the seemingly unimportant decision, in 1954, to make health care benefits tax deductible accelerated the proliferation of employer-based health care programs. This, and a few other legal prods, created an ad hoc system with limited access and rapidly rising costs.
magazine,Each president since Lyndon Johnson has proposed alterations, and a result has been an increasingly byzantine and conflicting system of market forces and government control. In 1965, Congress created Medicare, the single-payer health plan for seniors, and Medicaid, a program that benefits those with chronic disabilities and low incomes, among others, and operates differently in each state. Medicare’s fee-for-service model, in which the government pays for a huge number of procedures with minimal cost control, contributed to steadily rising health care costs. Then, the Nixon administration promoted the Health Maintenance Organization in an attempt to more efficiently manage care for patients. Many foresaw a nation of H.M.O.’s competing for customers through better services and cheaper prices, but they didn’t solve the rising costs. By 1990, it was clear that government health care spending, which was rapidly outpacing overall economic growth, presented a looming fiscal crisis. So President George H. W. Bush instructed his staff to come up with a new health care delivery system. His budget director, Richard Darman, gave the assignment to Tom Scully, a telecommunications lawyer who had recently come to the White House. Working with Glenn Hubbard, an economist in the Treasury Department, Scully began to draft a plan rooted in conservative values. He wanted a health care plan that would operate partly as a free market — by funneling most spending through private insurance companies — while allowing the government to coordinate incentives toward maximizing patient health outcomes while lowering cost. But the health care plan was derailed by the first gulf war. Then Bush lost re-election.
magazine,In 2001, after George W. Bush appointed Scully the administrator of what would soon be known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he at last began to implement his ideas. Scully focused on designing and executing Medicare Part D, which opened one corner of government-provided health care — pharmaceuticals — to market forces. This created a new role for a previously relatively obscure business, the pharmacy benefit manager, or P.B.M., which streamlined prescription-drug services. Express Scripts, a once modest Midwestern company, used economies of scale to lead the effort in shifting seniors from expensive name-brand drugs into generics. According to Fortune, it is now the 24th-largest company in America. By the time Medicare Part D went into effect in 2006, Scully, who was by then in the private sector, put his theory to the test. He invested in a smaller P.B.M., MemberHealth, which grew, in three years, from $6 million in revenue to $1.2 billion. “It was a hockey stick,” he recalls. “It took off like a rocket.” When the A.C.A. was near passage, Scully hoped to repeat the success. Once he and his partners at Welsh, Carson realized no one else had seen the potential in post-acute care, he thought he had another MemberHealth on his hands. “That’s what I expected with NaviHealth,” he told me. “I felt the same way: we would take off like a rocket.”
magazine,Partly obscured by the debate about coverage is the fact that the Affordable Care Act has created something called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, a sort of health care innovation incubator that funds companies as they explore new ways of delivering quality care more cheaply. So far, hundreds of existing companies have adapted to take advantage of various A.C.A. incentives; others are newly formed. Some are small (a physician practice in Williamstown, Ky., and another in Junction City, Ore.); others are behemoths. TransforMED, a subsidiary of the American Academy of Family Physicians, for example, is running a pilot program that seeks to coordinate all of a patient’s care in practices across the country. Some markets seem especially competitive — not only large cities like Los Angeles but also Little Rock, Ark., and Tulsa, Okla. There are so many new or redesigned companies, in fact, that it’s clear that many will have to restructure their approach in the competitive market. That could even include NaviHealth. Running a well-capitalized start-up isn’t easy, and Scully’s constant travel often reminded me of George Clooney’s character in “Up in the Air.” He works half the time in New York and the other half in Washington, and he is seemingly always on the road, giving speeches, meeting clients and investors, overseeing the concerns of his company. NaviHealth has persuaded a few large insurers, like Aetna, to run pilots in states from New Jersey to Washington, and the company currently has 1.5 million patients. But the hockey-stick money won’t come until NaviHealth persuades the biggest potential client of them all, Medicare, with its 50 million enrollees, to employ its services broadly.
magazine,Yet that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon. While NaviHealth currently works with the Medicare Advantage program, it still needs to convince the larger organization of its potential. On Jan. 1, the company will begin a three-year demonstration project with hospitals in five cities through C.M.S. So for the next three years, as Medicare monitors the program, NaviHealth’s growth could be marginal, and Scully will remain on the go. His greatest fear, he confessed to me one morning, was that in the meantime some larger, better-capitalized firm would swoop in and turn NaviHealth into the Nokia of the Obama­care business. “The idea is sound,” Scully said. “I know the idea will work. I just don’t know if we’ll be the ones who do it.” Which companies will get very, very rich is hard to predict. Who knew, in 1998, that Google’s algorithmic search would beat out the hand-built version of Yahoo. Or that Amazon’s everything store would win over the countless specialty retailers, like Pets.com. Scully’s NaviHealth is an enormously expensive and high-tech model that will be challenging to scale nationwide, and it already has competitors with entirely different models. RightCare Solutions has gotten a lot of attention for a software program developed by a team of Wharton students, similar to the NaviHealth instrument. But RightCare doesn’t put its own money at risk; it simply offers a software tool and analysis to hospitals and others. It’s easily scalable. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation also lists dozens of hospitals trying post-acute care businesses quite similar to the NaviHealth model. It’s exactly the kind of competition that Elizabeth Fowler, and the Baucus team, intended the law to encourage.
magazine,Whether all this money flowing from Washington to Wall Street will benefit the rest of us is another question. Glenn Hubbard, the pre-eminent economist who helped devise George H. W. Bush’s health plan with Scully, told me that the cost of the A.C.A. will far outpace any possible efficiencies. Dean Baker, an economist at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research, told me that a government-run single-payer plan would be far more beneficial. Sherry Glied, dean of N.Y.U.’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a former senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services under President Obama, said the law won’t “have big effects in either direction.” On the morning that Congress finalized the deal that would reopen the government and defeat — for a few weeks, at least — the latest Republican effort to derail Obamacare, I visited Scully in his New York office. On his wall was a picture of him with Eric Cantor and John Boehner, and so I asked if he wanted to show off his association with some of the least popular politicians in America. “I’m a Republican,” he said. “Maybe a moderate one, but I’m a Republican.” He shook his head. “Boehner is a great guy. I really feel for him. He didn’t want this.” Scully then began a set speech I had heard many times about how Republicans don’t understand the new health care law, that it’s actually more, not less, capitalistic than anything that came before.
magazine,I could tell he was frustrated. He was no longer talking about how it was essential for NaviHealth to make a profit by October. Now, in mid-October, he said he wanted a profit by December. He thought it would already have taken off, but he noted that Obamacare wasn’t fully enacted yet. “We’re early,” he said. “It’s good that we’re early.” Then his voice lowered. “Maybe we’re too early. In five years, there will be a dozen companies like NaviHealth competing in the space. I hope we make it.” That, of course, is another central aspect of capitalism. Not every company does.
us,Fee to Be Charged for Video of South Carolina Shooting, Publicist Says - The New York Times NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. —  The video of a North Charleston police officer shooting an unarmed man in the back will now cost news outlets that want to run it $10,000, according to a publicist representing the man who shot it. Cease-and-desist letters went out this week to news outlets around the world from Markson Sparks, a publicity and celebrity management company based in Sydney, Australia. The video, taken April 4, showed a North Charleston police officer, Michael T. Slager, shooting a man who ran from him after a traffic stop. A bystander, Feidin Santana, took the video and then turned it over to the family of the man who was killed, Walter L. Scott. The officer was charged with murder and remains jailed. The video, viewed more than one million times on YouTube alone, quickly came to represent the excessive use of force by the police. The announcement about the fee seemed to come as a surprise to Mr. Santana. He later recalled that his lawyer mentioned something about charging for it, but said he did not understand. The lawyer, Todd Rutherford, said it was only fair for Mr. Santana to start getting paid for something that news outlets benefited from. “The search for justice is served by turning the video over to law enforcement,” Mr. Rutherford said. The news media, he said, appeared to be in the “search for revenue.”
us,Copyright experts agreed that although news agencies are allowed to use even copyrighted material under what is called “fair use” clauses in the law that time period has passed. “At some point it’s not newsworthy anymore and you are using it for commercial benefit,” said Frederic Haber, a vice president and general counsel of the Copyright Clearance Center, a collective licensing organization that works on behalf of copyright holders such as The New York Times. The issue could change once the video is played in court during a trial, he said. The Times has used the video with the family’s permission and not received a cease and desist letter. Max Markson, chief executive of Markson Sparks, said by phone from Australia: “I think that the people who might be put off by this are the media outlets that had it for free. Now they will have to pay.” He said the fee amount would be negotiable, although another person familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to speak publicly said news media outlets were being charged a one-time fee of $10,000. A lawyer for Mr. Scott’s family said the relatives remain grateful to Mr. Santana and have no problem with him receiving a financial benefit. “Without the video, we would not be where we are right now,” said Justin Bamberg, one of the family’s lawyers.
world/asia,Taliban Suicide Bomb Attack Kills Key Police Official - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — A Taliban suicide bomber on Saturday infiltrated a heavily guarded governor’s compound in northern Afghanistan where top NATO and Afghan officials from the region were meeting, killing several people there, including the highly regarded police commander Gen. Daoud Daoud, Afghan officials said. Two NATO soldiers and the provincial police chief, Shah Jahan Noori, were also killed, NATO officials said. Two senior officials were among the many wounded: the German commander of NATO’s force in the north, Maj. Gen. Markus Kneip, and the governor of Takhar Province, Abdul Jabar Taqwa. The attack occurred about 4:30 p.m. when a man wearing a police uniform blew himself up during the security meeting inside the governor’s offices in Taliqan, the Takhar capital, Afghan officials said. Maryam Kofi, a member of Parliament from Takhar, said the bomber entered the meeting as a security guard for one of the guests. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. “This was a very important security meeting and our goal was to target the meeting and we succeeded,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said by cellphone. A former warlord in his native province of Takhar, General Daoud was admired for his role as a fighter against the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and the Taliban the following decade. As a young man he became a close confidant to the legendary Northern Alliance commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, who died after being attacked by suicide bombers with Al Qaeda two days before the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
world/asia,He was named head of the northern zone police, covering nine northern provinces, about a year ago at a time when security in northern Afghanistan was steadily deteriorating. Now, his death raises concerns about stability in the region as NATO begins turning over security to Afghan forces in July. Abdullah Abdullah, a former presidential candidate, credited General Daoud with helping to shift the momentum in the region. He inspired trust and confidence among his subordinates, “but also among the people,” Mr. Abdullah said, “because you cannot win it with police; you can only win it with your people.” “He was my best friend for 26 years now,” Mr. Abdullah added. “He cannot be replaced.” President Hamid Karzai, who was in Turkmenistan, said in a statement that he was “deeply grieved” by the deaths. “The martyrs of this wild attack were the true sons of this country who have been working tirelessly for the prosperity and honor of this country,” he said. The Afghan president also offered condolences to the German government for the death of its soldiers, and he included General Kneip in his message, apparently in the belief that he had been killed. “This general was a real friend of the Afghan people who lost his life to help the security of the Afghanistan people,” Mr. Karzai said. The attack was the latest in which infiltrators in the Afghan security forces were able to penetrate heavily guarded government compounds and carry out attacks inside.
world/asia,In one example this month, an Afghan Army soldier helped secure a uniform and fake identification for a bomber, who then blew himself up inside the national military hospital in Kabul, killing six people, according to Afghan intelligence officials. In April, a police officer who had recently joined the force entered the tightly secured police headquarters in Kandahar city, killing the police chief, another figure who was widely admired. Dr. Fatima Aziz, a Parliament member from Kunduz Province, which borders Takhar, called Sunday’s attack “a big failure on the part of the government and intelligence” for failing to provide adequate security for the meeting. “It shows their inability in safeguarding the lives of high value targets for the Taliban insurgents,” she said. Taliqan, a normally calm city of 200,000, has been rocked by unrest in recent weeks. On May 18, thousands of protesters assaulted the police headquarters and a nearby NATO base. And 12 people were killed during the first of two days of rioting that broke out in reaction to a coalition night raid that killed four people, including two women. Among the officials who criticized the raid was the provincial police chief, Mr. Noori, who was killed in the attack on Saturday. “These kinds of operations are increasing the gap between the people and the government,” he said at the time. On Saturday, Mr. Karzai ordered his Defense Ministry to take charge of the nighttime raids from the coalition forces. It was his most aggressive attempt yet to stem the use of such operations, which have outraged Afghans but which NATO says are critical in its fight against the Taliban.
world/asia,In a statement, Mr. Karzai said that in an effort “to avoid arbitrary and uncoordinated operations by foreign forces in Afghanistan,” he had instructed his defense minister to bring the night raids under Afghan control. What effect the order will have on NATO operations was not immediately clear. Coalition officials say Afghans already plan and lead many nighttime missions, and are always present in NATO-led operations. NATO defended the operations in a statement on Saturday. “We know we would not have seen the gains and progress made to date without the conduct of targeted, intelligence-driven night operations,” Lt. Cmdr. Kathleen D. Sweetser said. But she added that NATO “fully supports President Karzai’s intent to have Afghan forces increasingly in the lead for operations.”
business/global,E.C.B. Hardens Deadline for Cyprus Bailout Deal - The New York Times NICOSIA, Cyprus — As the European Central Bank threatened to shut off crucial financing for banks in Cyprus without a rapid accord on an international bailout, members of Parliament put off a vote on Thursday on yet another revamped formula. The vote was rescheduled for Friday. The mood in the streets turned increasingly dark. Police officers clashed with protesters as about 200 gathered outside Parliament. Those involved in the scuffles included employees of Cyprus Popular Bank, the country’s second-largest bank, who had turned out amid rumors that it could be shut down within hours. The central bank issued a denial but warned that Cyprus Popular Bank risked an immediate default if Parliament did not pass the bailout measure. After the government said banks would remain closed until Tuesday to allow time for a bailout deal to be reached, residents flocked to cash machines in growing numbers. Lines of three dozen people or more, withdrawing as much money as possible, were common sights. With anger growing, President Nicos Anastasiades presented Parliament on Thursday with a plan that scrapped a controversial tax on bank deposits. Experts warned, however, that the deposit-tax plan might need to be revisited unless the government found other means to reach the goal of 5.8 billion euros, or $7.5 billion, needed to satisfy international negotiators. The central bank said the new package included “consolidation measures” to enable Cyprus Popular Bank, also known as Laiki Bank, to continue operating.
business/global,As the country’s most troubled lender, it would be reorganized by placing underperforming loans and questionable assets into a so-called bad bank and transferring healthy assets to the Bank of Cyprus, the nation’s largest financial institution. By effectively shutting down one of the banks needing support, the government would lower the large tab for supporting the banking system. But the central bank warned that if Parliament failed to pass the measure, “Laiki will default immediately, causing major consequences to its employees and its clients.” Lawmakers will also vote on restrictions on taking cash out of banks and out of the country, known as capital controls, when the banks reopen. The bill would limit cash withdrawals, prohibit or restrict check cashing and bar “premature” account closings and any other transaction that authorities deemed unwarranted. The central bank said on Thursday that Cyprus had until Monday to reach an agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund if the government wanted its banks to continue to receive the low-interest loans essential to keeping them afloat. After a hastily convened evening meeting to assess the situation, the group of 17 finance ministers whose countries use the euro issued a statement declaring themselves “conditionally satisfied” with most of the new proposal, which the so-called troika of lenders — the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission — is to assess on Friday after the Parliament vote.
business/global,“We now need to move into top gear and work intensively with the Cypriot government and our troika partners to design a viable alternative solution that can be acceptable to all euro-area member states,” Simon O’Connor, a spokesman for the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn, said in a statement. The plan sent to Parliament on Thursday would nationalize pension funds from state-run companies and conduct an emergency bond sale to help raise the 5.8 billion euros Cyprus needs to secure a 10 billion euro bailout. Gone was any reference to a deposit tax, which Parliament had roundly rejected in a vote two nights earlier. At branches of Laiki Bank and the Bank of Cyprus in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, where lines had virtually disappeared over the last three days, there was an air of exasperation, anger and anxiety on Thursday as people hoped that money would still be in the machines by the time it was their turn to make a withdrawal. Only one of two cash machines at each bank branch was working. “Time is up — we want our cash,” said Maria Melitou, an accountant. “Our friends in Europe brought us to this point,” she added. “We expected more.” Irena Margilou, the 13th person in an 18-person line at a Laiki Bank cash machine, said bitterly, “We don’t know what the future holds.”
business/global,Ms. Margilou criticized what she said was German insistence that the Cypriot government skim money from people’s bank accounts to secure the bailout. “It’s like you’re telling us to just leave our money in our mattress,” she said. “What is happening to European solidarity?” In Limassol, a coastal city about an hour’s drive southwest of Nicosia that is crowded with Russian residents, lines of 25 to 30 people snaked in front of every A.T.M. that still had cash. Many of the wealthiest citizens of Russia, which is not in the euro currency union, have bank accounts in Cyprus — one reason that euro zone finance ministers have taken such a hard line. In Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin discussed the Cyprus situation on Thursday in a one-on-one meeting with the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, who was in Russia for an annual meeting of senior officials. A delegation of Cypriot officials led by the finance minister, Michalis Sarris, also remained in Moscow to press their case for additional aid, but there were no reports of progress, and the officials stayed out of sight. For months, Cyprus had been discussing the possibility of changing the terms of a loan of 2.5 billion euros that Russia provided in late 2011, to lower the interest rate and defer the repayment deadline. The Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said in a meeting with European journalists that a number of Russian state-owned companies had bank accounts in Cyprus, and he expressed annoyance that those accounts had been frozen, presumably interfering with some business operations.
business/global,Russian citizens and other entities are estimated to have 23 billion euros or more in Cyprus banks. But the Russian government is also concerned about an even larger amount of money that typically flows through Cyprus, where many companies that operate in Russia maintain offshore affiliates. The authorities have ordered Cypriot banks to keep A.T.M.’s filled with cash as long as the banks themselves are closed. But that has been of little help to the thousands of international companies that do banking in Cyprus, which cannot transfer money in and out of those accounts to conduct business. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the euro zone finance ministers, said on Thursday that there were few signs that Russia would come forward with an alternative plan or loans enabling European lenders and the Cypriots to reduce their contribution to a bailout package. He added that Russian loans to Cyprus would only swell the country’s already unmanageable debt, and that this made it inevitable that Cyprus would have to impose a one-time tax on “investors” rather than on “savers.”
us/politics,Obama Proposal Worries Insurers and Regulators - The New York Times President Obama’s effort to quiet a political uproar by suggesting on Thursday that consumers should be allowed to keep their current health plans met significant resistance from many insurers and state regulators, who said they had not been consulted in advance about the proposal, doubted it could work and feared it might seriously damage the new insurance marketplace. After the president announced the proposed changes, insurance regulators participated in a heated conference call, according to one regulator, where many expressed deep unhappiness about the proposal. Some on the call felt “the president kind of threw us under the bus today,” the regulator said on the condition of anonymity because the discussion was supposed to be private. What emerged from the call was a strongly worded statement warning of the possible effects of the president’s proposal. “This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond,” said Jim Donelon, Louisiana’s insurance regulator and the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In Washington State, where the new state-run exchange has been a success, Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner, issued a harsh response, saying he would not do as Mr. Obama had urged and allow the state’s insurers to extend policies into 2014.
us/politics,“I do not believe his proposal is a good deal for the State of Washington,” he said. “In the interest of keeping the consumer protections we have enacted and ensuring that we keep health insurance costs down for all consumers, we are staying the course.” Under the new policy, the White House said insurers would no longer be required under the Affordable Care Act to upgrade existing coverage for people who were now enrolled. People would be allowed to keep their policies even if they did not provide all the benefits and protections required by the 2010 health care law. How insurers would sell these existing policies, and at what prices, will have to be determined by insurance regulators and insurance companies. Many insurers did not ask that rates for existing policies be approved by state regulators because the policies were supposed to be discontinued at the end of the year. “As a pragmatic matter,” said a White House official, “it will be up to insurance commissioners and states.” Insurers and regulators worry that under the new proposal, too many people will continue their old plans. These policies are likely to be less expensive than coverage in the exchanges because the benefits are not as great and they were sold to a generally healthier group. Insurers priced their policies for 2014 based on the assumption that everybody would have to be in the new market, and they and regulators worry that their costs will be much higher if only older and sicker people enroll in the new plans.
us/politics,Health insurers also said the result could be much higher costs — and therefore higher prices for consumers — than expected. “Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,” said Karen Ignagni, the president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group in Washington. In California, another state with a well-functioning marketplace, health plan officials also expressed opposition to the idea. “Reversing course now could cause a significant disruption in the marketplace,” said Patrick Johnston, the chief executive of the California Association of Health Plans. “The entire underlying premise of the A.C.A. — balancing costs of the young, old, sick and healthy — has been left adrift with this announcement.” Amid the outcry, a few regulators expressed some support for the idea while others withheld comment until they had more time to digest it. California’s insurance commissioner, Dave Jones, said he had already forced two companies, Blue Shield of California and Anthem Blue Cross, to delay the cancellation of policies for about 220,000 customers for a few months to allow them more time. His support for the president’s proposal could put him at odds with the officials running the state marketplace who want as many people as possible to enroll in one of the new plans.
us/politics,Insurers also expressed concern about the cost of reinstating policies that had already been purged from their computers and that had not been included in negotiations with doctors and hospitals. Carl McDonald, an analyst with Citigroup, said the president’s plan created an “enormous administrative burden” for insurers and predicted many would choose not to extend coverage. “The complexity of trying to uncancel millions of canceled individual policies with only six weeks left in the year is staggering,” he wrote in a report. Insurers who are new to the market could be particularly hurt by the proposal, with many people choosing to stay with their existing plans because they are less expensive rather than shop on the exchange. Consumer-operated plans, called co-ops, were set up to compete with existing insurers and must rely solely on attracting new customers. Some insurers, like Aetna, seemed more supportive of the proposal as a way of relieving the anxiety of customers who panicked when they received letters informing them that their policies were being canceled. Others agreed. “We had a lot of customers who are confused and concerned,” said Patrick J. Geraghty, the chief executive of Florida Blue, who said state officials there had already committed to working with insurers to develop a way for individuals to continue their coverage. “It was the right thing to do,” he said.
sports/basketball,LeBron James Is Bloodied, but Thunder Are Beaten - The New York Times OKLAHOMA CITY —  LeBron James scored 33 points before leaving in the fourth quarter with a bloody nose, and the Miami Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, 103-81, on Thursday night. James went down with 5 minutes 50 seconds remaining after he was struck by Oklahoma City’s Serge Ibaka on a drive to the basket. James finished a dunk but left the court with a towel over his face. Dwyane Wade had 24 points and 10 assists, and Chris Bosh added 24 points for Miami, which won its fourth straight and avenged an earlier loss to Oklahoma City. Kevin Durant scored 28 points to lead the Thunder. Russell Westbrook, who had missed the previous 27 games after having surgery on his right knee, started and scored 16 points. Oklahoma City lost at home for the first time since Jan. 5. The Thunder overcame an early 18-point deficit on Jan. 29 to roll past the Heat, 112-95, in Miami, and the home fans on Thursday hoped for a regular-season sweep against the Heat, which beat Oklahoma City in the 2012 N.B.A. finals. The crowd erupted as Westbrook was introduced as a starter. His first minute of action lifted the fans to their feet. His first basket was a two-handed, fast-break dunk 37 seconds into the game, and he got a steal 17 seconds later.
sports/basketball,The excitement quickly evaporated, though. James scored 10 points on 5-for-5 shooting in the first 3:11, and Miami made 13 of its first 14 shots to take a 28-13 lead. James scored 16 points to help the Heat lead by 34-17 at the end of the first quarter. The Thunder rallied before halftime, but Miami took control in the third quarter and had a 76-65 lead entering the fourth. PACERS MAKE BIGGEST MOVE AT DEADLINE The Indiana Pacers decided Evan Turner gave them a better shot against the Heat than Danny Granger did. Many other teams decided there was not much worth doing. Big names and big deals were mostly absent before the N.B.A.’s trade deadline Thursday, with the Pacers’ swap with the Philadelphia 76ers late in the day being the one that could have the biggest impact on the playoff race. Indiana sent Granger and a second-round draft pick to Philadelphia in exchange for Turner and Lavoy Allen. It gives the Pacers a potential upgrade in Turner, a former No. 2 overall pick whose average of 17.4 points a game is about twice that of Granger, who is working his way back from a series of injuries. “We felt we needed to make this trade to strengthen the core unit and our bench,” Larry Bird, the Pacers’ president of basketball operations, said in a statement.
sports/basketball,Kevin Love, Pau Gasol and Rajon Rondo had been mentioned in trade rumors for weeks, but Love received attention Thursday only when he denied that he had already told Flip Saunders, the Minnesota Timberwolves’ president, that he would not stay once he became a free agent after next season. “At the end of the day, I just want to play basketball,” Love said. “I don’t want to think about, you know, whether or not I’m going to be here or somewhere else in 2015-2016, whenever it is.” The Denver Nuggets addressed their point-guard problem by sending Andre Miller to the Washington Wizards and acquiring Aaron Brooks from the Houston Rockets. The Wizards parted with two seldom-used players, forward Jan Vesely and point guard Eric Maynor. Vesely went to Denver while Maynor went to Philadelphia, which also received second-round picks from the Nuggets and the Wizards. Vesely and Brooks, who was acquired in exchange for shooting guard Jordan Hamilton, were expected to join the Nuggets for their game at Chicago on Friday night. The Atlanta Hawks, looking for more front-line help as they try to remain in the Eastern Conference playoff race, acquired the 37-year-old forward Antawn Jamison from the Los Angeles Clippers. The Clippers received the rights to shooting guard Cenk Akyol, a 2005 second-round pick now playing in Turkey, in the deal. NUGGETS 101, BUCKS 90 Kenneth Faried continued his recent hot streak, scoring 26 points to carry Denver past host Milwaukee.
sports/basketball,Faried scored a career-high 28 against the Clippers on Feb. 3 and was coming off a 21-point performance against Phoenix.
world/europe,Saying He’s Pro-Russia, McCain Criticizes Putin - The New York Times MOSCOW —  In a combative essay published Thursday in the online newspaper Pravda.ru, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, declared himself to be “pro-Russian” but delivered a blistering attack on President Vladimir V. Putin, describing him as presiding over a failed petro-state and as a quasi dictator who rules “by corruption, repression and violence.” Mr. McCain’s article was intended to answer an Op-Ed column by Mr. Putin in The New York Times on Sept. 12 that made the case against President Obama’s threatened military strike on Syria. Mr. Putin’s column, in which he presented Russia’s position as defending international law and respect for state sovereignty, generated fierce debate, including praise and accusations of hypocrisy. While Mr. Putin’s article focused more generally on American foreign policy, Mr. McCain, who has long been a sharp critic of the Kremlin, focused squarely on the Russian president himself. In his introduction, though, Mr. McCain made an effort to dispel the idea that he is anti-Russian, a perception that is widespread here. “I am not anti-Russian,” Mr. McCain wrote. “I am pro-Russian, more pro-Russian than the regime that misrules you today.” “I make that claim because I respect your dignity and your right to self-determination,” he continued, addressing the Russian people. “You should be governed by a rule of law that is clear, consistently and impartially enforced and just. I make that claim because I believe the Russian people, no less than Americans, are endowed by our creator with inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he added.
world/europe,While Mr. McCain wrote that he did not believe a Russian citizen could publish similar criticism, such complaints appear frequently in the Russian press — especially online, where there is generally no censorship even as the government retains fairly strong control over what is shown on the major television stations, particularly in news reports. Mr. Putin, speaking Thursday at an annual conference of Western academics and policy analysts, ridiculed Mr. McCain for submitting the article to Pravda, which he suggested was proof that the American senator was locked in an outdated cold war mind-set. “I think that he has a certain deficit of information about our country,” Mr. Putin said. “And the fact that he wanted to be published in Pravda, not any other publication, apparently he wants to be published in a most authoritative publication with big circulation,” Mr. Putin added, mockingly. “Of course, Pravda is a respectable publication of the now oppositional Communist Party, but its level of distribution in the country is minimal.” Mr. Putin insisted that there was nothing anti-American in his article in The Times, and he said Mr. McCain had been invited to the conference, called the Valdai Discussion Club after the Russian town where it is held. Mr. Putin usually holds a private dinner with the Valdai group, but to note the event’s 10th anniversary, the invitation list was broadened to include several opposition politicians and journalists who were given limited access.
world/europe,Mr. Putin used his remarks and a question-and-answer session to touch on a wide range of subjects, and he portrayed the event itself as proof that there was no suppression of speech in Russia. At one point, Mr. Putin defended a new Russian law banning propaganda on nontraditional sexual relations, which is widely perceived as intended to suppress homosexuality. He said that the law did not discriminate, but also that “Europeans are dying out” in part because of societal acceptance of gay relationships. Even as he suggested that Mr. McCain was stuck in the past, Mr. Putin raised his own complaint with a cold war edge. “Once, we were promised that NATO will not cross the eastern border” of Germany, he said. “We discussed it and Gorbachev was given a promise, though it was not registered anywhere. And now, where is NATO? And where is the border? We were simply duped.” Mr. McCain cited the propaganda law in his article, criticizing Mr. Putin’s government. “They write laws to codify bigotry against people whose sexual orientation they condemn,” he wrote. He did not defend United States policies, but accused Mr. Putin of shielding the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “How has he strengthened Russia’s international stature?” Mr. McCain asked. “By allying Russia with some of the world’s most offensive and threatening tyrannies.” Mr. McCain was not the first member of Congress to respond to Mr. Putin in the Russian news media.
world/europe,On Monday, Kommersant, one of Russia’s most prominent daily newspapers, printed an open letter to the Russian people by Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In his letter, which he also published on his Web site, Mr. Israel explained in leveled language why he would potentially vote in favor of a military strike on Syria, although he praised Mr. Putin’s efforts to persuade Mr. Assad’s government to surrender its chemical weapons arsenal. “Diplomacy should always be the first preference,” Mr. Israel wrote.
world/europe,Russia and Estonia Differ Over Detention  - The New York Times MOSCOW —  A strange incident near the Russian-Estonian border on Friday ended with an Estonian intelligence officer in Russian custody and the two countries trading sharply contradictory allegations about what happened. Estonia’s president and prime minister, among other officials, said the officer had been kidnapped at gunpoint from their territory and forced across the border in a blatant violation of sovereignty. The Russian Federal Security Service said the officer was in Russia and engaged in a clandestine operation when he was detained. The episode threatened to heighten tensions between Russia and the NATO alliance, to which Estonia belongs, at a time when relations are already severely strained over the conflict in Ukraine. It came just two days after President Obama gave a speech in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, pledging that NATO would defend the Baltics against Russian aggression and suggesting that any attack on them would lead to war with the West. Although the intelligence officer was apparently detained around 9 a.m., the Russian security service, known as the F.S.B., did not acknowledge the incident until Friday evening, when it issued a statement to three Russian news agencies. Senior Estonian officials, including the director of the country’s Internal Security Service, held a news conference in the late afternoon, saying the officer had been abducted after unknown assailants set off a stun grenade and jammed communication signals. At the time of his capture, the officer was investigating a criminal case in the area of Luhamaa, Estonia, a little more than a mile from the border with Russia, officials said, according to Estonian news reports.
world/europe,The officials said they met with Russian border guards, but the guards professed no knowledge of the matter. This is hardly the first time the Russian government has been accused of kidnapping across international borders. In 2012, Leonid Razvozzhayev, a Russian political opposition leader who fled to Ukraine and contacted United Nations officials in Kiev in hopes of applying for political asylum, was forced into a van outside his lawyer’s office and reappeared under arrest in Moscow. The Russian authorities said he had surrendered. And this summer, the Ukrainian government accused Russia of abducting Nadiia Savchenko, a Ukrainian helicopter navigator, who was apparently detained by separatists in eastern Ukraine and resurfaced in prison in the Russian city of Voronezh. Russian officials said she had crossed the border posing as a refugee. Russia, in turn, has accused the United States of engaging in similar behavior, most recently in the case of an accused computer hacker, Roman Seleznev, who was arrested in Guam. Russia has also accused the United States of illegal arresting and convicting a  reputed global arms trafficker, Viktor Bout. Urmas Paet, the Estonian foreign minister, called the apparent abduction of the intelligence officer “very disturbing” and summoned the Russian ambassador to discuss the situation. President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Prime Minister Taavi Roivas each issued a statement denouncing the incident and demanding Russian assistance in investigating it. Calling it “unacceptable and deplorable,” Mr. Ilves said that those responsible had “invaded the territory of Estonia.”
world/europe,In the F.S.B. statement, the security agency identified the Estonian intelligence officer as Eston Kohver, of the Tartu division of the Internal Security Service, a part of the Interior Ministry. The statement said that Mr. Kohver “has been detained on Russian territory” and that he was found to be carrying a Taurus pistol and ammunition cartridges, 5,000 euros (about $6,500), surveillance equipment and “intelligence-gathering instructions.” “Kohver is detained, and the necessary investigative steps are being carried out,” the agency said. Estonia shares a border of roughly 180 miles with Russia, much of it in the middle of Lake Peipus. The border crossing near Luhamaa is in the extreme southeast corner of Estonia, on a main highway between Pskov, Russia, and Riga, Latvia, that passes through Estonian territory. Many Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, harbor a grudge over the membership of the three Baltic countries in NATO, saying that the alliance broke a promise to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, that it would not extend its membership farther east than Germany. In his speech in the Estonian capital on Wednesday, Mr. Obama voiced firm commitment to protecting the Baltic nations, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. “The defense of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defense of Berlin and Paris and London,” Mr. Obama said, referring to the Baltic capitals. “An attack on one is an attack on all.”
world/europe,Noting that the Soviets invaded and occupied the three states without foreign interference in 1939, he said, “If, in such a moment, you ever ask again, ‘Who’ll come to help?’ you’ll know the answer: the NATO alliance, including the armed forces of the United States of America.” He added: “You lost your independence once before. With NATO, you will never lose it again.” On the Russian side of the border, foreigners must obtain a special permit to visit the area nearest to Estonia. Last year, Russian security officials briefly stopped three journalists with The New York Times who had gone there to meet with the mother of Dima Yakovlev, a toddler who died in Texas in 2008 a few months after he was adopted from Russia by an American family. Asked by one of the journalists why the area was restricted, a security officer pointed at Estonian territory across Lake Peipus. “This is your NATO,” he said.
world/europe,Ukraine Faces E.U.’s Dismay on Turnabout on Accords - The New York Times VILNIUS, Lithuania —  Undoubtedly, it was an uncomfortable moment. President Viktor F. Yanukovich of Ukraine, who last week ditched plans to sign far-reaching political and trade agreements with the European Union, found himself confronted Thursday night by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and by the host of a summit meeting here, President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania. Ms. Merkel, holding a glass of white wine, stood in front of Mr. Yanukovich, a beefy man who is at least a head taller. “We see you here,” said Ms. Merkel, nodding her head and giving a disapproving shrug. “But we expected more.” Next to her, Ms. Grybauskaite nodded in assent. Mr. Yanukovich had nowhere to turn. The scene, captured on a video released by Ms. Grybauskaite’s office, summed up the European Union’s Eastern Partnership conference here — an event that officials once had hoped would mark a giant westward step by Ukraine toward European integration. Instead, leaders had to settle for preliminary agreements with Moldova and Georgia, and were left grappling with how best to deal with a challenge from Russia, which pressed Ukraine to drop the accords. Mr. Yanukovich, who has called for new negotiations with Russia and the European Union, had little to say. “The economic situation in Ukraine is very hard,” he is heard saying on the video. “And we have big difficulties with Moscow.”
world/europe,Ukraine, a nation of 46 million people that borders four European Union countries — Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania — faces an increasingly grave economic crisis and is in desperate need of a financial aid package. Officials here said that Mr. Yanukovich had repeated his request for assistance in a meeting on Thursday with the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, and the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, and asked them for help in persuading the International Monetary Fund to soften the terms of a large loan deal that has been under negotiation for months. The request suggested that Mr. Yanukovich had received no guarantee of economic aid from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, despite several face-to-face meetings in recent weeks. The Kremlin had maneuvered forcefully to block Ukraine from signing the accords, and its success in doing so was the latest in a string of recent foreign policy victories for Russia. Some European leaders are calling for additional aid to Ukraine in the hopes of cajoling Mr. Yanukovich into signing the agreements next year, but it was not clear that the I.M.F. would be willing to ease its requirements, which include a number of painful austerity steps, such as increasing public utility rates. While officials expressed excitement over the steady progress of Moldova and Georgia, and their initialing of preliminary agreements that keep them on track toward European integration, the disappointment over Ukraine was palpable. There was less visible regret over a similar decision by Armenia in September, also made under pressure from Russia, to give up its plans for signing agreements with Europe.
world/europe,“With Ukraine, look, we are very, very clear that we want to have a strong relationship with Ukraine,” Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said, with a note of exasperation in her voice, as she arrived for talks at the summit meeting on Friday morning. She added, “The European Union’s door is open.” The initialing of preliminary agreements with Georgia and Moldova brings those countries to a point that Ukraine reached in March 2012, raising the possibility of further efforts by Russia to prevent the accords from ultimately being signed. Moldova had already come under substantial pressure from Moscow, including a ban on Moldovan wine, one of the country’s most important exports, and threats of an immigration crackdown that could expel more than 100,000 Moldovan citizens living and working in Russia. Several officials said the West had been caught flat-footed as Russia maneuvered effectively to derail the accords, and a number of Eastern European leaders lamented a lack of involvement by the United States. In a sign that Washington had started to pay attention, the State Department announced this week that Secretary of State John Kerry would visit Moldova on Tuesday. Prime Minister Iurie Leanca of Moldova said his country welcomed the attention. Like other leaders here, he noted that the United States had seemed uninterested in the recent developments in Eastern Europe. “I don’t want to hide that we were badly disappointed in the last four years that the Americans were not as active as they were in the 1990s,” he said.
world/europe,Georgia, which fought a brief war with Russia in 2008, has been less vulnerable to pressure from Moscow, in part because its relations with the Kremlin have been bad since then. At a news conference, the Georgian president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, said he hoped there would be no strong-arming. “We try to deliver the message to all capitals that a prosperous, democratic Georgia is only a benefit for all neighbors, including Russia,” he said. President Grybauskaite said Friday morning that she believed Mr. Yanukovich had made a mistake. “I think today’s Ukrainian leadership chose a way which is going nowhere,” she said. In Ukraine, protests that began after Mr. Yanukovich’s government announced its decision last week continued Friday. In some cases, particularly in the capital, Kiev, they turned violent. There were reports of police officers and journalists being beaten, and allegations that thugs had been paid to incite unrest. Before dawn on Saturday, riot police officers broke up a demonstration with clubs and tear gas, The Associated Press reported. Many supporters of European integration in Ukraine had been hoping for a last-minute surprise, thinking that perhaps Mr. Yanukovich was simply seeking to increase his leverage. That could mean either seeking more favorable loan terms or avoiding some preconditions set by Europe, including the release of his political rival, the jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Before the conference ended on Friday, the European Union and several of the former Soviet republics signed a number of other smaller agreements, including a plan to work on easing visa requirements with Azerbaijan.
world/asia,Afghan Girl Was Tricked Into Carrying Bomb, Officials Say - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — Insurgents tricked an 8-year-old girl in a remote area of central Afghanistan into carrying a bomb wrapped in cloth that they detonated remotely when she was close to a police vehicle, the Afghan authorities said Sunday. Only the girl was killed in the blast, which occurred Sunday morning in the village of Uwshi in the Char Chino District, said Fazal Ahmad Shirzad, the police chief of Oruzgan Province. Mr. Shirzad said he believed the girl was unaware that the bag she had been given by Taliban insurgents held a bomb. Her body was “taken to a nearby security check post, and the police called her relatives,” he said. Meanwhile, in Logar Province in southeastern Afghanistan, the death toll rose to 37 after a bombing on Saturday at a small-town hospital, said Dr. Mohammad Zaref Nayebkhail, the director of public health for the province. He said that at least 53 people had been wounded. But, he said, the actual number of casualties was probably much higher. “Local villagers rushed to the hospital right after the explosion and took the bodies of their relatives to their own villages,” he said. In other parts of the country, four NATO soldiers were killed. Two of them were Spanish soldiers who died when an improvised explosive device detonated in Badghis Province in western Afghanistan, the Spanish Defense Ministry said. The other two soldiers died in separate episodes in southern and eastern Afghanistan, according to a NATO statement.
world/asia,Afghan radio stations also reported that rocket fire from Pakistan over the last week had led President Hamid Karzai to register a former complaint with the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, at a regional terrorism meeting in Iran on Saturday. Mr. Zardari promised to investigate, said Mr. Karzai’s spokesman, Waheed Omar. The unexplained rocket fire will be a topic of discussion when senior government figures from the two countries meet this week, Mr. Omar said. The Afghan National Security Council discussed the matter on Sunday. According to Mr. Omar, President Zardari and the Pakistani Interior Ministry said the rockets, which hit Kunar and Nangarhar Provinces, were not fired by the Pakistani Army. Mr. Omar said 470 rockets had been fired, killing at least 18 people and wounding 17. Since Pakistan’s tribal areas border eastern Afghanistan and are largely outside the Pakistani government’s control, it is possible that insurgent groups are responsible. But some Pakistani insurgents have set up bases in Kunar and Nuristan Provinces in Afghanistan to carry out attacks in Pakistan, raising the possibility that the rockets may have been fired by the Pakistani security forces. “We want this resolved peacefully,” Mr. Omar said. He added that if the Pakistani government was not responsible, it should say so publicly and find and stop the attackers. General Mohammed Zahir Azimi said that Afghan military forces were “ready to retaliate” if instructed to do so. A NATO spokesman said coalition officials were not aware of the rocket fire because they did not have troops in the areas where it occurred.
us/politics,Behind the Roar of Political Debates, Whispers of Race Persist - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  President Obama last week sought to turn attention from health care to immigration — in other words, from one racially divisive issue to another. Whites tend to hold negative views of Obamacare, while blacks tend to like it. Specifically, 55 percent of whites, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found this year, consider Mr. Obama’s health care law a bad idea, while 59 percent of blacks call it a good idea. On immigration, 51 percent of whites oppose legal status for illegal residents, but 63 percent of blacks and 76 percent of Hispanics favor it. The statistics mirror the core philosophical division in Washington’s fierce battles over taxes, spending and debt. Whites say government does too much, while blacks and Hispanics say it should do more to meet people’s needs. Those attitudes, and the continued growth of the nonwhite population, have produced this sometimes-overlooked result: American politics has grown increasingly polarized by race, as well as by party and ideology. That reality promises to command more attention as the day draws closer when whites will no longer make up a majority of the population, which the Census Bureau projects will be in 2043. Race receded from public dialogue in the mid-1990s for reasons that served both parties. Republicans grew fearful of criticism of the racially charged tactics that began with Richard M. Nixon’s “Southern strategy.” And a Democratic president — Bill Clinton — and a Republican Congress overhauled welfare, draining racial electricity from partisan combat. By 2008, Mr. Obama sought to dial back talk of race in his campaign to become America’s first black president.
us/politics,Now two factors have combined to raise the racial volume. First, the growing voting strength and allegiance of black, Hispanic and Asian-Americans have made nonwhites an increasing share of the Democratic coalition. Second, conservative whites are bitterly resisting both Mr. Obama and his agenda. Thus a crucial variable before last November’s election was the racial composition of the electorate. As the Obama team predicted, the proportion of white voters fell to 72 percent. The president won by drawing eight in 10 black, Hispanic and Asian-American votes, even as Mitt Romney won six in 10 white votes. Electoral geography punctuated those disparities with historical resonance. In the 11 states of the Confederacy, Mr. Romney outpolled Mr. Obama by nine percentage points. Elsewhere, Mr. Obama won by 10 points. Against that backdrop, Congressional Republicans have pursued cuts in food stamp spending, and Republican-controlled state legislatures have enacted voter-identification laws. A Republican official in North Carolina recently resigned after telling a “Daily Show” interviewer that ID cards could diminish voting by “a bunch of lazy blacks that wants the government to give them everything.” Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote his 2011 book, “The Tea Party Goes to Washington,” with a former radio host known as the Southern Avenger who wore a mask decorated with the Confederate flag. This summer, the co-author left his job as the senator’s social media director after news reports emerged about that earlier work.
us/politics,Stanley Greenberg, a pollster for Mr. Clinton and other Democrats, said that recent focus groups among core Republican voters highlighted anxiety that “big government is meant to create rights and dependency and electoral support from mostly minorities who will reward the Democratic Party with their votes.” “While few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, the base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities,” Mr. Greenberg wrote. “The base thinks they are losing politically and losing control of the country.” One risk for Democrats is reacting to those cultural fears with stridency, as Representative Alan Grayson of Florida did recently in likening the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan, drawing a rebuke from the Democratic Party’s national chairwoman. Some Republicans strike similar chords. In Kentucky, an ally of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, hit Mr. McConnell’s Tea Party-backed primary challenger for having once supported a third-party presidential candidate “found on YouTube giving a lengthy speech in front of the third national flag of the Confederate States of America.” Fred Steeper, a Republican pollster who advised both Presidents Bush, worries about renewed attention to racial divisions for two reasons. One is that it could taint what he calls the Republican Party’s “legitimate argument” in favor of self-reliance and smaller government. The other is the difficulty of winning national elections if the party’s hard-line on immigration continues to alienate Hispanics. “Racism may be a part of it,” especially among working-class whites, Mr. Steeper said of the immigration stance. “The Republican Party needs to stop pandering to that.”
us/politics,He added, “The Republican Party needs to throw in the towel on the immigration issue.” The Democrats’ problem is winning over whites. At the moment that’s a challenge of governance — as Mr. Obama’s struggle to implement his health law demonstrates. “The challenge we have with the health care law is similar to the challenge we’ve had in our politics more broadly,” Mr. Obama said in a recent interview. “There have been caricatures of what we’re trying to do.” Most uninsured Americans who will be helped by the law, he added, “are going to be white.” The risk for the country is heightened racial tensions. Mr. Obama’s advisers play down that prospect for the long term, noting younger Americans’ instinct for tolerance. “As rising generations replace older ones,” a study by the liberal Center for American Progress concluded last week, “concerns about rising diversity will recede.” In the meantime, Mr. Steeper hopes Republicans can persuade more Hispanics, Asian-Americans and blacks to align with their message of opportunity. “We should have two parties based on a different approach to the role of government,” he said. “I don’t want our parties to be representing racial groups.”
us/politics,House Approves Bill That Allows Policy Renewals - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  Defying a veto threat from President Obama, the House approved legislation on Friday that would allow insurance companies to renew individual health insurance policies and sell similar ones to new customers next year even if the coverage does not provide all the benefits and consumer protections required by the new health care law. The vote was 261 to 157, with 39 Democrats bucking their party leadership and the White House to vote in favor of the bill. Hours after the vote, Mr. Obama and top aides met for over an hour with insurance executives  after industry leaders complained Thursday that they had been blindsided by a White House reversal on canceled policies. The president described the meeting as a “brainstorming” session about how to ensure changes to the health care law go smoothly. The insurance representatives, from more than a dozen companies, said they would work with the administration to protect the financial viability of the new marketplaces, but did not say how. Afterward, Karen Ignagni, the president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said it was a “very productive” meeting, but would not go into detail. The legislation approved by the House would go further than the fix announced on Thursday by Mr. Obama, who said he would temporarily waive some requirements of the law and allow insurers to renew “current policies for current enrollees” for a year.
us/politics,Many of the Democrats who supported the bill are facing tough re-election fights back home, and expressed deep frustration with how the administration had handled the early carrying out of Mr. Obama’s signature health care law. Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia, who voted for the legislation, said that the White House deserved an “F-minus” for its botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act. “I’m disgusted about it,” Mr. Rahall said. “I think heads should roll downtown. Whoever was responsible or may have known that this was going to occur should no longer be employed.” Representative Ron Barber, Democrat of Arizona, who also joined Republicans in voting for the bill, was equally scathing, calling the rollout “a disaster.” “My constituents are pretty upset,” he said, “and so am I.” Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chief sponsor of the House bill, said it would fulfill a promise that Mr. Obama had made to the American people and then broken. “In the last three years,” Mr. Upton said, “the president personally promised that if people liked their current health care plan, they could keep it ‘no matter what.’ But cancellation notices are now arriving in millions of mailboxes across the country. It’s cancellation today, sticker shock tomorrow.” Mr. Upton, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, belittled Mr. Obama’s proposal, saying it was offered at the last minute, “as the administration’s allies in Congress panicked.” Senior Democrats criticized the Upton legislation as a ploy that could unravel the entire health care law.
us/politics,“Don’t pretend you care about the American people’s health care here,” said Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania. “You just want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats are not going to let you do that.” And Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, said insurers, in discussing the bill, had had “significant concerns on how it would work operationally.” The outlook for the legislation is unclear in the Senate, where Democrats running for re-election in 2014 are looking for a way to help consumers facing the loss of insurance policies that do not meet requirements of the 2010 law. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, was one of the first Democrats to break with the White House and offer her own proposal, which would allow people to keep their current plans indefinitely. However, after the president’s turnabout on Thursday, many Senate Democrats said they were waiting to see if additional legislation was necessary, and quick action in the Senate is not expected. House Democrats on Friday used a procedural maneuver to offer a plan of their own called “Landrieu lite.” It was similar to the president’s proposal in its approach, and it gave Democrats some political cover in that it showed them taking action on the issue.  The Democratic proposal, which was rejected by Republicans, would have allowed people who like their current plans to retain them for a year. Under the Democratic proposal, unlike with Mr. Upton’s bill, insurers would not be allowed to sell plans that previously faced cancellation to new customers.
us/politics,Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, said insurers should be allowed to sell new policies like those now in force because it was extremely difficult for consumers to obtain coverage through the federal website, HealthCare.gov. But Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Upton’s bill was an attempt to “drag us back to the bad old days of the American health care system.” It would, he said, allow insurers to sell “cut-rate shoddy policies that lack the consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act.” The House vote came as Mr. Obama struggles to extricate himself from a political crisis of his own making. Opinion polls indicate that he is losing the trust of many Americans because of his handling of the health law rollout and the debut of the insurance website, which has been paralyzed by technological failures. Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said the Upton bill would provide relief to some people hurt by the president’s health care overhaul. “The American people have grown weary of this administration spending money that it does not have on programs the American people do not want,” she said. “The president’s health care law is a great example.” The White House said Mr. Obama would veto the House bill if it got to him. The bill, the administration said, would reverse progress made in extending coverage to the uninsured.
us/politics,The House bill says that if an insurer was providing coverage in the individual market on Jan. 1 of this year, it “may continue” to offer such coverage for sale next year in the market outside the new insurance exchanges. People who choose to buy or renew these policies in 2014 would be deemed to be in compliance with the requirement to have insurance, so they would not be subject to tax penalties for violating the individual mandate. Insurance executives say that the premiums in the new federal and state marketplaces were based on the assumption that younger and generally healthy people who had been enrolled in cheaper plans would move into the new marketplaces. Their presence would help keep prices lower for everyone. If those healthier people stick with their current plans, insurers say, then the new marketplaces could be filled with older, sicker people, and premiums could rise.
us,Health Site Infighting Detailed in Emails - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  Senior federal officials involved in building the HealthCare.gov website were deeply concerned this summer about delays as well as weaknesses in the quality and size of the contractor teams assigned to parts of the project, emails released by congressional investigators on Friday show. The emails offer some of the first detailed evidence of which federal government officials had at least some knowledge that the start-up of the health care exchange might be troubled. Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the agency overseeing the project, warned seven other officials in July that the lead contractor, CGI Federal, had better accelerate the work. “I just need to feel more confident they are not going to crash the plane at takeoff,” he wrote on July 16 to colleagues at the agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Chao’s general concerns about the pace of the project were known; he told industry executives at a conference in March that he was worried, remarking, “Let’s just make sure it’s not a third world experience.” But the email exchanges released on Friday make clear that there was growing friction between the federal government and CGI, a Canadian company, as the project missed various deadlines even as the Oct. 1 start-up of the federal marketplace site was approaching.
us,There apparently was also tension between two contractors: CGI, which was leading the effort, and QSSI, a Maryland company that was supposed to test the computer programs to ensure that they worked. A spokeswoman for CGI declined to comment. But two company employees involved in the effort, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said the problem was not CGI’s work, but a lack of clear federal oversight, as bureaucrats argued over which tasks should take precedent.  “This is internal infighting and reflects the lack of a strong, single manager at C.M.S. to drive the program,” one employee said. The problems were particularly acute with a part of the project that was supposed to help manage the processing of insurance payments. “The FM build appears to be way off track and getting worse,” a federal official, Jeff Grant, wrote in an email on July 8, referring to the Financial Management project. Up to that point, the email added, “they have never revealed the seriously substandard level of staffing that this team has.” Mr. Grant went on to write, “We believe that our entire build is in jeopardy.” A statement from the Department of Health and Human Services on Friday said that these kinds of questions and concerns were common in any large government effort, and that agency officials had publicly acknowledged problems with contractors.
us,The statement also noted that the Financial Management tool, which most of the emails focused on, is just a small piece of the overall system and that, ultimately, Human Services decided to keep it offline because it was deemed nonessential. But Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which released the 11 pages of emails on Friday, said the messages showed that the Obama administration was not truthful with Congress earlier this year. “Administration officials looked us in the eye and told us everything was ‘on track,’ ” Mr. Upton said. “But when we pull back the curtain now, the mess is disturbing.” The emails themselves hint that even with the problems evident as of mid-July, the officials hoped to meet the deadline. On July 20, Mr. Chao sent a note to more than two dozen federal officials that shared testimony that he and his boss, Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, had given to Congress that month in which they promised that the HealthCare.gov site would be ready for the October launch. “Marilyn and I under oath stated that we are going to make Oct. 1,” he wrote. Jeffrey D. Zients, whom President Obama appointed to repair the website, said Friday that the online system was significantly improved. He cited faster response times, low error rates and more users over the past week.
us,Outside Judge Is Named for Police Shooting Case - The New York Times NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. —  In a departure from the way most cases are handled, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of South Carolina on Tuesday appointed a judge from outside North Charleston to oversee the case against the former police officer, Michael T. Slager, who has been charged with murder in the shooting of Walter L. Scott, an unarmed man who fled after being pulled over for a traffic stop on April 4. Chief Justice Jean Hoefer Toal ordered Judge Clifton B. Newman of South Carolina Circuit Court on Tuesday to preside over all legal matters in the case and to retain jurisdiction “regardless of where he may be assigned to hold court.” Judge Newman, a former prosecutor based in Kingstree, about 75 miles north of Charleston, is one of only five African-American Circuit Court judges in the state. A clerk for the Supreme Court said in a statement that “when a matter is complex or is otherwise in need of management from beginning to end by one judge, the chief justice routinely issues an administrative order making such an assignment.” Trial judges typically rotate in the state, making it rare for a single judge to preside over the duration of a case. Charleston County’s chief prosecutor, Scarlett A. Wilson, seemed to be taken aback by the move, saying in a statement that she was “unaware this was in the works.” Mr. Slager’s lawyer, Andy Savage, welcomed the order. “Judge Newman enjoys an excellent reputation as a jurist, and we look forward to working under his guidance,” Mr. Savage said in a statement, calling it a “long-overdue decision.”
us,Pete Strom, a former United States attorney in South Carolina, said the order reflected a desire to assure both law enforcement and African-Americans that an experienced hand would be steering the case. “This is important for all of us that our system look right,” he said. Also on Wednesday, a State Senate subcommittee passed a bill requiring all law enforcement officers in the state to wear body cameras. The new developments played out after the passenger in Mr. Scott’s car, through his lawyer, made his first comments on the case. The passenger, Pierre Fulton, reported that he heard the crackle of a Taser and a series of gunshots but did not see the encounter, his lawyer, Mark Peper, said Wednesday morning. Mr. Peper said that Mr. Fulton did not know why Mr. Scott ran from his car after Mr. Slager pulled them over for a broken taillight. Mr. Fulton sat calmly in the car after losing sight of Mr. Scott because he had no reason to think his friend was in danger, Mr. Peper said. “The best explanation for that is because they weren’t doing anything wrong, and there is nothing to indicate this is anything but a routine traffic stop,” Mr. Peper said. Mr. Scott picked Mr. Fulton up at his home on the morning of April 4 before the two went to Hardee’s for breakfast, Mr. Peper said. Then they drove to Faith Assembly Church, where they each got a bag of food from a food bank. They dropped off Mr. Fulton’s bag at his home and were continuing to Mr. Scott’s house, where they planned to have a cookout that afternoon.
us,Mr. Peper said neither man was impaired in any way when Mr. Slager pulled them over. “Pierre was just sitting there thinking, ‘He’ll just give us a ticket,’ ” Mr. Peper said. “Then all of a sudden, Walter bolts.” On Friday, in a meeting with officials from the South Carolina law enforcement division, Mr. Fulton gave no indication that he had heard signs of a scuffle between Mr. Scott and Mr. Slager before the shooting, Mr. Peper said, though investigators did not ask Mr. Fulton specifically about that. Mr. Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle that Mr. Scott had taken his Taser. On Thursday, members of Black Lives Matter Charleston plan to present a list of 10 proposed changes to members of the North Charleston City Council. Kwadjo Campbell, a former Charleston city councilman who is working with the group, said the changes would include “calling for a police chief that is more sensitive to community needs” and strengthening independent oversight of the police department.
arts/music,Andy Williams, Crooner of ‘Moon River,’ Dies at 84 - The New York Times Andy Williams, the affable, boyishly handsome crooner who defined both easy listening and wholesome, easygoing charm for many American pop music fans in the 1960s, most notably with his signature song, “Moon River,” died on Tuesday night at his home in Branson, Mo. He was 84. The cause was complications of cancer, his publicist, Paul Shefrin, said. Mr. Williams, who had continued to perform until last year, announced in November that he had bladder cancer. “Moon River” was written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer, and Audrey Hepburn introduced it in the 1961 film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” but it was Mr. Williams who made the song indisputably his own when he sang it at the 1962 Academy Awards ceremony and titled a subsequent album after it. When he built a theater in Branson, he named it the Andy Williams Moon River Theater. “Moon River” became the theme song for his musical-variety television series “The Andy Williams Show,” which, along with his family-oriented Christmas TV specials, made him a household name. “The Andy Williams Show” ran on NBC from 1962 to 1971 and won three Emmy Awards for outstanding variety series. But its run also coincided with the social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s, and with a lineup of well-scrubbed acts like the Osmond Brothers (whom Mr. Williams introduced to national television) and established performers like Judy Garland and Bobby Darin, the show, at least to many members of a younger, more rebellious generation, was hopelessly square — the sort of entertainment their parents would watch.
arts/music,Despite that image, “The Andy Williams Show” was not oblivious to the cultural moment. Its guests also included rising rock acts like Elton John and the Mamas and the Papas, and its offbeat comedy skits, featuring characters like the relentless Cookie Bear and the Walking Suitcase, predated similar absurdism on David Letterman’s and Conan O’Brien’s talk shows by decades. Mr. Williams’s Christmas specials, on the other hand, were entirely anodyne and decidedly homey, featuring carols and crew-neck sweaters, sleigh bells and fake snow, and a stage filled with family members, including his wife, the telegenic French chanteuse Claudine Longet, and their three children. The Osmonds were regular guests, as were his older brothers, Bob, Don and Dick, who with Mr. Williams had formed the Williams Brothers, the singing act in which he got his start in show business. Although Mr. Williams’s fame came from television, movie themes were among his best-known recordings, including those from “Love Story,”“Charade,”“The Way We Were” and “Days of Wine and Roses.” Decades after he had stopped recording regularly, his old hits continued to turn up on movie soundtracks: “The Most Wonderful Time of the Year” in “Bad Santa,” for instance, and his version of “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” in “Bridget Jones’s Diary.” Mr. Williams earned 18 gold and 3 platinum albums and was nominated for Grammy Awards five times, but he never had a gold single. (His version of “Moon River” was not released as a single, although versions by Mr. Mancini and Jerry Butler reached the Top 20.) His biggest hit single — and his only No. 1 — was “Butterfly,” an uncharacteristically rocklike 1957 number for which he was instructed to imitate Elvis Presley.
arts/music,His more mellow hits included “Canadian Sunset,” “The Hawaiian Wedding Song,” “Lonely Street,” “Can’t Get Used to Losing You,” “The Shadow of Your Smile” and “Are You Sincere?” He continued to record into the 1970s. Mr. Williams was close friends with Senator Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, and sang “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at Kennedy’s funeral in 1968, but he considered himself a Republican. By 2009 he had become an outspoken one. “Obama is following Marxist theory,” he told The Radio Times, a British magazine. “He’s taken over the banks and the car industry. He wants the country to fail.” For 21 years, until 1988, Mr. Williams was the host of a namesake golf tournament in San Diego. He also collected art — works by Picasso, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Henry Moore — and in 1987 was named to Arts & Antiques magazine’s list of 100 top American collectors. Howard Andrew Williams was born on Dec. 3, 1927, in Wall Lake, Iowa, a small town northwest of Des Moines. His father, Jay, a railroad company mail clerk who later went into the real estate and insurance businesses, and his mother, the former Florence Finley, had one daughter and five sons, Andy being the fourth. He and his older brothers began singing in their local Presbyterian church’s choir, which their father directed. When Andy was 6, the four formed the Williams Brothers singing group and were soon appearing on the radio stations WHO in Des Moines, WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati.
arts/music,After the family moved to Los Angeles, Andy was asked to dub Lauren Bacall’s singing voice in the 1944 film “To Have and Have Not.” According to several sources, including Ms. Bacall, the studio ended up using her voice after all, although perhaps a few high notes were the boy’s. That same year Bing Crosby invited the Williams Brothers to sing backup on his recording of the hit song “Swinging on a Star.” After World War II ended, the brothers toured with the singer, actress and author Kay Thompson for five years. Then the group disbanded, and the three older brothers left show business. At 24 Mr. Williams moved to New York, where he was hired for a two-week engagement on NBC’s new, live late-night show, “Tonight,” hosted by Steve Allen. As Mr. Williams often told interviewers, when the two weeks ended, he simply kept showing up at the studio and kept being paid. Both his recording career and his television fame grew from there, leading to contracts with Cadence and Columbia Records and appearances on summer-replacement series. He did so well on television that he was soon given his own year-round prime-time spot. Mr. Williams began performing in Las Vegas in 1966, as a headliner at the opening of Caesars Palace, and continued to do shows there for two decades. His one film role was in a comedy, “I’d Rather Be Rich” (1964), with Sandra Dee and Robert Goulet, and his one appearance on Broadway was in a two-man, limited-run production with the pianist and composer Michel Legrand at the Uris Theater in 1974.
arts/music,On a 1991 visit to Branson, the small Ozark Mountains town that had become an entertainment vacation destination, Mr. Williams decided to build a theater there. When the 2,000-seat Andy Williams Moon River Theater opened the next year, it was Branson’s first non-country-music attraction. He performed there several months a year until last November. He also had a home in La Quinta, Calif. Mr. Williams had a sudden burst of international fame in 1999, when British automobile commercials began using his 1960s hit “Music to Watch Girls By.” The song was rereleased and climbed the British charts. In 2006 he released his first new album in about 15 years, “I Don’t Remember Ever Growing Up,” which included a cover of the Police’s “Every Breath You Take.” He toured Asia that year and Britain in 2007. Mr. Williams married Ms. Longet in 1961, and they had two sons, Christian and Robert, and a daughter, Noelle. The couple divorced in 1975. The next year Ms. Longet was charged with fatally shooting Spider Sabich, a ski racing champion, in Aspen, Colo. Mr. Williams stood by his ex-wife, who contended that the shooting was accidental, and accompanied her to court during her trial. She was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, and sentenced to 30 days in jail. In 1991 Mr. Williams married Debbie Haas, a hotel executive. She survives him, as do his children, his brothers Don and Dick, and six grandchildren.
arts/music,In 2000, Mr. Williams spoke about the passing years to Larry King on CNN. “I think everybody feels, ‘Where did it go?’ because it goes fast,” he said. “But I have done a lot of things that I love.” During his 2007 tour in Britain he attributed his longevity to the joy of performing. He told a reporter there, “Perhaps that two hours out onstage is the medicine that everybody should have.”
us,Arctic Drill Rig Sparks Outcry - The New York Times SEATTLE —  Foes of Royal Dutch Shell’s use of a seaport terminal to prepare for exploratory oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean attacked on two fronts Monday as a few hundred protesters blocked port entrances and the City of Seattle declared that Shell and its maritime host lacked a proper permit. The city said the use of Terminal 5 by a floating drill rig violated the site’s permitted use as a cargo terminal. The 400-foot Polar Pioneer and its support tug Aiviq must be removed from the terminal or Shell’s host, Foss Maritime, must obtain an appropriate permit, the Seattle Department of Planning and Development said. The companies can appeal. Possible fines start at $150 per day. The notice said the violation must be corrected by June 4. A Shell spokesman said it believed the use of the terminal is valid. Foss and the Port of Seattle are appealing an earlier determination by the city that the use of Terminal 5 was not permitted.

nyregion,New York State to Investigate Radioactive Groundwater at Indian Point - The New York Times New York State will investigate high levels of radioactive contamination found in the groundwater at the Indian Point nuclear plant, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday. The governor said water contaminated with tritium had leaked into the groundwater at the plant, causing “alarming levels” of radioactivity to be found at three out of the 40 monitoring wells on the site. One of the wells reported a 65,000 percent increase in the water’s level of radioactivity, Mr. Cuomo said, citing a report by Entergy Corporation, which owns the plant. Mr. Cuomo said the contamination appeared to be limited to the groundwater beneath the plant in Buchanan, N.Y., about 30 miles north of New York City in Westchester County. He nevertheless expressed his alarm, adding, “This latest failure at Indian Point is unacceptable.” “The facility reports that the contamination has not migrated offsite and as such does not pose an immediate threat to public health,” the governor said in a statement. “Our first concern is for the health and safety of the residents close to the facility and ensuring the groundwater leak does not pose a threat.” In a statement, Entergy said the elevated tritium levels are “not in accordance with our standards” but that the amount of radioactivity found at Indian Point remained more than a thousand times below federally permissible limits.
nyregion,“The tritium did not affect any source of drinking water onsite or offsite,” the company said. It called the presence of tritium in groundwater “a well-studied issue” and that the state had found previous instances of contamination to have no ill effect on public health and safety. Nevertheless, the governor sent a letter on Saturday to Basil Seggos, the acting commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, and to Howard Zucker, commissioner of the State Health Department, instructing them to “fully investigate.” The priority, Mr. Cuomo said, was to determine the extent and duration of the radioactive contamination, what caused it and whether it might affect the environment and public health of nearby communities. “We need to identify whether this incident could have been avoided by exercising reasonable care,” he wrote.
business/media,Jerry Seinfeld Takes ‘Comedians in Cars’ to Netflix - The New York Times Jerry Seinfeld is moving to Netflix. New and old episodes of Mr. Seinfeld’s show “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” will move to Netflix later this year. The move is a blow to Crackle, Sony’s streaming service, which has run the show since its debut in 2012. In addition to “Comedians in Cars,” Mr. Seinfeld has also signed a production deal with Netflix, which will include performing two stand-up specials, and developing scripted and nonscripted content. In recent months, Netflix has been gobbling up comic talent, including Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Amy Schumer, all of whom are performing stand-up specials for the service. Netflix has been spending lavishly to bring them on: Mr. Rock’s two forthcoming stand-up shows cost Netflix a reported $40 million. Terms for Mr. Seinfeld’s deal were not disclosed. “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” started on Crackle four and half years ago, and is the highest-profile offering on the service. Last year, it was nominated for an Emmy for best variety series. But Mr. Seinfeld grew distant from Crackle after Sony’s television chairman, Steve Mosko, left the company last year, and “Comedians in Cars” has been on the market since at least October. Hulu was also involved in negotiations for the show. In a statement, Mr. Seinfeld said, “When I first started thinking about ‘Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,’ the entire Netflix business model consisted of mailing out DVDs in envelopes. I love that we are now joining together, both at very different points.”

sports/ncaabasketball,Wisconsin, the Giant Killer, Takes Down Another by Beating Villanova - The New York Times BUFFALO — The most famous buzzer-beater of last year’s N.C.A.A. tournament was, of course, Kris Jenkins’s in the final game, handing Villanova the championship over North Carolina. But some might remember a round-of-32 game in St. Louis last year in which Wisconsin, seeded seventh, overtook second-seeded Xavier with a last-second 3-pointer from the corner by guard Bronson Koenig. Wisconsin went on to lose in the round of 16, but it added that Xavier team to its collection of significant upset victims, which the Badgers’ senior class, led by Koenig and Nigel Hayes, has mounted like deer heads on a wall. Among the others are Arizona in 2014, a top seed that fell to Wisconsin in the round of 8, and the top overall seed of 2015, Kentucky, which the Badgers toppled in the national semifinals. Another top overall seed — nicknamed the Wildcats, like Kentucky and, for that matter, Arizona — has now joined that list. On Saturday, the eighth-seeded Badgers beat the No. 1 seed, Villanova, 65-62, in the second round to end the latter’s hopes of repeating as the national champion. Villanova (32-4) had retained Jenkins as well as Josh Hart, a contender for player of the year, from last season’s championship roster and had won the Big East season and tournament. The Wildcats also had several younger players who had developed into top talents (including arguably their two best players Saturday). Yet they became the sixth team seeded at the top of a region to lose in the round of 32 since 2010.
sports/ncaabasketball,Wisconsin (27-9) will play in the round of 16 on Friday at Madison Square Garden against fourth-seeded Florida, which crushed fifth-seeded Virginia, 65-39, on Saturday night. While Wisconsin led at the half, 31-27, the Wildcats had forced eight turnovers from a team that had averaged fewer than 11 per game. It was unsurprising when Villanova took the lead early in the second half and slowly built on it. Donte DiVincenzo, a redshirt freshman, finished with 15 points, 6 rebounds and 3 steals. Hart, in his final game at Villanova, led with 19 points, and Jalen Brunson, the sophomore point guard, displayed a preternatural sense of where he was, using his body and left-handedness for crafty drives and finishes, scoring 11. “DiVincenzo was hitting some stuff, and we were like, What do you do with that? You can’t do anything,” said Wisconsin’s Jordan Hill, a redshirt junior. Just after DiVincenzo hit a long 2-pointer and a 3-pointer on successive possessions, to give Villanova a 57-50 lead with 5 minutes 31 seconds left, Wisconsin’s comeback began. “From 57-50, the game really got shortened,” Villanova Coach Jay Wright said, referring to possessions extended by offensive rebounding and milking the shot clock — a strategy that defined Badgers basketball after Bo Ryan took over as coach in 2001, and has continued to do so in the season and a half since he retired and turned the program over to his acolyte, Greg Gard.
sports/ncaabasketball,Hayes and Koenig each scored, while Hayes and the sophomore big man Ethan Happ contributed blocks on the other end, to make it 57-54. When Hayes drove and kicked the ball out to Koenig in the right corner and Koenig nailed a 3-pointer, the score was tied, 57-57, with 3:28 to go. Hart made a free throw for Villanova. Happ responded with a short field goal to make it 59-58. After another Villanova free throw tied the game, 59-59, Koenig hit a 3-pointer — his third of the night, to go with the eight he had in Thursday’s win over ninth-seeded Virginia Tech — to give Wisconsin a 62-59 lead. Brunson replied with a quick layup to narrow the lead to 62-61, and DiVincenzo tied the score at 62-62 with a free throw. After a timeout, Happ set a pick to free Hayes, who received the ball at the top right side of the 3-point line. He drove his defender, the sophomore Mikal Bridges, to the baseline, faked a spin away from the basket and then drove back along the baseline, making a reverse layup to give Wisconsin a 64-62 lead with 12 seconds left. A steal credited to the senior Vitto Brown on a drive by Hart sealed it. After the game, Hayes said he had been inspired by a Michael Jordan move. “I remembered there’s a Michael Jordan clip where he drives baseline and does a fake spinback and comes back — he dunked on someone,” Hayes said. “I didn’t dunk on someone, because I’m not Michael Jordan. But I was able to — by that fake, a little hesitation — come back around.”
sports/ncaabasketball,Hayes, who has scored 150 points in N.C.A.A. tournaments to be No. 1 among active players, led Wisconsin with 19 points and 8 rebounds. His favorite current N.B.A. player is Carmelo Anthony, he said Friday, and like Anthony, he repeatedly set up in the midpost in isolation, often either scoring or kicking to a shooter. Happ, who played just six minutes in the first half because of foul trouble, finished with 12 points, 8 rebounds, 2 blocks and 2 steals. He may be inclined to use his two more years of eligibility — the wall could always use extra trophies.
sports/hockey,Ed Snider, Flyers Owner Who Made Philadelphia a Hockey Town, Dies at 83 - The New York Times Ed Snider, who co-founded the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League and owned the team for nearly 50 years, and who was chairman of a sports management company that provided services to hundreds of arenas, stadiums and convention centers in North America, died on Monday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 83. His family said he had died of cancer. The son of a grocery store owner, Mr. Snider formed the Flyers with several partners as an expansion franchise in 1967 in a city with no hockey tradition, no base of hockey fans and no hockey arena. They built one on Broad Street, called it the Spectrum and installed their team. After a shaky start, the Flyers turned the City of Brotherly Love into a town that loved bare-knuckle fights on the ice. Mr. Snider hired a cadre of roughneck fighters after seeing his team of aging retreads and young castoffs humiliated by brawlers like the St. Louis Blues and the Montreal Canadiens. Blood flowed. Sellout crowds roared. In 1973, The Philadelphia Bulletin dubbed the Flyers the “Broad Street Bullies.” And in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers won consecutive Stanley Cup championships. Philadelphia became a hockey town and never looked back.
sports/hockey,The Flyers were the league’s first expansion team to win hockey’s holy grail, and repeating the feat a year later left fans ecstatic. Bursting with pride, two million people turned out for back-to-back celebratory parades. Mr. Snider’s Flyers won no more Stanley Cups, but the team became one of the best in the N.H.L., making the playoffs 38 times and playing in six more Stanley Cup finals, the last in 2010. “Ed basically created hockey in Philadelphia,” Peter Luukko, the Flyers’ president, told The New York Times in 2011. “Luukko was talking about his boss, but just about everybody in Philadelphia says the same thing,” Jeff Z. Klein, a Times hockey reporter, wrote. “Tantalizing as the prospect may sound to Rangers fans — and Penguins fans and Devils fans and Islanders fans and on and on — without Snider there would probably have been no Flyers, no legacy of the Broad Street Bullies, no hockey.” In 1974, Mr. Snider formed Spectacor as a holding company for the Flyers and the Spectrum, with himself as chairman. The company became landlord to the National Basketball Association’s Philadelphia 76ers, who also played at the Spectrum, and acquired Prism, the first regional sports network on cable television, and WIP-AM, one of the first all-sports radio stations. Mr. Snider also wrote innovative contracts to manage arenas in New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Virginia and Florida.
sports/hockey,In the late 1980s, Mr. Snider and Spectacor built an arena in South Philadelphia that became the Wells Fargo Center. In 1996, he sold a majority stake in Spectacor to Comcast but retained a one-third interest and the chairmanship of the merged sports and entertainment behemoth, Comcast Spectacor. The company bought the 76ers and acquired companies that managed and provided food, ticketing and other services for hundreds of arenas, stadiums and convention centers in the United States and Canada. It sold the 76ers in 2011. Mr. Snider attended nearly all the Flyers’ home games and was involved in day-to-day team matters. “The owner is supposed to be the guy with the money, who sits back in some big office and smokes hand-rolled cigars while he watches the bread roll in,” Maury Z. Levy wrote in Philadelphia magazine in 1971. “He is not supposed to get his custom-made suits spoiled by the smell of the locker room after a good game. These are the unwritten rules of being an owner, and Ed Snider breaks every one of them.” Edward Malcolm Snider was born in Washington on Jan. 6, 1933, to Sol and Lillian Bonas Snider. His father owned three grocery stores in the nation’s capital. Ed graduated from Calvin Coolidge High School in 1951 and from the University of Maryland in 1955 with an accounting degree.
sports/hockey,He was named a vice president for business affairs of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League in 1964, after his sister, Phyllis, married Earl Foreman, a part owner of the team. In 1966, when the N.H.L. disclosed plans to expand its league from six to 12 teams, Mr. Snider and several partners, including Jerry Wolman, a principal owner of the Eagles, applied for a franchise in Philadelphia. The city had little experience with pro hockey. The Arrows of the Canadian-American League, a forebear of the American Hockey League, had played there in 1927-28 and in 1934-35. The Quakers, an N.H.L. franchise, played for a season in 1930-31, but quit after a dreadful campaign. While Hockey News said Philadelphia was “least likely to succeed,” the N.H.L. awarded the Snider-Wolman group a conditional franchise. In a division agreed upon by the partners, Mr. Wolman largely financed and controlled the Spectrum, which was built in little more than a year, and Mr. Snider assumed control of the Flyers, who began their inaugural season in October 1967. But Mr. Wolman ran into financial problems, the Spectrum fell into bankruptcy, and Mr. Snider, under a court-approved plan, agreed to pay the creditors and assumed control of the Spectrum in 1971. Mr. Snider, who also had a home in Gladwyne, Pa., was the longest-tenured owner in the N.H.L. when he died.
sports/hockey,He was married four times. With his first wife, the former Myrna Gordon, he had four children, Craig, Jay, Lindy and Tina. They were divorced in 1981. In 1983, he married Martha McGeary. They had two children, Sarena and Samuel, and were divorced in 2001. His 2004 marriage to Christine Decroix ended in divorce in 2012. In 2013, he married Lin Spivak. She survives him, as do his children, 15 grandchildren and a sister, Phyllis Foreman. In 1999, a Philadelphia Daily News poll named Mr. Snider the city’s greatest sports mover and shaker, surpassing the legendary Athletics manager Connie Mack and the basketball broadcaster Sonny Hill. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988 and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2005, he created the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, which maintains ice rinks and provides equipment, coaching and hockey programs for thousands of children in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. He also endowed a research center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
nyregion,Sandy Hook Forces Re-examination of Tough Questions - The New York Times On Friday, as Newtown, Conn., joined the list of places like Littleton, Colo., and Jonesboro, Ark., where schools became the scenes of stunning violence, the questions were familiar: Why does it happen? What can be done to stop it? The questions have emerged after all of the mass killings in recent decades — at a Virginia college campus, a Colorado movie theater, a Wisconsin temple — but they took on an added sting when the victims included children. The fact that the Newtown massacre, with 26 killed at the school, along with the gunman, was the second deadliest school shooting in the country’s history — after the 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007 — once again made this process of examination urgent national business as details emerged from Sandy Hook Elementary School. This painful corner of modern American history does offer some answers: Many of the mass killers had histories of mental illness, with warning signs missed by the people who knew them and their sometimes clear signs of psychological deterioration left unaddressed by the country’s mental health system. The shootings almost always renew the debate about access to guns, and spur examination of security practices and missed warning signals in what were damaged lives. Research on mass school killings shows that they are exceedingly rare. Amanda B. Nickerson, director of a center that studies school violence and abuse prevention at the University at Buffalo, said studies made clear that American schools were quite safe and that children were more likely to be killed outside of school.
nyregion,But, she said, events like the Sandy Hook killings trigger fundamental fears. “When something like this happens,” she said, “everybody says it’s an epidemic, and that’s just not true.” Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, may have earned singular infamy with the killing of 12 other students and a teacher from Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, but there have been others who breached the safety of American schoolhouses over the decades. In 1927, a school board official in Bath, Mich., killed 44 people, including students and teachers, when he blew up the town’s school. Even before Columbine in the late 1990s, school shootings seemed to be a national scourge, with killings in places like Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore. In 2006, a 32-year-old man shot 11 girls at an Amish school in Nickel Mines, Pa., killing 5 of them. Often in a haze of illness, the schoolhouse gunmen are usually aware of the taboo they are breaking by targeting children, said Dewey G. Cornell, a clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia and director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project. “They know it’s a tremendous statement that shocks people,” Dr. Cornell said, “and that is a reflection of their tremendous pain and their drive to communicate that pain.” After 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., in 1997, it came out that he had made no secret of his plans. “He told me, once or twice, that he thought it would be cool to walk — or run — down the halls shooting people,” a friend from the school band testified later. Five Heath students were wounded; three were killed.
nyregion,But some experts on school violence said Friday that it was not so much the character of the relatively rare schoolhouse gunman as it was the public perception of the shootings that transformed them into national and even international events. Dunblane, Scotland, is remembered for the day in 1996 when a 43-year-old man stormed a gym class of 5- and 6-year-olds, killing 16 children and a teacher. Over the years there have been some indications of what warning signs to look for. The New York Times published an analysis in 2000 of what was known about 102 people who had committed 100 rampage killings at schools, job sites and public places like malls. Most had left a road map of red flags, plotting their attacks and accumulating weapons. In the 100 rampage killings reviewed, 54 of the killers had talked explicitly of when and where they would act, and against whom. In 34 of the cases, worried friends or family members had desperately sought help in advance, only to be rebuffed by the police, school officials or mental health workers. After the deaths in Sandy Hook on Friday, there was new talk of the need to be vigilant. But there has also been talk of the sober reality that it is hard to turn the ordinary places of life into fortresses.
nyregion,Dr. Irwin Redlener, who is the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and has worked on school violence issues, said there were steps that could be taken to try to limit school violence, like limiting entry, developing an explicit disaster plan that includes strategies to lock down schools and pursuing close ties with the local police. “Unfortunately,” he said, “random acts of severe violence like this are not possible to entirely prevent.”
arts/dance,Review: Ashwini Ramaswamy Goes Solo at the Drive East Festival - The New York Times Dancers are like anyone else: Sometimes they get the urge to leave the nest. Ashwini Ramaswamy, a soloist with the much-admired Ragamala Dance Company, struck out on her own on Tuesday night at Drive East, the excellent festival of Indian music and dance playing through Sunday at the Ellen Stewart Theater at La MaMa.  Ragamala, based in Minneapolis, is led by the artistic directors Ranee and Aparna Ramaswamy and specializes in the classical style of Bharatanatyam. (Ranee is Ashwini Ramaswamy’s mother; Aparna is her sister.) For this performance, Ms. Ramaswamy opened with “Shankara Sri Giri,” a dance honoring the Shiva Nataraja, the creator and destroyer of the universe, as choreographed by Alarmél Valli. This solo of sacred movement wove together, both fearfully and joyfully, the human and the divine as expressed through the body of Ms. Ramaswamy.  Despite her gleaming beauty, Ms. Ramaswamy presents herself with a forthright simplicity, imbuing her refined, sculptural muscularity with a tranquillity that contrasts with the springy exuberance of her feet. Whether emphasizing thrusting heels or balancing in a sacred pose with one leg raised and bent forward, she neither rushes nor remains frozen: Within each articulation is the sense that there is breath — or a continual flow of energy — coursing through her limbs.  In “Varnam,” the dancer longs to be united with Lord Vishnu. Before this exploration of love got underway, Ranee Ramaswamy, the work’s choreographer as well as a player in the four-member orchestra, explained that it was “a metaphor for the ecstasy that one feels for the divine.”
arts/dance,A half-smile brought an impish candor to Ashwini Ramaswamy’s face and dancing eyes, while her light jumps and tilting torso pulled her from one diagonal to the other. She had been heroic before; now she exuded the darting ebullience of a butterfly.  As she pined for Vishnu, opening her fingers like blossoms, Ms. Ramaswamy embodied a youthful restlessness that took on even more speed and valor in the finale, “Thillana,” choreographed  by Ms. Valli. But the all-woman orchestra also gave this program luster. Along with Ranee Ramaswamy on nattuvangam, or cymbals, the musical accompaniment included the lush singing of Roopa Mahadevan and robust violin playing by Anjna Swaminathan. Rajna Swaminathan, her sister , on mridangam, kept the beat. In classical Indian dance, such girl power is a rare and welcome sight. 
movies,SCREEN: 'DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN' - The New York Times SUSAN SEIDELMAN, you should remember, is the young director who first came to attention three years ago with ''Smithereens,'' a wonderfully funny, independently financed, $80,000 first-feature about a pushy, punkish young woman named Wren and her adventures in the Day-Glo lower-depths of the East Village and blocks west. It's now apparent that ''Smithereens'' was not a fluke. With ''Desperately Seeking Susan,'' her second feature, which opens today at Loews Paramount and other theaters, Miss Seidelman successfully takes the long, potentially dangerous leap from the ranks of the promising independents to mainstream American movie-making, her integrity, her talent and her comic idiosyncracies intact. ''Desperately Seeking Susan,'' based on a good screenplay by a new writer named Leora Barish, is a terrifically genial New York City farce in which the lives of two very different young women become tangled in an Orlon web of lies, half-truths and crosspurposes. It's a fable that involves, among other unlikely things and people, a pair of stolen earrings that once belonged to Nefertiti; a gangster slain in Atlantic City; an earnest, uptight businessman who sells Jacuzzis and hot tubs, and who stars in his own cheery television commercials; a professional hit man; amnesia and mistaken identity; a soberly commonplace magician, and a handsome young fellow who makes his living as the projectionist at a theater specializing in the B-pictures of yesteryear.
movies,The film's two charming, very funny stars are Rosanna Arquette, the blond chamelion most recently seen in John Sayles's ''Baby, It's You'' and in the television adaptation of Norman Mailer's ''The Executioner's Song,'' and Madonna, one of the hottest personalities in music videos, who here has her first major role in a theatrical film and carries it off with nervy ease, as if to echo the Jerry Lieber-Mike Stoller lament, ''Is That All There Is?'' Miss Arquette's Roberta is a pampered, Fort Lee, N.J., princess, married to Gary, the Jacuzzi salesman and TV ''star.'' Like Ibsen's Nora, magically transported to a condo- with-pool on the far side of the George Washington Bridge, Roberta gets fed up and leaves home, though, unlike Nora, she really doesn't mean to bang the door behind her. What lures the romantically inclined Roberta away from her probably fake fireplace is a series of personal ads she has been following for some months, each headed ''Desperately Seeking Susan,'' followed by a message from ''Jim,'' who sets up the time and place for their next rendezvous. On impulse one afternoon, Roberta decides to spy on one such rendezvous in Battery Park, where, after a series of unfortunate misunderstandings and a bop on the head, she finds herself with no memory of who she is, though everybody seems to think she's Susan.
movies,Madonna plays the real Susan, a slightly more focused variation on the eccentric, free-living heroine of Miss Seidelman's ''Smithereens,'' which is not to say that Susan is more conventional, only that the film surrounding her is. Susan is one of society's most winning bandits, but her crimes are essentially victimless. She has no pad of her own and sleeps around for convenience as much as for pleasure. Dressed in her miniskirts, rhinestone boots, and enough New Wave junk jewelry to start her own thrift shop, Susan looks like a piece of performance art on the hoof. Through a succession of perfectly implausible coincidences - this is, after all, a farce - Roberta, the protected princess from Fort Lee, starts living a reasonable facsimile of Susan's wayward life. She is housed, against his better judgment, by Dez (Aidan Quinn), the projectionist, who is the best friend of Susan's main man Jim (Robert Joy), and works as the on-stage assistant to the world's most optimistic, second-rate magician (Peter Maloney) in a Village club that would attract only the seediest of conventioneers. Susan, aware that the mob might be after her for reasons she never worries about, eventually connects with Roberta's husband, Gary (Mark Blum), and Gary's sister, Leslie (Laurie Metcalf), who, her imagination expanded by expose magazines, suspects that Roberta may be either a housewife-prostitute or a housewife- lesbian, and maybe both. Gary, dazzled by Susan's manners and glittery raiment, takes her back to Fort Lee, which seems as exotic to her as the Village is to Roberta.
movies,It's no easy thing to keep this kind of farce spinning with seeming effortlessness and, toward the end, ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' becomes a little desperate itself. Miss Seidelman and Miss Barish never find that single, explosively funny, climactic confrontation scene in which all of the characters would converge for sudden recognition. The movie ends sweetly, but sort of piecemeal. Miss Seidelman's principal talent is for bringing cockeyed characters to life with great good humor and no condescension, and she's as wicked about life in the new bohemia as in the new suburbia. ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' is full of funny, sharply observed details, reflected in Santo Loquasto's witty production design as well as in all of the dozens of individual performances. The cast is virtually a Players Guide to the variety of performing talent available in New York. Miss Arquette and Madonna are delights, as is each member of the huge supporting cast, from Mr. Quinn, Mr. Blum, Mr. Joy and Miss Metcalf, through Mr. Maloney and down to those people who appear in split-second cameos, including Anne Carlisle, from ''Liquid Sky,'' and John Lurie, the star of ''Stranger Than Paradise,'' who is seen here as the silhouette of a musician behind a window shade. ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' is not, however, an inside joke. It's a New York movie that, like Times Square at 4 A.M. or Central Park at high noon, is available to everyone. ''Desperately Seeking Susan,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''parental guidance suggested''), includes some vulgar language and partial nudity.

sports/football,Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments - The New York Times The families of debilitated former N.F.L. players say the league is obstructing their access to an estimated $1 billion settlement over concussions by reflexively rejecting valid claims and bogging down the process with unreasonable demands. After a contentious five-year fight between the league and many former players who had accused the N.F.L. of hiding the dangers of head trauma, the two sides agreed in 2015 to a settlement that covers nearly every former player for the next 65 years. Now the families and their lawyers describe a succession of roadblocks as they try to claim payouts, from as little as a few thousand dollars to potentially several million dollars, to help thousands of retired players left mentally infirm, in some cases severely, from years of hits and tackles on the league’s fields. Of 1,400 claims filed so far, 140 have been approved, which legal experts say is startlingly low. The remaining 90 percent of those claims are in the process of being evaluated or have been sent back to the players and their lawyers to amend before they can be approved. The 140 approved claims are worth $195 million, but the N.F.L. has written checks for only $100 million. The remainder is expected to be released after appeals are exhausted. The league has appealed eight awards that the administrator granted, and 12 players have appealed their awards, calling them too low. The administrator also randomly audits 10 percent of all claims.
sports/football,When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order. But the N.F.L. installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals. The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men. But as a result, the players now accuse the nation’s richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all. “Players will be shorted what they earned,” said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinson’s disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing. “This is not a settlement. This is about paying sick men as little as possible.” Mr. Stewart, who was in the league from 1989 to 1993 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinson’s diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L. benefit plans. But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.
sports/football,Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, met with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs’ chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently. “Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up,” said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the league’s legal cases. “Unfortunately, the N.F.L. has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.” Orran Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise. He said that players were now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement. He said the bulk of the claims that had been sent back to players were for missing paperwork. But another group of claims has been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined. Mr. Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion. But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.
sports/football,“It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork,” Mr. Brown said. “But there’s nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this. The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.” The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each — though most will probably receive far less — for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field. A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they could submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously. Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had “growing pains” because of unanticipated problems. In this case, some former players have “pushed the envelope,” he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records. By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address “some funny things that didn’t look right,” and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Mr. Seeger said. Mr. Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L. of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.
sports/football,“Is this working perfectly? No,” Mr. Seeger said. But “if there aren’t sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem,” he said. “The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion. Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.” Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation. The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts. “I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics,” said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players. “There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims.” All 35 claims Mr. Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of “deficiencies,” he said. Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited. Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L. players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies. “The settlement was sold by the N.F.L. and Seeger as quick pay,” Mr. Luckasevic said. “This was something everyone feared. This is the N.F.L. disability plan version 2.0.”
sports/football,The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it said that stricter requirements were not added after the deal was made final. “There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized,” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Mr. Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims. The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L. under one of its regular disability plans. The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral. Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L. will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits. Mr. Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable. He was found to have Parkinson’s disease in 2009, when he was 43. Mr. Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement. But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.
sports/football,The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football. After Mr. Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis. But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four. In the deal, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award. But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then. Mr. Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career. But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing — often with the aid of painkillers — so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day. In many ways, the N.F.L. case is different from many settlements, experts said. Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt. In the N.F.L. settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S. Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players’ lawyers — many of whom receive a percentage any settlement — have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L. to be alert to fraud, experts said.
sports/football,Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million. But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments. In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L. insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims. But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud. Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he had handled, defendants had a right to try to prevent fraud. But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlement. “It’s not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door,” said Mr. Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L. case. “All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.”

nyregion,Day Out for Dad and Daughter - The New York Times Dear Diary: Nine years ago, my wife, who was pregnant at the time, and I moved away from Manhattan. Nine years later I found myself sightseeing in the city with my 9-year-old daughter. We visited some of the essentials: Grand Central Terminal, Trinity Church, Battery Park. More important, we saw where her mom and I had our first apartment together, the Spanish restaurant where her grandparents met on their first date and where her great-great-grandparents had sailed from Europe into New York Harbor. My daughter indulged my nostalgia with surprisingly little eye-rolling, and I indulged her with dim sum in Chinatown and cannoli in Little Italy. It was a beautiful day. Tired from walking, we jumped on the subway to begin making our way back home. A friendly native, her hair a bit grayer than mine, began chatting with my daughter. Listening to my daughter excitedly relive the day’s adventures, I felt wistful. Should we not have left New York? I wish I could spend more time here. As our new friend said goodbye to us on the subway platform, she too appeared wistful. “I wish I could spend the day with my dad,” she said as she walked away.

us,The Post-Boehner Congress and Washington’s Sense of Dread  - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  At the White House, a stunned President Obama expressed hope for bipartisan progress as turmoil among Republicans ended Representative John A. Boehner’s speakership. On Capitol Hill, the conservatives who had again felled one of their leaders rallied to name the terms for the next person to wield the speaker’s gavel. And on Wall Street, fear set in at the prospect of another showdown over the government’s ability to pay its debt, support its export businesses and simply keep its doors open. Mr. Boehner’s sudden announcement on Friday that he will step down from the speakership and leave the House on Oct. 30 has thrown Washington into deep uncertainty. His resignation is likely to herald an even more combative stretch in the nation’s capital, emboldening conservatives to defy Mr. Obama on looming decisions regarding spending, debt and taxes. Some in Congress and the White House hold out hope that Mr. Boehner’s departure and the election of a new speaker will break the fever among conservatives, who have been plotting his downfall for over a year, and grant his replacement a grace period. Mr. Obama promised Friday to “reach out immediately” to the next speaker to begin working on the nation’s problems. But more prevalent is a sense of dread that an already bitter and divisive political atmosphere is about to get even worse.
us,The Republican presidential primary has been dominated by outsiders like Donald J. Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson, who have castigated their party’s leadership in Washington. Now, with conservatives claiming Mr. Boehner’s demise as a political victory, many expect his successor to face tremendous pressure to bring that combative spirit to the halls of Congress, and to instigate a showdown with the president over budget limits and the debt ceiling at the end of the year. Uncompromising conservatives on and off Capitol Hill are demanding the elevation of one of their own to confront the president at every turn. And lawmakers who had pressed to get rid of Mr. Boehner warned Friday that they would not buckle in their defense of those spending limits, even in response to veto threats by Mr. Obama that could lead to a Christmastime stalemate and government shutdown. “To get members to bust the budget caps, they have to threaten a Christmas-vacation shutdown for members of Congress,” said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and one of the rebels who pushed for Mr. Boehner’s overthrow. “Heaven help the speaker who replaces John Boehner and goes along with that charade.” Mr. Boehner’s decision is likely to smooth a short-term path around a government shutdown at the end of the month. But the real showdown looms on Dec. 11, when a stopgap spending bill expected to pass this week would expire, meaning Congress and the president would have to find a way to fund the government through next September and raise its borrowing limit.
us,The new speaker, elevated to the country’s third-highest constitutional post by a conservative rebellion, will face demands from those same rebels to extract concessions from a president who has little to lose by standing firm. At stake for conservatives will be the one clear victory they have scored since the Tea Party revolution of 2010: firm statutory limits on spending signed into law in 2011, which Mr. Obama has said he can no longer abide. In turn, the Republican Party, already wrestling with the effect of Mr. Trump’s populist insurgency on its chances at the White House, could find itself with the political challenge of justifying to moderate voters yet another Washington crisis, prompted by an even more obstreperous, confrontational House majority. “Having been hoisted to the speaker’s chair by what was essentially a revolt,” David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, predicted, the next speaker will not have the freedom to compromise with the president. “This group is not installing him to pursue compromise and mutual cooperation,” Mr. Axelrod said. Presidential aides have begun to take stock of a changed political landscape that could include some last-minute deal-making with Mr. Boehner before he heads back to Ohio. There could be a longer-term budget agreement that also deals with raising the nation’s debt ceiling, and possibly even a major infrastructure bill, long talked about and long stalled. “John’s not going to leave for another 30 days, so hopefully he feels like getting as much stuff done as he possibly can,” Mr. Obama said during a news conference with the Chinese president on Friday.
us,Looking at the long term, Democrats in Washington wondered whether Republicans wanted to show Americans they could govern, if only as a means to win back the White House and keep control of the Congress that they fought so hard to gain. “For most Republicans, resolving these issues now, instead of having the government shut down in December, would be a political plus,” Phil Schiliro, Mr. Obama’s former chief liaison to Congress, said. If the next speaker “decided that he wanted now to do a fair amount of business, there’s a window to do that.” But Mr. Schiliro, too, expressed some pessimism, adding, “At its core, there’s a group of members in the House Republican caucus who affirmatively don’t want to govern if that means compromise. And governing always means compromise.”   If Mr. Boehner’s replacement is given some breathing room, the president, the new speaker and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, could fashion a compromise that lifts the debt ceiling, raises spending limits and includes savings in programs such as Medicare or veterans’ pensions to keep overall spending tamed. “The restlessness that folks feel when they feel emboldened, some of that is alleviated when there is a new election,” said Tim Griffin, the lieutenant governor of Arkansas, who was a Boehner loyalist before retiring from the House in 2014. “They feel like: ‘We tried. We got whatever we could get. Now, let’s get some things done.’ ” Other Republicans were not so sanguine.
us,“If Boehner had stayed through December, you’d feel better about this,” said Tom Davis, a retired House member from Virginia. “Now you’ve really emboldened the right. They feel at least they have a head on the mantel.” Nor is Wall Street optimistic. Chris Krueger of the investment firm Guggenheim Partners told clients on Friday that he was raising the prospects of a damaging showdown on the debt ceiling. He dismissed hopes that Mr. Boehner was about to play a bipartisan Mr. Fix-It on his way out the door. “Essentially, Boehner is the kindergarten teacher who is leaving his flock unsupervised and wants to get all the sharp objects out of the room before he goes off into the sunset,” Mr. Krueger wrote. Already, those who have egged on the rebellion are showing no willingness to give the next speaker much room for compromise. Before the news of Mr. Boehner’s decision had even sunk in, conservative knives were out for the heir apparent, Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader. Mark Levin, the conservative talk show host, called Mr. McCarthy “Eric Cantor with 10 less I.Q. points,” a reference to the last House majority leader, who lost his seat to a Tea Party insurgent in 2014. Mr. Massie, the Kentucky Republican, said simply moving the leadership below Mr. Boehner “up one notch” would show that the party remained “tone deaf” to the discontent that swept Mr. Boehner from the stage.
us,Not content with one political casualty, the Tea Party Patriots created FireTheLeader.com on Friday to drum up support to replace Mr. McConnell in the Senate leadership. Mr. Schiliro compared conservatives in Washington to people sipping water from an “unquenchable cup.” He said they would not be satisfied by Mr. Boehner’s fall. And come December, the first ballots of the presidential campaign will be just weeks away in a Republican race dominated thus far by outsiders. “In a normal year, there would be a grace period, but you’ve got guys like Ted Cruz looking for a national platform,” said Matt Kibbe, the former head of the Tea Party group FreedomWorks, who has been jousting with Republican leaders for years. “If McCarthy picks up the torch and runs the same direction, it’s going to get worse, not better.” Mr. Axelrod called Mr. Boehner’s resignation a “caustic mix” in the midst of “a presidential race in which the same factions are warring.” “It’s going to be a minefield to navigate,” he said. The outside conservative groups that Mr. Boehner had openly clashed with, and thought he had bested, claimed victory on Friday and immediately began organizing to elect a more strident conservative to lead the House through Mr. Obama’s final 15 months. Such efforts may not block Mr. McCarthy’s path, but they could force his campaign for the gavel farther to the right. Worries about his right flank helped prompt him last year to embrace the demise of the Export-Import Bank, the 81-year-old federal export credit agency, which has long had bipartisan support but has of late become a target for conservatives.
us,Mr. McCarthy will have to appeal to every end of the House Republican Conference to secure 218 votes in an open election for the speakership next month. Jenny Beth Martin, leader of the Tea Party Patriots, is already enumerating demands: an immediate vote on ending subsidies for members of Congress and the administration to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act; no debt ceiling increase without a balanced budget in five years; and, far from lifting the caps, a 1 percent cut in spending on all government programs over the next five years. Hours after Mr. Boehner’s announcement, Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas and one of the conservative hard-liners, warned, “I hope all Republicans, including those in the Senate, are listening to what grass-roots conservatives are saying: It is time for conservative leadership and conservative principles.”
business/energy-environment,Tax Overhaul in Russia Aims to Keep Country at Top of Oil-Producing Heap - The New York Times MOSCOW — Vladimir V. Putin has shown an uncanny mastery of the politics and economics of oil. On his watch as president and prime minister, Russia ascended to the top of the global business, surpassing Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer. Yet in a series of meetings over the past two years, more or less, aides have confronted Mr. Putin with evidence that Russia’s pre-eminence in the world of oil will not last if the current imposition of exceptionally high taxes on oil companies is left in place over the next decade. No matter that high taxes on oil companies are at the heart of Russia’s economic policies. The revenue pads out Russia’s rainy-day funds, which cushion its oil-dependent economy from the pain caused when the prices of commodities sold by Russia fall. The result of these meetings was a policy swivel by Mr. Putin that should keep Russia on top of the oil-producing heap and prevent the potential loss over a decade of about two million barrels of oil per day to world markets — more than is exported by Libya. The overhaul will dial back taxes on crude oil exports. The new policy, which took effect Oct. 1, was one condition that helped secure a major investment last month by Exxon Mobil.
business/energy-environment,The overhaul, known as the 60/66 program for the new tax rates it imposes, is intended to maintain Russia’s current level of oil output — about 10 million barrels per day, about half of the U.S. consumption — despite rising production costs associated with exploitation of fields in the harsh conditions of permafrost in ever more remote parts of Siberia  and offshore in the Arctic Ocean. The tax change and the opening of the Russian Arctic to joint ventures like those under the Exxon agreement suggest Mr. Putin is warming to arguments that the Russian oil industry needs more financial leeway to function and to stay ahead of the sheiks. “There is definitely a new wind blowing,” Thane Gustafson, a senior researcher at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said in a telephone interview. “There is now a very definite consensus, from Putin on down, that unless the oil companies are incentivized in not only raising recovery in the brown fields, but moving more aggressively into onshore frontiers, and offshore, the consequences will be dire,” he said. Cambridge Energy, a subsidiary of the international business information group IHS, has advised the Russian Ministry of Energy during the drafting of the new tax policy. Also acting in an advisory capacity were the consulting firm McKenzie and the auditors Ernst & Young. The companies modeled the effects of continued high taxation on Russia’s oil industry. The policy was put in place in 2004 after the arrest of the oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who had opposed the taxes. The models measured rising costs as the output from Siberian fields on land declines.
business/energy-environment,The offshore and more remote developments that will replace them are even more inhospitable than the Khanty-Mansi region of Siberia, where the primary fields are today. The study concluded that if nothing were done, total production would drop to eight million barrels of oil per day by 2020. The tax quandary highlights a key distinction between Russia’s industry and Saudi Arabia’s, which Russia displaced as the world’s largest. Saudi Arabia, encouraged by the United States, which supports the monarchy militarily, maintains the world’s largest swing production capacity. This is easier in the desert, near ports, where production costs are lower. Still, vast capital outlays are the norm. Russia, in contrast, is guided by internal considerations in its oil policies. Moscow is trying to maintain an industrial economy alongside its oil businesses, so it taxes oil companies heavily — but the outcome has been taxation so high it has starved the industry of capital, even as production is moving offshore in Siberia. To check the decline that is projected as a result, the government lowered mineral extraction and crude oil export duties for the first time since 2004 under the overhaul, from 65 percent to 60 percent — the 60 in the 60/66 program. Petroleum exports account for 40 percent of Russia’s budget revenues. To compensate for this loss to the budget, the overhaul raised the export duty on refined products to 66 percent, from 52 percent, and eliminated an even lower rate for the low-grade fuel known as bunker oil that Russian refineries have been exporting in great abundance.
business/energy-environment,The program to prolong high levels of oil output in Russia will also, of course, prolong Russia’s dependence on crude oil prices for its economic well-being. The previous system reflected industrial policy, now partially abandoned. The relatively lower export duty on refined products was a continuation of a Soviet policy of encouraging industrial production over raw materials exports, an idea championed by Mr. Putin. The intention was to encourage a domestic refining industry, with the jobs and additional profits that would, in theory, accrue from exporting gasoline, diesel or aviation fuel, rather than crude. The problem was, the country’s Soviet-legacy refineries produced far less gasoline and other light distillates per barrel of oil than Western refineries — and far more bunker oil than Russia could consume domestically. In 2004, export tariffs on this fuel were lowered to about 30 percent to help refineries dispose of it. The result was an incentive to invest in new refineries that produced lots of bunker oil, rather than in oil fields. Russian oil companies earn about $10 in profit per barrel of oil pumped from the ground, even at prices higher than $100. If the company, however, operated a highly inefficient refinery producing copious amounts of bunker oil, it would earn an additional profit of about $23 per barrel because of the lower tax, according to Aleksandr Bulgansky, a senior oil analyst at Otkritie Bank in Moscow. Companies built intentionally inefficient refineries, nicknamed “samovars,” modeled on early 20th century refineries that simply boiled crude, rather than use catalysts to produce more gasoline. About 250 operate today.
business/energy-environment,Russia exports about three million barrels per day of refined product, compared with four million barrels of crude.Rather than striving to fix the refining subsidies, this project has largely been abandoned under the new program, in favor of companies that actually explore and drill for oil, critical to Russia’s economy and accounting for 17 percent of gross domestic product. The policy overhaul that will maintain Russia’s current levels of oil output into the next decade coincided with Mr. Putin’s announcement that he intends to run for president again. From the earliest days of his presidency, Mr. Putin decided that natural resources exports and energy in particular, could not only finance Russia’s rebirth, but also help restore geopolitical greatness. Oil companies, of course, embrace the lower taxes, too. “This will allow us to keep production at high levels and increase capital investment at our upstream assets,” Dmitry Sergeev, spokesman for TNK-BP, said of the change. So important was the Russian tax system to oil investment that Exxon’s agreement with Rosneft included a provision that Exxon and the Russian government would agree to consult on tax matters as a condition of investment.
us,The Fire Is Roaring Over the Ridge. It’s Time to Go. - The New York Times
us,Deal Averts Trial of Guantánamo Prisoner, Omar Khadr - The New York Times WASHINGTON — A former child soldier being held at the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, pleaded guilty on Monday to terrorism-related charges, averting the awkward prospect that he would be the first person  to stand trial before a military commission under the Obama administration. The defendant, Omar Khadr, 24, a Canadian, admitted to a military judge that he threw a grenade that killed an American soldier during a 2002 firefight and that he had planted 10 roadside bombs for Al Qaeda. Mr. Khadr, born in Toronto, was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan. By avoiding the need for a trial of Mr. Khadr, the deal represents a breakthrough for the Obama administration’s legal team, which had been dismayed that his case was to become the inaugural run of a new-look commissions system — undermining their efforts to rebrand the tribunals as a fair and just venue for prosecuting terrorism suspects. Mr. Khadr’s decision to plead guilty was a turnabout from his vow to never accept such an arrangement lest it allow the United States to save face. He contended that he was coerced by older relatives into working with Al Qaeda and was not at fault. In exchange for pleading guilty to five charges — including murder in violation of the law of war, supporting terrorism and spying — Mr. Khadr was spared the risk of a life sentence. A panel of seven military officers will decide the length of his prison sentence.
us,But his plea agreement is believed to cap the potential time at eight years, on top of the eight he has been in custody. The deal followed a complex flurry of negotiations, including a side deal reached on Saturday between the United States and Canada allowing Mr. Khadr, after a year, to apply for transfer to Canadian custody to serve out the remainder of his sentence. The commission system, set up by  President George W. Bush in November 2001, has been contentious. The Supreme Court struck down one version in 2006, and it has produced only a handful of convictions. President Obama campaigned for the White House as a critic of the Bush administration’s version of military commissions. One of his first acts after taking office was halting all tribunal prosecutions then in process — including the case against Mr. Khadr. But Mr. Obama and his advisers later decided that it was necessary to keep a form of the tribunals if some detainees were to receive any trial. The commission rules provided greater flexibility than civilian court about the admission of evidence like hearsay and material gathered from the battlefield. The administration spent months working with Congress to set up new rules providing greater defendant protections. It restarted the tribunals in November 2009, hoping that the overhaul would change their global image as a second-class justice system. Some allies have refused to provide evidence or witnesses for use in the tribunals.
us,No one intended Mr. Khadr’s case to become the first trial under the revamped system, complicating efforts to showcase the reforms. But in August, a 50-year-old Sudanese detainee pleaded guilty, and Mr. Khadr’s case was already well developed and next in line. In July 2002, Mr. Khadr, who comes from a Qaeda-linked family, was found wounded at a Qaeda compound in Afghanistan that had been attacked by United States troops. A grenade blast in that firefight killed an Army sergeant, Christopher Speer. Investigators concluded that Mr. Khadr probably threw the grenade. A videotape found at the compound was said to show Mr. Khadr making and planting roadside bombs. Several factors made prosecuting Mr. Khadr for war crimes unusual. The centerpiece of the charges was not a conventional terrorism offense — targeting civilians — but killing an enemy soldier in combat. Usually in war, battlefield killing is not prosecuted. But the United States contended that Mr. Khadr lacked battlefield immunity because he wore no uniform, among other requirements of the laws of war. The uniform issue also led to a scramble by the Obama legal team to rewrite commission rules on the eve of a hearing for Mr. Khadr. Because Central Intelligence Agency drone operators also kill while not wearing uniforms, the team rewrote the rules to downgrade “murder in violation of the laws of war” to a domestic law offense from a war crime to avoid seeming to implicitly concede that the C.I.A. is committing war crimes.
us,Moreover, child soldiers are almost never prosecuted for war crimes. That meant that the world coverage of Mr. Khadr’s case was dominated by questions about whether the case was appropriate. On Monday, for example, Human Rights Watch said the United States “should never have pursued the case” because convicting someone of war crimes for actions taken as a juvenile for the first time since World War II “sets a terrible precedent.” In an e-mail to The New York Times, Mr. Khadr’s military  lawyer, Lt. Col. Jon Jackson, said he planned to tell the sentencing panel that his client is a “decent young man” who “deserves a first chance at a meaningful life.” In a phone interview,  Capt. John F. Murphy of the Navy, the tribunals’ chief prosecutor, said Mr. Khadr was a convicted murderer and terrorist, not an innocent victim. “He was convicted with the strongest evidence that exists under the law, which is his own admission under oath and in open court,” Mr. Murphy said. Captain Murphy said he told prosecutors to “re-engage” Mr. Khadr’s defense about a plea deal in August. He did not say whether he had discussed the matter with administration officials, but stressed that his handling of the case was “my own independent decision alone” and “not the result of any political interference with the case.” The plea deal leaves only one remaining case currently on the tribunal docket: Noor Uthman Muhammed, a Sudanese detainee accused of running a terrorist training camp and of planning to participate in a terrorist operation against Israel. His trial is scheduled for February.
world/asia,Not ‘Lone Wolves’ After All: How ISIS Guides World’s Terror Plots From Afar - The New York Times HYDERABAD, India — When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India’s major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims. For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State’s first strike on Indian soil. They vetted each new member of the cell as Mr. Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement. And from Syria, investigators believe, the group’s virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots. Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here last June, the Islamic State’s cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times. As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Mr. Yazdani’s offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by the Islamic State whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet.
world/asia,In the most basic enabled attacks, Islamic State handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their interlocutors in the Islamic State, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Tex., were initially labeled the work of “lone wolves,” with no operational ties to the Islamic State, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group’s method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a safe haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training.
world/asia,Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State’s name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. “They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process — from radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot,” said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. “If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.” Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Mr. Yazdani’s case presents one of the most detailed accounts to date of how the Islamic State is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group’s reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York.
world/asia,“I fear this is the future of ISIS,” said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. Until roughly a year ago, Islamic State recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a “hijrah,” the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad’s journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the Islamic State’s most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Mr. Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were already actively recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group.
world/asia,But by the late spring of 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both American and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was Amriki himself, who was killed along with his wife on April 22, 2016, when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa’ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of the Islamic State’s “external attack planners” who “actively sought to harm Western interests.” The Department of Defense’s account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Mr. Yazdani, Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across America, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Mr. Lutchman reached out to Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. “Dream come true,” Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint.
world/asia,Instead, the handler suggested that Mr. Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year’s Eve — less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an “operation” and kill “1000000s of kuffar,” Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Mr. Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other “brothers” to take part. They stayed in contact as Mr. Lutchman went to Walmart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar’s customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Mr. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an F.B.I. informant. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler’s voice, or saw so much as a photograph of him, according to the court filings.
world/asia,By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadists, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, Islamic State operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other Islamic State colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, the Islamic State announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. “If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,” the group’s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. At the time Amriki was killed last April, he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.
world/asia,One of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad’s Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching the Islamic State’s online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate. “Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,” Mr. Yazdani told investigators from India’s National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company. He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group’s preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki. “I created a Telegram ID,” Mr. Yazdani told investigators, “and sought his guidance to reach Syria.” After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki’s directions changed course: “He asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.” It was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, “WindsofVictory.” His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.
world/asia,The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves “Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,” the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name. At the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men’s interrogations. “It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),” Mr. Mohammed told investigators. “We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.” When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them. Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees — around $1,000 — and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.
world/asia,Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said. The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork. As soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive. Once that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a “bayah,” to the Islamic State’s leader.
world/asia,Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to www.gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email. By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men’s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said. The men’s families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them. One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.
world/asia,Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the Islamic State’s stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone. The first time that officials in Europe described an attack as having been “télécommandé,” or remote-controlled, was in the spring of 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg. When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times. “OK, brother, now pay attention,” one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. “Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Mégane,” the message said. “Look at the front right tire — you’ll find the keys placed on top.” The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched.
world/asia,Later, French investigators said they had found that Mr. Ghlam’s handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Mr. Ghlam’s plot. Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially “quarterbacking” the attack: “They’re from there, so they can essentially tell someone, ‘O.K., go 10 yards and go this way.” Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects’ phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world. In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager’s handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax — “The damage would be much greater,” the handler advised — but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. “I want to enter paradise tonight,” he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper. In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris.
world/asia,And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money. In several, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home. Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested so far had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said. While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed the Islamic State to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks. Instead of opening fire on a church, Mr. Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the Islamic State recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself. The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest.
world/asia,“He didn’t even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say that the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is now one of the Islamic State’s most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group’s capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Mr. Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Mr. Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the embassy of Myanmar. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Mr. Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of Amriki’s followers in Hyderabad.
world/asia,The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mr. Mohammed’s home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. “We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,” Mr. Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to “cook the rice.” By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mr. Mohammed’s home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.
world/asia,A Deadly Deployment, a Navy SEAL’s Despair - The New York Times It was his last night of what his men were already calling a cursed deployment in Afghanistan. Cmdr. Job W. Price had signed off on the final report on the ambush killing of an enlisted Navy SEAL team member. His staff had completed a plan to turn over American military outposts to their Afghan partners, and Commander Price had given an unusually emotional thanks to his team for its service. His executive officer noticed that the commander’s Sig Sauer pistol was out on his desk that night, Dec. 21, 2012, where he had never seen it before. By the time Commander Price went back to his room, the photograph of his 9-year-old daughter was gone from his desk. In his trouser pocket was a report on the recent death of an Afghan girl in an explosion near an American base. When Commander Price, the 42-year-old leader of SEAL Team 4, did not appear for a meeting the next morning with an Afghan general, his men searched in the mess hall, in the showers and finally along the row of berths called the Green Mile. In his room, they found him lying in his sleeping bag, the pistol in his hand, a pool of blood beneath the bed. His death was shocking: Suicide was rare among SEALs, unusual during a deployment in a war zone and unprecedented for a high-achieving SEAL officer. He became the last SEAL to die in Afghanistan.
world/asia,Everything had seemed to go wrong in Commander Price’s final deployment, which began in September. In short order, he lost four men — two SEAL team members, two Army soldiers — under his command. Relations with the United States military’s Afghan partners were tainted by distrust, and the Taliban were growing dominant in the remote region of southeastern Afghanistan where Commander Price’s forces were operating. By then, America’s hopes of defeating the Taliban were fading, and the military’s ambitions were focused on extricating its troops from daily combat. For a commander of elite Special Operations troops, whose counterparts in SEAL Team 6  had been celebrated for pulling off daring missions like killing Osama bin Laden and rescuing Capt. Richard Phillips from Somali pirates without taking any casualties, the burdens in Afghanistan may have felt especially heavy. In an era of long-distance drone strikes and a reluctance to commit American troops to ground operations, the country’s demand for antiseptic war had already resulted in growing pressure on officers not to lose men in combat. Commander Price told confidants that his superior had said to him shortly before the team deployed to Afghanistan to bring everyone home. The Navy said the officer, Capt. Robert E. Smith, typically passed along that common guidance to his team leaders. But with the United States pulling back, other military officers were urging their men to exercise greater caution, several of them said.
world/asia,“Commanders were no longer judging successful deployments by the tried and true standards of enemies killed on the battlefield, but by the number of casualties their own people suffered,” Capt. Milton J. Sands, a former SEAL team commander, told Navy investigators looking into the death of Commander Price, his friend. He left behind no note or explanation, and mental health experts caution that it is often impossible to know definitively what motivated a suicide. Agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service interviewed dozens of aides, friends and relatives over the next year and a half before a Navy death review board concluded that Commander Price had killed himself. One former SEAL team member called the investigators to suggest that the commander might have been murdered, and some colleagues and friends, surprised that no one had heard the gunshot, remain suspicious. His family still struggles to understand how Commander Price, named after the biblical man of faith who overcame adversity, could take his own life. “I can’t see my son acting that way: no note, no email, no telephone messages, nothing leading up to it,” his father, Harry Price, said in an interview. In his home in Pottstown, Pa., Mr. Price was surrounded by photographs of his son — as a boy in scuba mask and flippers in the bathtub, as a standout high school football player and wrestler, and as a young SEAL team member in camouflage, holding a gun.
world/asia,But those who saw him close up in Afghanistan provided an intimate portrait of a perfectionist leader unraveling in plain sight. Seemingly overwhelmed by the unpredictable environment that had cost his men’s lives, he became withdrawn and fatigued from lack of sleep and a nagging infection. Aides, who said they had tried to intervene, described themselves as unnerved by his hours of staring into space, his sudden indecisiveness and his aversion to risk. Commander Price “had a look of defeat,” his adviser on Afghan tribal affairs told investigators. “I personally wondered if he was at a breaking point.” He had told someone close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern about being ostracized from the tight-knit SEAL community, that team commander was the loneliest position he had ever held. He felt unable to confide in the men above or below him for fear of looking weak. Several fellow officers saw Commander Price’s death as a cautionary tale of how men were ground down by so many years of fighting. “We like to fancy ourselves as ‘we’re the most resilient guys in the world,’ ” said Tom Chaby, a retired SEAL captain who headed a United States Special Operations Command initiative to encourage troops to seek help for mental health issues. But “after you’re at war, 11 years for Job, we’re all beat up,” he added.
world/asia,Retired Rear Adm. Edward G. Winters III, who headed the Naval Special Warfare Command until 2011, said it was hard to predict how officers would react to losing people under them. He said officers who knew Commander Price had reported that he blamed himself for the deaths of his men. “You realize that guys lost their lives,” Admiral Winters said, and in pulling out of the outposts sooner than planned, “we’re going to leave the place worse than when we got there.” By 2012, the American troop withdrawal was well underway even though peace talks with the Taliban had faltered. The SEAL team members had to watch for rocket attacks, improvised explosive devices and ambushes. In addition, there had been a surge in attacks by the Afghan security services on their American allies; so-called green-on-blue shootings had become a crisis. Commander Price understood the dangers going in. He had traveled to Afghanistan that spring for briefings by Cmdr. Mike Hayes, a friend who headed SEAL Team 2 as well as the task force Commander Price would be taking over. He was there when Commander Hayes called in Navy investigators to deal with four Army soldiers’ accusations that three SEAL team members had abused detainees at an outpost in Kalach, in Oruzgan Province, leading to one Afghan’s death. An Air Force Academy graduate — he had been inspired by his uncle, an Air Force colonel during the Vietnam War — and avid sky diver, Commander Price had switched his commission to the Navy for a chance to join the SEALs.
world/asia,“As he told me, ‘I wanted to be with the best, and they’re the best, so O.K.,’ ” his father said. Even as a young man, he knew his own mind, choosing to attend the public high school in Pottstown instead of the fancy boarding school, the Hill School, where his father was an administrator. He grew into his 6-foot-2 frame, becoming a standout football player and heavyweight wrestler. He played the strategy board game Risk, drove an old Plymouth station wagon with a quirky bulldog hood ornament and loved to quote the Bill Murray military satire, “Stripes.” His friends and family knew him as a doting husband and father and as a practical joker, a cutup who would be the first to dance at weddings, though not always well. A fellow Navy officer called him “tough and empathetic.” But subordinates in the SEAL teams described him as a workaholic taskmaster, somewhat aloof from his men. Early in his career, he had been forced to quit a training exercise. Although others thought it did not reflect poorly on him, he was embarrassed by the incident and always felt he had to prove himself, a friend told investigators. (Like others in the N.C.I.S. report, the friend’s name was redacted.) Dennis DeBobes, a retired SEAL commander who served with him, said Commander Price had been stationed in Rota, Spain, when the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred. After that, “Job went into his hyper-focused mode,” Commander DeBobes said in an interview. “There was not a hard job out there that Job didn’t fight for.”
world/asia,Before he took over SEAL Team 4, Commander Price had deployed a dozen times, including to Afghanistan and Iraq, where a man from his unit was killed, and had been awarded four Bronze Stars. He worked such long hours in the 15 months he spent preparing his team for the 2012 tour in Afghanistan that his executive officer told investigators he had twice informed the commander that he could not keep up. Once they hit the ground in September, SEAL units and other troops under Commander Price were spread thin in small outposts across a vast area of southeastern Afghanistan. They worked alongside militias known as the Afghan Local Police, training them and trying to win over the populace. Commander Price found meetings with the villagers difficult, aides recalled, and tried to cut the discussions short, even though hearing the elders out was part of the village-stability strategy. Still, he was initially upbeat and chatty in emails home, telling one relative to “send some of that donut shop coffee” over. The seven-month deployment was expected to be relatively easy, given that much of it would occur during the winter, which was not the fighting season. But before long, one of the SEALs sustained a gunshot wound serious enough to be sent home. Then, in late October, an Afghan police officer killed two Army soldiers assigned to the task force, Sgt. Clinton K. Ruiz and Staff Sgt. Kashif M. Memon. The assailant came from Chora District in Oruzgan Province, where the detainee abuse was said to have occurred months before, though no evidence has emerged to link the episodes.
world/asia,A week later in Zabul Province, east of Kandahar, militants attacked a SEAL patrol. Petty Officer Second Class Matthew G. Kantor, 22, braved machine-gun fire to protect his teammates and was mortally wounded. His death hit Commander Price hard, friends and family said. He knew that his predecessor running the task force, Commander Hayes, had lost no men. Less than two months into the deployment, his command had already suffered three fatalities. With the exception of a SEAL Team 6 member who died in a hostage rescue operation that fall, Commander Price’s men would be the final SEAL fatalities in Afghanistan. His suicide would bring the toll to 49 in a decade. On Nov. 24, two days after Thanksgiving, some SEAL Team 4 members and Afghan commandos went on a morning patrol in Oruzgan Province. Petty Officer First Class Kevin R. Ebbert, 32, was in the lead position, standing on a ledge. The cliff face behind him exploded, spraying him with shrapnel. Assailants, presumed to be Taliban militants, had fired an explosive round, most likely a .38-millimeter grenade, and then poured on small-arms fire. Petty Officer Ebbert took a direct hit. He fell from the ledge and landed headfirst in a crevasse, dead. A military inquiry found that the mission had been appropriately planned. The report noted, however, that images of the target area “did not accurately depict the severity of the terrain.” Commander Price took that as criticism, telling colleagues that he felt the investigating officer had “thrown us under the bus.”
world/asia,Petty Officer Ebbert was popular and had spoken up for Commander Price when the other enlisted men grumbled. He had joined up after his father, who had served with the SEALs in Vietnam and suffered from post-traumatic stress, died in 2003. Trained as a medic, he told his family in a video chat on Thanksgiving that he had been accepted to medical school and that his commander was helping him secure an early release from the Navy to prepare. He might be home for good, he said, by mid-January. “Commander Price sent me a personal handwritten letter, and it was very heartfelt,” his mother, Charlie Jordan, said in an interview. “It was almost a sixth sense I got from it as I read his letter that he was truly moved.” Some SEAL team members saw Petty Officer Ebbert’s death as a turning point. “It seemed like everyone’s motivation was zapped, and people started complaining that this was the worst deployment/leadership they had seen,” the tribal adviser told investigators, according to the N.C.I.S. report. Commander Price’s health began to break down. He traveled constantly to visit troops in the field, flying out early in the morning. The deaths of the men under his command were also consuming, with ceremonies, inquiries and paperwork. In addition, he was receiving “an overwhelming amount of top-down direction,” the tribal adviser told the Navy investigators, with orders to accelerate the closing of most of the outposts.
world/asia,The command lawyer later told the N.C.I.S. that Commander Price had become “increasingly withdrawn, abrupt, erratic, lethargic and disheveled.” One aide observed him sitting with his head in his hands for hours. He was “disengaged,” according to one witness statement, “appearing not to absorb what was being said.” By that point in the deployment, however, exhaustion was common among the headquarters staff in Tirin Kot, the capital of Oruzgan. Commander Price’s executive officer told investigators that he had served under seven commanding officers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that “all exhibited similar signs of strain under the pressures of command in combat.” Mr. Chaby, the retired captain, said that as a SEAL commander on deployment, he had kept a sleep log and averaged two hours and 53 minutes a night for seven months. “I suspect Job slept less than I did,” he said. “I often went to his room late at night and found him lying in bed fully clothed,” Commander Price’s executive officer recalled, according to the N.C.I.S. report. “I asked him every night for the last four weeks … what is going on boss? … what is burdening you that I don’t see or know about?” Commander Price responded that nothing was wrong. In early December, the executive officer and four other top officers and enlisted men staged an intervention. Commander Price acknowledged that Petty Officer Ebbert’s death “weighed heavily on him,” his officers told the N.C.I.S. With no psychologist on site, his men tried to help him get more sleep, pushing back his 9 a.m. “battle update brief” to 11 a.m. and assuring him that they could help work through any problems.
world/asia,Captain Smith, who was in charge of all SEAL teams based on the East Coast, and Vice Adm. Sean A. Pybus, who was then the top SEAL admiral and is now deputy commander of the United States Special Operations Command, visited from Dec. 7 to 9, touring some of the outposts with Commander Price. Capt. Amy Derrick, a Navy spokeswoman, said that Captain Smith said he “did not notice anything out of the ordinary.” Still, she said, he “reminded Price that sleep, nutrition and exercise are beneficial ways to relieve stress in a combat environment.” The day they departed, Commander Price was found to have a respiratory infection, which compounded his trouble sleeping and wore him down mentally, the investigative report said. On Dec. 13, medical personnel prescribed 15 tablets of Valium for anxiety and stress. Four days later, he went to the clinic complaining of dehydration and was given two 500-milliliter bags of saline. He asked the medics not to document the visit in his medical record. Even though the military has stepped up efforts to identify and treat mental health problems, many SEAL team members say they fear that acknowledging such problems is a career ender. There are no definitive statistics on suicides by current and former SEALs, though at least three have been publicly confirmed. Little more than a month before Commander Price died, his wife, Stephanie, forwarded him an email about the suicide of Robert Guzzo, 33, a former SEAL team member who had struggled with post-traumatic stress. “Sad,” she wrote, according to the N.C.I.S. report. “Luv u.”
world/asia,On Dec. 16, an explosion shook a valley in Oruzgan. American personnel nearby heard it, and a team of Afghan special forces found the body of a little girl. The site, close to an outpost Commander Price was responsible for overseeing, had been used for mortar firing, but a United States military report said that no unexploded ordnance had been left on the ground and that the only dud had been cleared, leaving the cause of the blast a mystery. Mrs. Price would later tell investigators that her husband was “upset because of local national children being brought to their base to receive treatment for injuries caused by I.E.D.s and random gunfire.” She had been concerned about him for a while and tried to cheer him in mid-December by sending their daughter’s school progress report, noting how well she was doing in music, according to the N.C.I.S. document. One of Commander Price’s friends told investigators that when he stopped by the couple’s house in Virginia to deliver a Christmas present for the girl, Mrs. Price said she was worried that her husband “seemed a little down.” She also told the wife of one of her husband’s aides that he seemed to be under a lot of stress. But on Dec. 21, Commander Price seemed more at peace, smiling and making jokes, and announced that he had finally started to sleep again and was feeling better, his staff said. A Christmas card from his parents had arrived, and he was working with his wife on a Christmas note to the spouses of SEAL Team 4. He hugged his executive officer and thanked the others with obvious emotion.
world/asia,He and his staff also put two difficult issues behind them, as he signed off on the report on Petty Officer Ebbert’s death and his aides completed a final briefing on plans to turn over the outposts to the Afghans. The next morning, a colleague could not find Commander Price for a meeting with an Afghan general, so he knocked on the door to his room twice, found it unlocked and went in. It was not until he fully entered the room that he noticed all the blood. He could not detect a pulse in Commander Price’s left wrist, and found his skin cold. His daughter’s photo was on his desk, and the folded report on the death of the Afghan girl was still in the pocket of his utility trousers, slung across a nearby couch. For members of his family, questions linger three years after his death. Their doubts were exacerbated, they say, by how few of his comrades visited them afterward and by the difficulty they had wresting documents about his death from the military. They still wonder how no aides heard the gunshot — some recalled only an indistinct noise — in the cramped quarters and whether all the forensic evidence was analyzed properly before his body was cremated. “It’s hard with the secrecy and the way no one is willing to talk to us,” said his sister, Bronwyn De Maso. “No matter how he died, if he did kill himself, he was a casualty of war.”
us,More Than 1,000 in Arizona Are Watched for Measles - The New York Times DENVER — Arizona health officials on Thursday were tracking more than 1,000 people, including at least 195 children, who might have been exposed to measles as part of an outbreak that began at Disneyland in Southern California and has grown to 67 cases in seven states. Arizona has seven confirmed cases of measles, and officials in three counties in the Phoenix area — Maricopa, Gila and Pinal — are asking residents who have not been vaccinated and who might have been exposed to stay home from school, work or day care for 21 days. The announcement comes as thousands of people are arriving in Phoenix for the Super Bowl on Sunday. “This is a critical point in this outbreak,” the state health director, Will Humble, wrote on his blog. Any missed cases, he wrote, could cause “a long and protracted outbreak.” In a conference call with reporters, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official advised anyone with symptoms not to attend the Super Bowl. “The very large outbreaks we’ve seen around the world often started with a small number of cases,” said the official, Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the agency’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Health officials said that one of Arizona’s cases involved a woman who had recently walked into a Maricopa County pediatric clinic, potentially exposing about 200 children. She had been in contact with a family that had traveled to Disneyland, but she did not know then that she had the disease.
us,Measles is a viral illness that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. Before vaccinations became common in 1963, about three million to four million Americans contracted it each year, according to the C.D.C., and about 400 to 500 died from it. Besides Arizona, the recent California outbreak has spread to Colorado, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah and Washington, as well as to Mexico. Health officials are concerned that opposition to childhood vaccinations has prompted a resurgence of an illness that the country believed it had eliminated in 2000. California has 79 confirmed cases of measles, some not related to the Disneyland outbreak. Arizona requires children to be vaccinated for measles and other diseases before attending school, unless a parent files for an exemption citing personal beliefs. There has been a rise in the number of parents choosing not to vaccinate: In 2004, 1.6 percent of kindergartners in Arizona were not vaccinated; by 2013, that number was 4.7 percent. “It allows the disease to get into those areas and really establish a foothold, and once it establishes a foothold, it’s very, very difficult to control,” said Dr. Cara Christ, the state’s chief medical officer. Five of the seven measles cases in Arizona are in Kearny, a copper mining town of about 2,000 residents. Four of those cases are from a family that recently visited Disneyland. Residents have begun keeping young children at home after school, Mayor Sam Hosler said. And local establishments have posted notices advising passers-by of the time and date when measles-infected people passed through.
us,“We were lucky,” said Rich Walker, a manager at Kearny Health Mart Pharmacy, which had a visit Jan. 22 from a man later found to have the illness. All of his colleagues, he said, had been vaccinated, and few customers were in the store at the time. In Maricopa County, three clinics have had a surge in visitors requesting measles vaccinations for their children, according to health officials, who reported a 50 percent rise in vaccination requests over last year. The clinics have added nurses, and lines have begun to form. One visitor was a parent from Mesa who had two children, ages 12 and 14, who had not received measles vaccinations. “If you’re trying to make lemonade out of the situation,” said Jeanene Fowler, a spokeswoman for the county health department, “that’s the best we can ask for.”
us,Air Force Failed to Report Dozens of Service Members to Gun Database - The New York Times Dozens of Air Force service members charged with or convicted of serious crimes were never reported to the federal gun background-check database as required, Air Force officials said on Tuesday. The revelation came after the Air Force disclosed that it had failed to report the domestic violence conviction of Devin P. Kelley, the gunman who opened fire at a church in Texas this month. Under federal law, Mr. Kelley’s court-martial conviction for domestic assault should have prevented him from purchasing at a gun store the rifle he used in the attack, as well as other guns he acquired over the past four years. After the Air Force admitted on Nov. 6 that officials at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico had failed to report the results of Mr. Kelley’s court-martial to the federal background database, it began an investigation into how many other serious incidents had not been reported. Although officials have only examined a portion of the cases, several dozen have already surfaced that were not reported but should have been. “The error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” the Air Force said in a statement. “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” Air Force officials say they are reviewing the results of the inquiry to date to assess whether to take any punitive action against personnel who failed to report Mr. Kelley’s conviction.
us,The Air Force review is only one part of a wide-ranging investigation into the background-check reporting process underway inside the military and the Justice Department in the aftermath of the church massacre. Mr. Kelley, who pleaded guilty at a 2012 court-martial to assaulting his wife at the time and fracturing his stepson’s skull, killed 25 people in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Nov. 5. The victims included a pregnant women whose fetus also died. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, citing the lapses in the Kelley case, last week ordered a federal review of the background-check database by the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to ensure that the military and other federal agencies are reporting all required cases. “The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is critical for us to be able to keep guns out of the hands of those that are prohibited from owning them,” Mr. Sessions said. “The recent shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, revealed that relevant information may not be getting reported to the N.I.C.S. — this is alarming and it is unacceptable.” In addition to the Air Force investigation, the Pentagon’s inspector general is looking into the handling of Mr. Kelley’s court-martial conviction records and whether procedures are in place to ensure cases from other service branches are also sent to the database as required. The Army chief of staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said that he believed there were also a significant number of omissions of soldiers’ records that should have been sent to the federal database.
us,And the number of cases that were not properly reported by the Air Force could grow: There have been about 60,000 incidents in the Air Force since 2002 involving service members that potentially should have been reported to the federal background-check database. All of those incidents are now being reviewed by Air Force officials to see which ones were required to be reported, and how many of those actually were. Air Force officials were unable to say on Tuesday how many of those 60,000 cases have gone through the review process so far. While that review is expected to continue for several months, Air Force officials say they are moving to fix problems that prevented Mr. Kelley’s conviction from being reported. And officials emphasized that they would continue to send previously unreported cases to the federal database as soon as they discover them. Among other things, the new directive includes a requirement that personnel at the Air Force Office of Special Investigations must confirm that reportable cases have been entered into the federal database by seeing either a printout or a screenshot from the database. Don Christensen, who was the chief prosecutor in the Air Force and is now president of Protect Our Defenders, a nonprofit group that supports greater protections for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in the military, said the measures were long overdue.
us,“I’m not surprised that they are finding these lapses, because this was clearly never a priority in the past,” Mr. Christensen said. “Earlier inspector general investigations found that they were not doing this properly, and the leadership never made it a priority to correct it.” Even if Mr. Kelley’s conviction had been in the federal database, he could still have purchased a gun online or in person from private sellers not required to run a background check — an exemption known as the “gun show loophole.” In Texas, Claryce Holcombe, who lost eight family members in the attack, has filed a wrongful death claim against the Air Force over the death of her son, Bryan Holcombe, who was shot in the back and died on the floor of the church. Ms. Holcombe’s claim states that her son’s death “was caused, in whole or in part, by the institutional failures” of the Pentagon and the Air Force, which negligently and recklessly “failed to report pertinent criminal arrest, conviction and military discharge information.” An Air Force spokeswoman said the Air Force does not comment on specific claims, but that every such claim is “thoroughly investigated and researched in accordance with established law and regulations.”
sports/football,New Rule at N.F.L.’s Camps: No Tackling. It’s Just Practice. - The New York Times Pro football summer training camps were once filled with two practices a day, grueling sessions that featured helmeted players clashing gladiator-style under a merciless sun. That was before the average N.F.L. salary soared to more than $2 million, forcing coaches and owners to weigh the risk and cost of preseason injuries. At the same time, the athletic community has been responding to research outlining the cumulative, debilitating effects of recurrent head trauma, even in practice. What’s left is a training camp landscape that would have been unrecognizable 10 years ago. As 32 N.F.L. teams opened their camps, the new practice model virtually prohibits tackling and tolerates only nominal full-scale contact between the players, often no more than five minutes a week. At N.F.L. training camps across the nation this week, it’s as if a bunch of touch football games have broken out. The trend against tackling and what is known in football parlance as “live contact” began about five years ago, but it has been especially pronounced this summer. This week, after season-ending knee injuries cost the Philadelphia Eagles two of their starters, Coach Chip Kelly, in his first year with the team, banned tackling for the duration of training camp. Coaches for the Carolina Panthers have issued a similar edict and have been reprimanding any player who knocks someone to the ground. Six days into their training camp, the Giants on Thursday were expecting to wear full pads and engage in limited live contact for the first time.
sports/football,“The amount of contact now is pretty minimal,” the Giants co-owner John Mara said Tuesday, standing near his team’s practice. “I would contend it’s just not necessary. So this has been a good thing.” But if the job of defensive football players is to tackle, don’t they need to practice it? And don’t the running backs and receivers need to practice avoiding tacklers? In spring training in baseball, the batters don’t hit off a tee and the pitchers don’t throw only to catchers. Giants Coach Tom Coughlin conceded there was a challenge to preparing 300-pound players for a violent game without letting teammates turn their ferocity on one another. “In this day and age, it’s a very fine line and it is not easy,” Coughlin said. “You’ve got to get a team ready to play and they’ve got to be physical, but you can’t step over the line. It’s not worth it.” Philadelphia’s Kelly called it “a dance that everybody’s got to dance,” adding that his players would have four preseason games with unrestricted tackling. Some teams also schedule scrimmages with other teams. “They’ll get plenty of hitting in the games,” Kelly said. “But we’ve got to get our guys to the games.” At parts of every training camp practice — sessions now conducted only once a day, as mandated by a new labor agreement — there is contact between players. Linemen knock shoulders, although not often at full speed. Wide receivers and defensive backs jostle during pass routes, and running backs sprint through narrow gaps between linemen. But almost every time a ball carrier is encountered by a defensive player, that defender will feint a tackle, then merely tap or tag the offensive player.
sports/football,Infrequently, there is a shoulder lowered to deliver a glancing blow, but in the new N.F.L., except in sporadic cases, defenders in training camp do not use their arms to wrap up a ball carrier and drag or thrust him to the ground. “There is just too much threat of injury to bring a guy down during practice,” said Chase Blackburn, Carolina’s middle linebacker. Much of this new model reflects the evolution of a pro football training camp that, in many ways, is not what it used to be. Gone are days when practices were full of primal confrontations and when coaches deprived players of water breaks because they believed it toughened them for the harshest conditions of the regular season. “I remember working at training camp when the players were allowed one little cup of Gatorade per practice,” said Mara, whose father was a Giants owner and who is attending his 52nd training camp this summer. “That was my job — one cup per player — and let me tell you, it was a difficult rule to enforce. We just didn’t know better.” The modern camp has a water brigade that trolls the grounds hydrating the players with various liquids. Multiple athletic trainers line the fields. Every step is videotaped by camera operators hoisted in cranes so that practice exercises can be analyzed in evening meetings.
sports/football,Many players come into camp in top physical condition, and most of the drills are about technique, not brute force. Rest is common, and if there is yelling from the coaches, it’s usually directed at a player who has forgotten a page in the four-inch-thick playbook, not at someone not playing with fury. A practice itinerary is distributed to everyone beforehand, with segments scheduled to the second. An air horn blast announces the beginning and end of each portion of practice, with players trotting from station to station like worker bees. The regular-season games may still be three hours of vicious collisions, but training camp, once six weeks long, is now a three-week summer exercise in getting players prepared, as safely as possible, for the physical rigor that awaits them. Eagles safety Nate Allen, a four-year veteran, likes it that way. He said that by the time a player reaches the N.F.L., he needs practice at tackling tactics, but not actual tackling. That can be reserved for games. “You just have to flip that switch,” Allen said. “And we’ve all been playing long enough to know how to do that.” Some N.F.L. coaches, like the Jets’ Rex Ryan, decide on the level of live contact by feel; it depends how each training camp develops. On Wednesday, Ryan said he had overseen camps where tackling was prohibited throughout. Other times, he said, “you want to see the cream rise to the top,” adding, “You put it out there, put the ball on the ground and say, ‘Let’s have at it.’ ”
sports/football,As of Wednesday, the Jets had not tackled in practice. For all the measured civility and protective deference now routine at N.F.L. training camps, some of the fundamental instincts of the sport still emerge. On Tuesday at Giants camp, another prohibited activity — shoving and fighting after a play is over — occurred between the 300-pound linemen Eric Herman and Marvin Austin. The scuffle was quickly broken up, but not before teammates boisterously hooted and hollered, as if recognizing that some level of aggression was inevitably going to surface under the hot sun. That notion was quickly smothered by Coughlin, the Giants’ coach. “There’s no place for that,” he barked. “Somebody could get hurt.”
sports,In Ray Rice Case, N.F.L. Chose Not to Ask Many Questions - The New York Times An investigation into how the N.F.L. handled a domestic abuse case involving the former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice determined that the league was aware of the nature of the altercation but chose not to aggressively pursue additional information. Robert S. Mueller III, the former F.B.I. director chosen by the N.F.L. to determine how the league handled its investigation of the Rice case, released his findings Thursday. The inquiry found that the N.F.L. and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, did not possess and had not seen a video that showed Mr. Rice punching his fiancée, Janay Palmer, in an elevator before Mr. Goodell’s suspension of Mr. Rice for two games in July. But the league made little effort to pursue the case even after it “possessed substantial information suggesting a serious event had occurred inside the elevator,” the report said. The Ravens had received information about the video before the two-game suspension but did not share it with the league, the report said. The league had seen a video taken from outside the elevator, which was located in an Atlantic City hotel, that showed Mr. Rice dragging an unconscious Ms. Palmer from the elevator, the report said. The next day the league received a copy of a complaint summons, written by officers who had seen the in-elevator video, that charged Mr. Rice with striking Ms. Palmer with his hand, rendering her unconscious. By June 6, the N.F.L. had a copy of the grand jury indictment that said Rice “did recklessly cause significant bodily injury” to Ms. Palmer.
sports,Only after the video from inside the elevator was made public months later — and the N.F.L. came under intense criticism — did Mr. Goodell suspend Mr. Rice indefinitely, a decision that touched off an even wider debate about the league’s disciplinary policies. “This was a wake-up call for all of us,” said John Mara, the co-owner of the Giants who, along with Art Rooney II of the Pittsburgh Steelers, was Mr. Mueller’s liaison at the league. The report was released four months after TMZ, a celebrity gossip website, published the video, which set off a ferocious backlash against the N.F.L. for its handling of domestic violence cases and prompted calls for Mr. Goodell’s resignation. The furor quickly turned into the biggest crisis of Mr. Goodell’s eight-year tenure and has played out through the season as other players, including Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy, were named in abuse cases. Mr. Rice, who appealed his indefinite suspension, has since been reinstated by an arbitrator, who called the penalty “arbitrary” and in conflict with the facts of the case. He has not been signed by a team. Soon after the video was published, Mr. Goodell said on television that he had not seen it when he decided, two months before, to suspend Mr. Rice for two games. Mr. Goodell said the video was inconsistent with what Mr. Rice had told him and Mr. Rice was suspended indefinitely as a result.
sports,Mr. Goodell has said he did not know the full extent of the altercation captured on the video. Mr. Mueller’s report said that the league was aware of the magnitude of the encounter but that it still agreed to a light punishment for Mr. Rice. Skepticism about Mr. Goodell’s explanation grew and the integrity of the league was being questioned. To quell the public’s unrest, the N.F.L. asked Mr. Mueller to review the league’s investigation. Mr. Mueller has had full access to N.F.L. officials, computers and other information. He and his team interviewed more than 200 people and looked specifically for phone calls made from N.F.L. offices to numbers in New Jersey, which is where law enforcement investigators were located. In a statement, Mr. Mara and Mr. Rooney expressed relief that Mr. Mueller’s investigation found that the N.F.L. had not received the video, as the commissioner contended from the outset. But they also said “we were slow to react, and in the case of Ray Rice, the original punishment was insufficient” and that the “the steps taken by the N.F.L. to investigate this matter were inadequate.” An enhanced personal conduct policy recently instituted by the N.F.L., they said, should help the league avoid similar pitfalls in the future. “This matter has tarnished the reputation of the N.F.L. due to our failure to hand out proper punishments,” they said.
sports,Mr. Mueller’s finding that Mr. Goodell did not see the in-elevator video was not entirely surprising. During Mr. Rice’s appeal, Barbara Jones, a former federal judge who served as arbitrator, wrote that while the N.F.L. was aware of the video, the league never requested a copy of it, and therefore Mr. Goodell had never seen it. Mr. Mueller, however, detailed the league’s missteps in its handling of the case. After the Rice scandal exploded in mid-February into what John Raucci, the N.F.L.’s director of investigative services, termed “an Internet feeding frenzy,” the league asked James Buckley, a private investigator and former police detective who has worked with the N.F.L. since 1999, to look into the case, the report said. A series of emails between Mr. Raucci and Mr. Buckley revealed how the N.F.L.’s investigative department was thinking about the altercation and how to best gather information. For example, Mr. Raucci wrote to Mr. Buckley on Feb. 20 that he had “never heard” of a casino not having elevator cameras. He continued: “Separate and apart we have heard from a source, with no attribution, the interior camera shows RR striking his fiancé, more than once, above the shoulders, after she knocked off his hat.” “RR” referred to Ray Rice. Mr. Buckley did not follow up with the casino about the in-elevator video, the report said, but he did confirm the existence of cameras with a source. In other emails, Mr. Raucci asked Mr. Buckley to find out if the incident included “mutual pushing and shoving vs. cold-cocks her and knocks her unconscious.”
sports,“Between us DV” — or domestic violence — “is DV and if the Commissioner is going to come down hard on the guy he should do so; I don’t care who started the incident,” Mr. Raucci wrote. Meanwhile, the Ravens received a “detailed description of the in-elevator video” by phone from an Atlantic City police lieutenant in late February. Those details, the report said, were not volunteered to the league. Mr. Buckley’s work for the N.F.L. between March and May amounted to a passive monitoring of developments. “He did not perform any additional investigative steps, nor was he instructed by the league to seek additional information,” the report found. In late May, as Mr. Goodell prepared for a disciplinary hearing with Rice, Jeffrey Miller, the N.F.L.’s head of security, asked Mr. Raucci in an email, “Have we provided as clear a picture as possible for Commissioner Goodell to make an appropriate decision here?” He added, “Were we able to see video from inside the elevator as to him striking her?” Mr. Raucci asked Mr. Buckley to speak with a lead detective in Atlantic City, but he was not optimistic. “The Atlantic City police are an extremely closed organization, and they seldom, if ever, cooperate with us,” Mr. Raucci wrote to Mr. Miller. By that point, Mr. Rice had agreed to enter a diversion program to postpone any criminal proceedings.
sports,In the wake of the scandal, Mr. Goodell has strengthened the league’s personal conduct policy to include penalties for a wider range of violent offenses. The N.F.L. will expand the use of paid leave for players facing legal problems. Mr. Goodell will also appoint a special counselor to mete out penalties, a job he used to handle. He will, however, continue to hear appeals. “We have all learned a great deal in the past months,” Mr. Goodell said in a statement. Mr. Mara and Mr. Rooney said Mr. Goodell had the full support of the owners. Yet like so much in the Rice case, even the choice of Mr. Mueller created controversy. A former F.B.I. chief who served for 12 years under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Mr. Mueller now works at a Washington law firm that has done work for the N.F.L. Robert Boland, who teaches sports law at New York University, said the report did nothing to dispel the perception that Mr. Mueller had a conflict of interest. He said that the N.F.L.’s insistence on continuing to investigate player misconduct could lead to other controversies in the future. “This could blow up again on the N.F.L.,” he said.

business/media,Megyn Kelly Is Ready for Her Morning Closeup - The New York Times Though Megyn Kelly has offered few specifics about what her NBC morning show will be like, she is happy to try a few analogies. “If a news show and a talk show had a baby, that’s us,” she said of “Megyn Kelly Today,” which starts Monday, in an interview from her fifth-floor corner office at Rockefeller Plaza. “It’s newsy, and it’s talky.” Ms. Kelly, the former Fox News prime-time host, then compared her 9 a.m. show to a cocktail. “Hoda and Kathie Lee love wine,” she said, referring to NBC’s 10 a.m. hosts, Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, who are indeed no strangers to wine. “The ‘Today’ show is mostly coffee. I would say if you had to put a drink on my show, it would be a mimosa. There’s stuff that’s a little naughty. Stuff in there that’s good for you. Some stuff in there that’s fun and sweet. “But,” she continued with the following italics certainly emphasized, “with some effervescence.” The question is, who’s buying? The premiere of the much-anticipated morning talk show effectively begins NBC’s Great Megyn Kelly Experiment. The daily show will be part of the ultra-lucrative “Today” franchise and one that many people in the TV news world are convinced will not work.
business/media,There are reasons for this: Many TV stars before Ms. Kelly — Katie Couric, Jane Pauley and Anderson Cooper among them — have taken a stab at solo daytime talk shows and failed; Ms. Kelly’s Sunday evening show courted controversy and generated middling ratings; her competition, Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest’s “Live,” is formidable; daytime audiences are significantly more diverse and female-driven than the audience for her Fox News show; and, well, people in the television industry like to sharpen their knives when a big personality tries something new. A recent Vanity Fair article was headlined “Has Megyn Kelly’s Star Already Been Eclipsed?” But Ms. Kelly does not care about the swell of skepticism, certainly not after weathering an election in which she found herself for a time as the No. 1 foil of the man who would become president. “I don’t feel this is a risky proposition, because I know myself and know what I can do,” she said. “And I know that I’m about to launch the show that I was born to do. This is what I was meant to do.” Ms. Kelly, 46, did provide some details about the show. She said she did not plan to talk all that much about politics. Her show will have a mix of celebrity guests — Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, and the casts of “This Is Us” and “Will & Grace” will be on during her first week — along with segments dedicated to what she described as “regular people.” There will be a studio audience of about 150 people.
business/media,Ms. Kelly said she opened a rehearsal show on Wednesday by touching on the earthquake in Mexico City and the hurricane in Puerto Rico before quickly moving on to discuss the open letter that Serena Williams wrote to her mother, which has gone viral. In a recent promo for the show, Ms. Kelly said she hoped NBC’s new 9 a.m. hour would be “fun and uplifting and empowering — that makes people feel fists in the air at the end of it.” Her show on Fox News often felt more like a fist to the face. Ms. Kelly rose to fame — in conservative and liberal circles alike — for her withering cross-examinations of her guests. Her 9 p.m. show was No. 1 in the time slot. But she suggested that the job, toward the end, wasn’t bringing her “joy” anymore. (Over the course of a 40-minute interview, she said “joy,” “joyful” or “joyous” nine times.) Still, Fox News was prepared to pay her more than $20 million a year for the job she wasn’t born to do. NBC also made an impressive offer, somewhere north of $15 million. “If I had sat there saying, ‘I have job security here at Fox News, they’re not going to fire me, they’re going to pay me very well,’ that would have been a decision based on fear,” she said. “Fear of the unknown, fear of failure. And that’s an unhealthy place from which to make any decision.”
business/media,Though she had a Sunday newsmagazine show in the summer (and that will return next spring, she said), the centerpiece of her NBC deal is the morning show. Her pivot to the daytime format feels like a reboot after years in the political maelstrom, though she will not call it that. “I think it’s the presentation of the whole me,” Ms. Kelly said. “It’s not like I am changing. I’m just sharing more of who I am. My friends and my family would say, ‘You’re going to see the Megyn we know.’ For me, it truly is all about pursuing more joy. That’s the reason we are here.” On a recent appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” she got a crash course on what her new life will look like: dancing in the stands, donning a sumo wrestler fat suit, cooking. Ms. DeGeneres is good at producing laughs from her audience. “Megyn Kelly Today” has pledged to do the same. “Our viewers at 9 want to be informed, they want to be inspired, they want to laugh,” said Jackie Levin, the executive producer of the show and a “Today” veteran. “I think most importantly people want to laugh a little bit more. That’s what we hope to do.” The competition will be stiff. In the most recent weekly ratings, “Live With Kelly and Ryan” averaged three million viewers, its best viewership in months. And that celebrity-driven morning show has no shortage of stars in the coming weeks, including Harrison Ford, Viola Davis and Kate Winslet.
business/media,Ms. Kelly acknowledged that ratings were significant (“I understand that this is still a business and the show doesn’t get to stay on the air if it doesn’t rate”) but said she wouldn’t be paying attention to them the way she did with her top-rated Fox News show. After all, she has her dream job now. And why exactly is this her dream job? “It’s because I am a person who is searching,” she said. “And always has been. I am searching for my joy and more love and more wellness. Always have been. Finally my job is going to align with my soul, with my heart, with my reason for being. It’s not going to just be a paycheck because it happens to be something I do well.”
us,Chicago to Expand Use of Police Body Cameras - The New York Times CHICAGO —  Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced on Sunday that the city would soon increase the number of police officers wearing video cameras, an expansion of a pilot program started in January in one police district. The announcement came five days after Chicago officials released video from a police dashboard camera of a white police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, even after he had fallen to the ground. Since the video’s release, protesters have held demonstrations almost daily, complaining, in part, that Mr. Emanuel and other city leaders fought for months to keep the graphic video from becoming public, and released it only after a county judge ordered them to do so. The officer, Jason Van Dyke, was charged with murder in the death of the teenager, Laquan McDonald, but critics have pointedly noted that the charges came more than a year later, and only after it was clear that the videotape would be made public. “Sixteen shots and a cover-up!” marchers chanted on Friday as they blocked store doors along gleaming North Michigan Avenue on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. On Saturday, the protests continued, the Chicago police said, and four people were arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing traffic and reckless conduct.
us,“Improving public safety and making Chicago a safer city has been one of my highest priorities,” Mr. Emanuel said in a statement on Sunday about the police body cameras. “Expanding this successful program into one-third of the city will help enhance transparency and credibility as well as strengthen the fabric of trust that is vital between police and the community.” Cities across the nation have been debating the benefits of requiring small, body-worn cameras on police officers, particularly over the past year as protests have mounted over the treatment of black people by the police and as confrontations captured on videotape in places like New York and North Charleston, S.C., have stirred outrage. Since early this year, Chicago has been testing 30 such cameras in one police district. Used to track routine calls, investigatory stops, traffic stops and evidence collection, the cameras have captured more than 745 hours of footage and more than 4,600 videos, city officials said. The city said it now planned to expand the program to more neighborhoods, with 1,200 to 1,400 new cameras by mid-2016. The expansion will be paid for with a $1.1 million grant from the Justice Department and $1.1 million in city funds. Garry F. McCarthy, Chicago’s police superintendent, said the body cameras had been beneficial. “In addition to protecting police officers and citizens, cameras have been shown to reduce citizen complaints against police and are great tools for evidence gathering and training as they allow us to learn from actual encounters with the public,” Mr. McCarthy said.

world/europe,U.S. Will Accept More Refugees as Crisis Grows - The New York Times BERLIN —  The Obama administration will increase the number of worldwide refugees the United States accepts each year to 100,000 by 2017, a significant increase over the current annual cap of 70,000, Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday. “This step that I am announcing today, I believe, is in keeping with the best tradition of America as a land of second chances and a beacon of hope,” Mr. Kerry said, adding that it “will be accompanied by additional financial contributions” for the relief effort. The American move, announced after Mr. Kerry held talks in Berlin with his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, still falls far short of the global demand for resettlement from people who continue to flee turmoil in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries. “This kind of piecemeal, incremental approach is simply not enough to effectively address this crisis,” said Eleanor Acer, director of the refugee protection program at Human Rights First, an advocacy group that has been pressing the United States to take 100,000 Syrians alone next year. “This minimal increase for next year is certainly not a strong response to the largest refugee crisis since World War II.” Four million Syrians have fled to other countries, and hundreds of thousands of others from the Middle East and Africa have been pouring into Europe. Mr. Kerry said the United States would explore ways to increase the overall limit of refugees beyond 100,000, while carrying out background checks to ensure that their numbers are not infiltrated by terrorists.
world/europe,“We still need to do more, and we understand that,” Mr. Kerry said at a news conference with Mr. Steinmeier. Under the new plan, the limit on annual refugee visas would be increased to 85,000 in 2016. The cap would then rise to 100,000 the following year. The United States has taken in only about 1,500 Syrian refugees since the start of the conflict there more than four years ago. American officials said that the Syrians accepted in the next year would come from a United Nations list of about 18,000 refugees. The three largest groups of refugees admitted last year were from Iraq, Somalia and Bhutan. Syrians were at the bottom of the list of nationalities. Refugees are people who have fled their homes to escape war or persecution (and can prove it), while migrants more generally may be relocating for economic reasons. In their meeting, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Steinmeier also focused on ways to end the war in Syria, where 250,000 people have died and 12 million have fled their homes in the past four and a half years. In addition, Germany and the United States will try to rally support next week at the United Nations General Assembly for a significant increase in aid to United Nations refugee camps in the countries neighboring Syria, Mr. Steinmeier said.
world/europe,The American response is unlikely to relieve much of the pressure on European countries, particularly Germany, which remains the most desirable destination for most of the migrants. Other efforts to address the crisis, such as agreeing to distribute migrants equitably among European Union members, have foundered so far, and in the absence of a unified and effective policy, the migrants have been left to find their own way across the Continent. Germany recently has been under pressure from a seemingly unstoppable influx of migrants, and it reinstated border checks a week ago to better manage the crowds. The flow from Austria slowed over the weekend to less than 2,000 registered arrivals each day, according to Lars Rebel, a spokesman for the German federal police. But Austria received about 20,000 newcomers over the weekend on its eastern border with Hungary. Most “still want to go to Germany, their great goal, their great dream, their great vision,” said Alexander Marakovits, a spokesman for Austria’s Interior Ministry in Vienna. At least 10,000 arrived or passed through Sunday at the small Austrian village of Nickelsdorf, a city in the state of Burgenland near the border with Hungary that links Budapest to the east and Vienna to the west, Mr. Marakovits said. The main highway linking the two cities was closed amid concerns that crowds of refugees would spill into traffic. Although everyone insisted the flow was manageable, the director of the state’s police, Hans Peter Doskozil, hinted at the strain.
world/europe,“In the worst case, if there is no shelter, then the buses can go on the highway and make a kind of sightseeing tour,” Mr. Doskozil told the Austria Press Agency, “as crazy as that sounds. “But they must drive away, so that the others see something is happening,” he added. “Otherwise you can’t hold the crowd back anymore.” Gerry Foitik, head of the Austrian Red Cross, said his volunteers would probably manage to accommodate most migrants somewhere in Austria on Sunday night. But he said about 5,000 might remain in and around Nickelsdorf. Mr. Kerry met with Mr. Steinmeier in Berlin at Villa Börsig, a palatial German guesthouse overlooking a lake. Later they met with a small group of Syrian refugees, who asked not to be identified by journalists out of concern for friends or relatives still in Syria. The Syrians, asked by Mr. Kerry why the surge of migrants had been so great in recent weeks, said they had despaired of being able to return home and that life in refugee camps was becoming harder as food rations were cut back. “The reason people are coming now is because they gave up hope completely,” one woman said. One man asked: “Are not five years enough for the international community to intervene, especially the United States?” Asked at his news conference why the United States could not accept more Syrians more quickly, Mr. Kerry said that budget constraints and vetting requirements established after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks limited the scope of the response.
world/europe,“We are doing what we know we can manage immediately,” he said. But he did not rule out the possibility that more might eventually be done. Along the migrant trail, those who had appeared boxed in on Friday — stranded in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary — somehow managed to continue their trek. With help from the Serbian authorities, who made no secret of their policy of pushing them through as fast as possible, most of the migrants who had been thwarted at the Hungarian border made their way west into Croatia. From there, some continued toward Slovenia, where the authorities said around 2,500 had crossed the border by Sunday morning; the Croatians took a larger number to the Hungarian border in the northeast. In Hungary, angry officials, who have been struggling to extend a razor-wire fence at the Serbian border to include the Croatian frontier, received the arrivals, packed them on trains and buses and moved them quickly to the Austrian line. The authorities there were allowing them to enter — 5,000 on Saturday alone. The authorities in Slovenia, meanwhile, were halting migrants at the border with Croatia to the south and allowing them to pass in small groups, taken by bus from border crossings at Obrezje and Rigonce to several locations around the country. By Sunday morning, the crowds had diminished, with only about 300 people waiting at the huge Obrezje crossing, and only about half as many in Rigonce. Those who continued to straggle toward the border from deeper inside Croatia were simply allowed through by the Croatian authorities, leaving it up to the Slovenians to stop and process them.
world/europe,The Slovenians took the migrants, one busload at a time, to a processing center in Brezice, a few miles from the border. There, they were registered but not fingerprinted. Slovenia is a member of the European Union, as is Croatia, but unlike Croatia it also is part of the Schengen accord, which allows passport-free travel but encourages strong external borders. Illustrating how hard it is to keep the refugees from their main goal — Germany — only seven migrants had requested asylum in Slovenia by Sunday. The rest were taken to six refugee centers around the country. From there, many simply decided to make their own way north toward the Austrian line, where a few hundred had crossed by Sunday morning.
weekinreview,Obama: A Giant-Killer, Feeling His Oats - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Is this it, then? He hath slain the health-care Goliath. Does that mean, a year and a half into the job, that President Obama has acquired the political savvy and tactical confidence to take on other juggernauts? Amidst all the euphoria at the White House last week, that question hovered; and not just in Washington. More than a dozen foreign leaders called to congratulate Mr. Obama on his historic achievement. Editorial pages around the world lauded Mr. Obama — a British magazine swooned that he could perhaps “out achieve” even Franklin Roosevelt. A Financial Times cartoon depicted Mr. Obama as Superman. But, at the risk of killing the White House buzz, remember President Bush’s Mission Accomplished appearance on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln? Political fortunes can turn quickly, especially since, in Mr. Obama’s case, he still has another two and a half years to go in his first term — plenty of time for other things to go wrong that could stain his presidency. The trick now for Mr. Obama, presidential scholars say, will be to turn the lessons he has learned in the health care fight to the other big, intractable issues that loom, from climate change to unemployment, to Iran, and even to the ultimate behemoth that has bedeviled American presidents since 1967: Middle East peace. We’ll come back to that in a second.
weekinreview,Mr. Obama could retire into the history books, many presidential scholars say, on the health care achievement alone. But there is a swagger emanating from the White House that suggests he may now have acquired a liking for the benefits of sticking his neck out to lead. Just days after the health vote, Mr. Obama completed a landmark arms control accord with Russia that had eluded negotiators for months. The Start agreement took far more time to reach than Mr. Obama had expected, exceeding the deadline by four months. But in the end, Russia backed down on the last contentious point. That was after Mr. Obama refused to yield to Russian demands on missile defense, even though he risked missing another looming deadline, the nuclear security summit he will host in April. “Had Obama lost the health care vote, he would have been politically damaged,” said David Rothkopf, a Clinton administration official now who writes on foreign policy. “And that would have had an effect on everything else. But the major transformational consequence of winning isn’t a political boost, but the fact that he is now learning on the job. The message is that he is starting to come of age as a leader.” How Mr. Obama applies the lessons of health care to other issues will be a big part of determining his success, many presidential historians say. Tenacity isn’t necessarily enough; there has to be patience and a willingness, at some point, to draw a line in the sand.
weekinreview,After the fractious Copenhagen climate change summit in December, Mr. Obama sounded much more willing to accept compromise and the imperfect. After pushing and prodding, he reached a deal with China, India, Brazil and South Africa that codified commitments by those countries to act on their own to tackle global warming. But the agreement failed to set a 2010 goal for reaching a binding international treaty to seal the provisions of the accord. Nor did it commit either the industrialized or the developing nations to firm targets for mid-  or long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. For Mr. Obama, it was, at best, the equivalent of hitting a single in baseball. He defended the pact as a flawed but essential step forward, saying he was “making the best of the situation that you’re in at this point, and then continually trying to improve and make progress from there.” Fast forward three months to Friday, post health-care victory, as Mr. Obama took his second victory lap of the week, on the Russian arms control agreement, the equivalent of a double in baseball. “It took patience, it took perseverance,” Mr. Obama said. “But we never gave up.” Nor, this week, did Mr. Obama settle for a smaller compromise with Israel. Instead, he shocked even the most hardened Middle East peace negotiators by swinging for the fence, demanding of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a firm commitment to rein in settlement construction in East Jerusalem.
weekinreview,The stakes on this issue are sky-high. Most Middle East experts say there can be no final Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement without resolving Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition views the city, east and west, as the undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people, in which they can build where they want. The Palestinians and supporters throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds see East Jerusalem as holy, and rightfully under Palestinian sovereignty. In refusing last week to settle for Mr. Netanyahu’s compromise offers, including restrictions on Israeli troop activities in the West Bank, the freeing of Palestinian prisoners and further efforts to bolster the Palestinian economy, Mr. Obama sent Mr. Netanyahu back to Israel empty-handed, lengthening the deepest crisis between the two allies in years. The Israeli press has written that Mr. Netanyahu was ambushed, Mr. Obama has come under fire from the pro-Israel lobby in Washington and from Republican lawmakers. Even some Democrats have privately questioned whether he has gone too far. It no doubt will be months, if not years, before anyone will know how the Israel standoff will end. But Mr. Obama, in pushing Mr. Netanyahu, is forcing the Israeli prime minister into a stark choice, argues Martin Indyk, a former United States ambassador to Israel and the vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution: “He’s pushing the issue for Bibi, and forcing him to answer this question: Do you want to be Bibi, the politician?” Mr. Indyk said, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname.

nyregion,Michel Faulkner, Harlem Minister, Announces G.O.P. Bid to Unseat Mayor de Blasio - The New York Times With Mayor Bill de Blasio’s poll numbers in a prolonged slump, Republican leaders have vowed to put up a strong challenger in 2017. But to compete in strongly liberal New York City, Republicans would most likely need either a candidate of some political celebrity to challenge the Democratic mayor, or at least someone with vast personal wealth to spend on a campaign. Michel J. Faulkner does not fall into either category. On Monday, Mr. Faulkner, a Harlem minister who once played football for the New York Jets, began what he described as a marathonlike campaign to unseat Mr. de Blasio, broadly criticizing the mayor’s leadership style and management of the police. Mr. Faulkner, a Republican, said it was essential to announce his long-shot bid more than two years before the 2017 election. Defeating Mr. de Blasio, he said, would require a full-scale political movement rather than a conventional campaign. Standing at a busy intersection north of Times Square, periodically drowned out by the noise of construction and traffic, Mr. Faulkner said Mr. de Blasio had proved to be a divisive leader without the charisma to lead a great city. “I don’t think he really understands the core of who we are as a city — the greatness, the history of this city,” Mr. Faulkner said in an interview. “That’s what I want to be able to tap into.”
nyregion,A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on Mr. Faulkner’s criticism of the mayor. At an unrelated event on Monday, the mayor shrugged off the Republican’s announcement. “The more the merrier,” Mr. de Blasio said of his aspiring challengers. “I feel very good about what I have to say to the people of this city over the next two years.” Mr. Faulkner has sought political office before, challenging Representative Charles B. Rangel in the 2010 election. He won about 10 percent of the vote in an overwhelmingly Democratic district. Mr. Faulkner has broadcast his intention to run for mayor for months. On Monday, he said that he had already begun knocking on doors in neighborhoods like Bensonhurst and Sunset Park in Brooklyn. But Mr. Faulkner also acknowledged that his mayoral bid was very much a work in progress. The pastor said he had yet to speak with either of the city’s last two Republican mayors, Michael R. Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani, about his campaign. Queried about his ideas for affordable housing, Mr. Faulkner said he would have more specific policy proposals within a year. Although Republicans intend to back a strong candidate against Mr. de Blasio, the party does not have a deep bench. Speculation so far has focused on Raymond W. Kelly, who was the police commissioner under Mayor Bloomberg, and Eva S. Moskowitz, the charter school executive who was previously elected to office as a Democrat, but has clashed bitterly with Mr. de Blasio over education policy.
nyregion,Mr. Faulkner is a social conservative who has opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage. (Asked about his views on same-sex marriage on Monday, Mr. Faulkner said that the mayor of New York City had no role in the issue.) Still, clad in a pinstriped suit with a blue ribbon pinned to his chest — to show support for the police, he said — Mr. Faulkner said he had the force of personality and the right philosophy of government to lead New York. Mr. Faulkner, who served on a task force on police relations under Mayor Giuliani, faulted Mr. de Blasio for failing to reassure police officers that he “has their back,” and for alienating the business community. Mr. Faulkner pledged that he would get along better with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is a Democrat, than Mr. de Blasio has. The two Democratic leaders have clashed, with increasingly open hostility. “This governor has been pretty independent of his party,” Mr. Faulkner said. “I have no doubt that I will have a much better relationship, a working relationship, with this governor.” And if Mr. Faulkner were to advance to a debate with Mr. de Blasio, he would at least be able to challenge the mayor eye-to-eye: At 6-foot-4, Mr. Faulkner is, at most, only one or two inches shorter than Mr. de Blasio.
sports/tennis,U.S. Open Today: Novak Djokovic Makes Brief Court Appearance - The New York Times Top-ranked Novak Djokovic rarely misses the round of 16 at a Grand Slam tournament, but he has never gotten there as easily as he did in this United States Open. Djokovic has not played a full match since Monday night. He received a walkover in the second round because his opponent, Jiri Vesely, had a forearm injury. He got another break Friday when his third-round opponent, Mikhail Youzhny, retired with a left hamstring strain six games into their match. “This particular situation I never had in my Grand Slam career,” Djokovic said after practicing for an hour in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic, who is recovering from a wrist injury, said it was good to have some days off and shorter matches. But spending so little time on court is not ideal either. “As you are approaching second week of the Grand Slam, you want to have match play and you want to have time spent on center court before you face one of the top players,” he said. Djokovic will not have to face a top player in the next round. His opponent will be the Briton Kyle Edmund, ranked 84th in the world, who upended 20th-seeded John Isner, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (5). Edmund, 21, is enjoying the finest Grand Slam tournament of his young career. He had won only two matches in eight Grand Slam singles appearances coming into the Open, but he knocked out 13th-seeded Richard Gasquet in the first round before taking out Isner.
sports/tennis,“These are the situations you want to be in, what you dream about, reaching the fourth round of a Slam now, getting the opportunity to play the world No. 1,” Edmund said. Seventh-seeded Marin Cilic, the 2014 champion, bombed five aces in his first three service games against No. 26 Jack Sock, and all his ducks appeared to be in a row. But then Cilic’s forehand, which has a history of being his more erratic groundstroke wing, coughed up three consecutive errors at 3-3 in the opening set, and he effectively broke himself. Sock took full advantage, defeating Cilic, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, in surprising ease in just over 90 minutes to move through to the fourth round of the tournament for the first time. Sock went after Cilic’s backhand, forcing 26 costly errors. Sock, by comparison, had only 12 backhand forced errors from what is considered his weaker side. Sock overwhelmed Cilic in the all-important rallies of up to four shots. Sock forged a 73-44 advantage, which paved the way to victory as 80 percent of points were zero to four shots. Developing the point was not on the mind of either player this afternoon. Sock never faced a break point for the match, while converting four of six on Cilic’s serve. Cilic has averaged making 56 percent of his first serves this season, which is already quite low, but he managed to put in only 49 percent against Sock.
sports/tennis,Sock won the first point when serving in 13 of 14 service games, while Cilic won only 9 of 14. In the five games, Cilic lost the opening point, he was broken in three of them. In the second set, Cilic lost his serve to love at 1-1, when Sock converted break point with a stunning backhand return winner down the line. In the third set, Cilic was broken at 3-4, with three backhand errors heavily contributing to the downfall. Overall, Sock won an impressive 60 percent (42 of 70) of his baseline points, while Cilic could manage only 35 percent (23 of 45). — CRAIG O’SHANNESSY Read a complete article on the match here.  Many times in her young career, Madison Keys has been the inexperienced player on the court, the one challenging the veteran, battling nervous moments to try to make a breakthrough. But Friday, Keys, 21, was the veteran for a change. Her 18-year-old opponent, Naomi Osaka, was up by two breaks in the deciding third set and served for the match two times. She was broken both times. After the second break, Osaka was in tears. But Keys seized the opening, taking the third set in a tiebreaker to win the match, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (3). Keys, who has her highest seeding in a Grand Slam event, at No. 8, has now played two of the most memorable matches of this tournament. She played the last match at Ashe Stadium on opening night, winning a 2-hour-25-minute marathon against Alison Riske that ended at 1:48 a.m.

He lost to Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, 6-3, 7-6 (4), 1-6, 6-1. Baghdatis, 31, had not advanced to the fourth round of a major since the Australian Open in 2009. Baghdatis’s next opponent is 10th-seeded Gaël Monfils. ■ The No. 13 seed Johanna Konta defeated No. 24 Belinda Bencic, 6-2, 6-1, to reach the fourth round of the Open for the second year in a row.

Shocking yellow images have popped up across the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. They are not a flowery sign of late spring or early autumn, but the trend of neon yellow tennis gear is reaching its peak. Nike-sponsored players have been swimming in neon yellow at this year’s United States Open, and the color can be spotted across the stands on fans, too. The color has been popular in tennis for a few years, but there has been nothing quite like the sight of Juan Martín del Potro, standing 6 feet 6 inches, and dressed in headband, shirt, wristbands, the top half of his shorts, socks and shoes, all in neon yellow. The shocking hue bears a striking resemblance to another bright yellow object: the official United States Open tennis ball. That can create a trick for photographers, as the ball occasionally disappears into players’ shirts for a fraction of a second just as photographers click their shutters. But to players, there is no such illusion. “I feel like at this point, you know, we should all know how to watch the ball,” Taylor Townsend, 20, said.

us,‘I Want This to Get Over’: After Congressional Shooting, Complex Grief for a Gunman’s Widow - The New York Times BELLEVILLE, Ill. — He flung dishes at his wife, roared at the television, erupted during an outing at a local brewery. Suzanne Hodgkinson became so concerned with her husband’s growing anger that she wrote to his doctor asking for help. Now, the wife of the man who opened fire on a congressional baseball team in June wonders what more she could have done. “I get up every morning feeling guilty because I didn’t stop it,” Ms. Hodgkinson said Wednesday at her home in Belleville, where the blinds are drawn tight and photographs of her husband adorn a living room wall. It was her first sit-down interview with a reporter since her husband, James Thomas Hodgkinson, attacked a Republican congressional baseball team practice in Alexandria, Va., wounding Representative Steve Scalise and three other people before the authorities killed him. (Mr. Scalise remains hospitalized in fair condition.) Ms. Hodgkinson continued, “I wake up with hot sweats, thinking: ‘You should have known. You should have known.’” To be the spouse, or the parent, or the child of someone who commits a mass shooting is to enter a strange club whose members are envied by no one and reviled by many. Rites of passage include hate mail, death threats and the vicious thoughts that haunt them at night. That they should have seen it coming. That they could have done something. That they are alone.
us,And then there is the question of how to mourn. How to dispose of a body that everyone else wants to forget. On Tuesday, Ms. Hodgkinson, 65, received an email at her job at an accountant’s office on Main Street, asking her to identify the body. A formality. When she opened the attachment, her husband’s swollen face stared back at her. “That’s Tom,” she said she had written back, before hitting delete. She would like to deal with Mr. Hodgkinson’s remains as quickly and quietly as possible, she said. He was not a bad man at his core, she believes. They married in 1984. When they met, he was happy, singing in her ear at a grocery store. Later, they took in some 35 foster children and adopted two. But in the late 1990s, after a long illness, he took a turn, she said. His rage came more suddenly. Now she wants it all to go away. She has asked a funeral home run by a friend to cremate Mr. Hodgkinson’s body. After that, she may scatter the ashes at home, or bury them in nearby St. Louis. She won’t be informing the public. There will be no ceremony. “Coldhearted as it may be, I’m done,” Ms. Hodgkinson said. “He was not a religious man, and I’m done with this. I want this to get over. I want my granddaughters to be able to go to school in September without this being dredged up.”
us,She paused, then spoke as if Mr. Hodgkinson were sitting on the couch next to her. “You just walked out on me.” The number of mass shootings in the United States has risen sharply in recent years — to an average of 16.4 per year between 2007 and 2013, from 6.4 per year between 2000 and 2006. (These numbers come from the F.B.I. and exclude episodes tied to domestic violence and gangs.) Each of these attacks has left the families of innocent victims awash in pain, with a growing number of Americans roped into the indelible trauma of a sudden, senseless, violent attack. And more and more, communities and individuals are having to wrestle with how to treat the bodies of these perpetrators. Relatives of people who commit mass shootings often choose secret burials in unmarked graves with small or nonexistent ceremonies, designed to keep away critics and vandals. This has not stopped the onslaught of attention and condemnation. Bodies hold symbolic power, said Ann Neumann, a visiting scholar at New York University who studies death, with places of interment often seen as reflections of how society valued a person. Which is why people get so worked up when a major criminal is buried in their backyard. After the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, protesters lined up outside a funeral home that had agreed to accept the body of one of the attackers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, holding signs that urged his family to “Bury the Garbage in the Landfill.” After the attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, relatives of the killers, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, interred their bodies in a cemetery far from their California home after a closer graveyard rejected them.
us,Soon, a city near the cemetery passed an ordinance prohibiting the burial of known terrorists in the area. Someone took a saw to the sign marking the American Islamic Institute of Antelope Valley, which maintains the plots, hacking it to pieces. “I had rocks thrown at me. I was spit on. People shot at me with BB guns,” said Peter Stefan, the funeral director who handled the Tsarnaev burial. It took a week to find a cemetery that would take the remains. Eventually, the bomber’s family washed his body according to Muslim tradition and buried him in a Virginia plot under the cover of night. Mr. Stefan said he had helped bury the bomber “to show society that we are really a few steps ahead of people like this guy.” He added, “We did for him what he probably would never have done for anybody else.” In 1999, after Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people at Columbine High School in a Denver suburb, a handful of people went to a ceremony for Mr. Klebold. He lay in a cardboard coffin surrounded by stuffed animals. At the time, the Rev. Don Marxhausen, who spoke at the ceremony, called the Klebolds “the loneliest people on the planet.” A year after the funeral, he was ousted from his church, amid tension over his involvement with the case. He later said he had done it out of a sense of duty and would do it again. “When your phone rings, you go,” he told The Denver Post.
us,Mr. Klebold’s mother, Sue Klebold, said in a recent interview that a colleague had urged her to have the funeral, arguing that it would help with the grieving process. It did. “When you lose a loved one who has hurt other people, one of the struggles you have is the ability to focus on your sorrow, because your grief is so complicated by all these other things,” she said. She gradually came out of hiding and wrote a memoir. Today, when she is out in public and someone mentions that her name is familiar, she can be open. “I think you’re probably thinking of my son Dylan,” she says, “who was one of the shooters in the Columbine tragedy.” Here, Ms. Hodgkinson is wrestling with the legacy of the man she loved. She denies that he ever assaulted any of their children, which was alleged in decade-old court documents. Neighbors have urged her not to mow the lawn, for fear she’ll be attacked in her yard. A friend takes out her trash, dispersing it around town to evade snoops. When she ventured to the Shop ’N Save alone recently, a white-haired woman — a stranger — approached her in the parking lot and slapped her across the face. “That was O.K.,” Ms. Hodgkinson said. “Get it out, lady. Just don’t pick up a gun and shoot somebody.” She cried all the way home.
us,It was during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mr. Hodgkinson’s Democratic politics boiled into a rage, she said. He sided with Senator Bernie Sanders. When Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Hodgkinson said, her husband went “bananas.” She urged him to take action locally. He said he wanted to go to the top. In March, he left for Washington, saying that he was going to work on tax reform. She figured he would return, she would retire and they would buy a motorcycle “and just go for days on end.” He emailed the family and expressed frustration with Washington’s intransigence. On June 14, she woke to the sounds of her 2-year-old grandson. As she does every morning, she turned on the television and fed her grandson cookies and milk. The anchors were already talking about the shooting, and it briefly occurred to her that her husband might have done it. He had been so angry. Then the reporters mentioned that the attacker had a rifle. She figured it couldn’t be Tom. He had left for Washington with only his pistol.
world/europe,French Parliament Debates Weight Standards for Fashion Models - The New York Times PARIS  — France, which often seems to have style and elegance written into its genetic code, is again confronting one of the dark sides of fashion: the glamorization of too-thin women. The French Parliament is debating legislation that would effectively set minimum weights for women and girls to work as models, a step that supporters of the bill say is necessary to combat the persistence of anorexia. If it becomes law — it is backed by President François Hollande’s Socialist government — modeling agencies and fashion houses that employ models whose body mass index measurements do not meet minimum standards would face criminal penalties. Israel already bans the use of underweight and underage models, while other countries, including Italy and Spain, have weighed legislation similar to the one under consideration in France but for now continue to rely on voluntary pacts with the fashion industry. If France approves the legislation, it would almost certainly raise the debate to a new level, especially in Paris, the spiritual capital of the fashion world. An effort to pass similar provisions in 2008 failed after heavy criticism from the fashion industry. “We can’t resolve it with a law but we can begin a public health policy to prevent and protect and limit the number of those suffering from anorexia,” said Olivier Véran, a neurologist and a member of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament.
world/europe,He is the author of the anti-anorexia provision, which is part of a comprehensive health law being debated in the National Assembly. He estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people in France suffer from anorexia. The proposed legislation would use as its base internationally accepted body mass index standards to determine whether a model was too thin and would set criminal penalties for hiring models who fell below the standards determined by the law. The index suggests that a woman who is 5 feet 7 inches tall should weigh at least 120 pounds. But the final legal standards would be determined by the French health authorities, who could adjust them for factors such as bone size. Violators would have to pay a fine of about $83,000 and serve as many as six months in prison. The struggle over the appearance and health of fashion models is hardly a new one. It became more public in 2006 after the deaths of two models, a Brazilian and a Uruguayan, which set off a spate of voluntary standards in the industry and the effort in some places, including New York, to use healthier looking models. The death in 2010 of a French model and actress, Isabelle Caro, who at one point weighed just 55 pounds, fueled further calls for steps to address anorexia. So far the fashion industry has opposed legislation to address the issue, although a number of designers have spoken out in favor of using “healthy models” and promoting healthful lifestyles.
world/europe,There is no official database of models’ heights and weights, and with regulations against using underweight models on the rise, most models and agencies are close-mouthed about the subject. Many in the industry say, however, that a number of the top models would likely weigh less than the healthy threshold set by the body mass index of about 18 or 18.5. Widely publicized figures for weights of models like Kate Moss at the height of her fashion career indicate she would have had a body mass index of 15 to 16, which was similar to that of Twiggy, a 1960s supermodel. More recent models, such as Naomi Campbell and Gisele Bündchen, are reported to have body mass indexes between 16 and 17. A body mass index of less than 18 does not necessarily mean that someone has an eating disorder. The National Union of Modeling Agencies in France issued a statement saying it was complying with a voluntary charter that discourages the use of anorexic models and that was approved by the government in 2008. The statement also said that an appropriate minimum weight for models had yet to be determined. “Anorexia is a mental illness that cannot be fought by a ‘arithmomania,’ ” the union’s statement said. It called on the fashion world to take a uniform approach internationally and deplored the use of “selectively repressive” measures, referring to those now under consideration. Calls to 10 modeling agencies with offices in Paris found none willing to respond to questions on the issue.
world/europe,Elite, a top international agency, said through the secretary of its spokeswoman in Paris, Celine Rousseau, “We do not wish to comment on this news.” When some international designers have been questioned about the problem, such as Karl Lagerfeld in a 2012 interview, they have denied having ever worked with anorexic models. Even a glance through photos from the recent Fashion Week in Paris reveals many women whose bodies are almost without curves and whose faces have hollows where there should be cheeks. But whether there is a connection between fashion’s images of women and the continuing phenomenon of tens of thousands of primarily but not exclusively young women in Western developed countries suffering from anorexia is hard to determine and unlikely to be halted just by an increase in the weight of models, French psychiatrists said. They recommended an array of steps to attack the problem. “It’s not having a model weigh three kilos more that will resolve the problem,” said Marie Rose Moro, a child psychiatrist and the director of the Maison de Solenn, a residential facility that treats eating disorders and other mental health problems in young people. One kilogram is 2.2 pounds. There is a “transnational sort of tyranny of thinness,” Dr. Moro said, adding that unlike in previous eras, to have a “rounded” shape today is equated with a lack of self-control and with “excess, obesity, poor health.”
world/europe,Marcel Rufo, a psychiatrist with a clinic in Marseille for adolescents with anorexia or other troubles, said he believed that the public was searching for an explanation for children’s pursuit of thinness. He noted the proliferation of posts on blogs and on Twitter promoting the idea that girls should have a space between their thighs when standing with their legs together and that their stomachs should be concave. “Parents, the public authorities, deputies in the National Assembly want to find a cause, something to blame,” Dr. Rufo said. “So, one designates fashion as to blame, but I believe that it is much more complicated than that,” he said.
science,Taking a Second Look at Penguins’ Decline - The New York Times The population of Adélie penguins in Antarctica has declined by 50 percent in recent years, and everyone who has watched a nature movie or television show knows that the reason is the rapidly melting sea ice that has limited the size of their winter habitat. But what everyone knows may be wrong. New research, published online Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the penguins’ real problem is the severe decline in the abundance of Antarctic krill, their main food, a problem affecting the ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins as well. “For the last 30 years, the adults have been able to rear chicks as they always have,” said Wayne Z. Trivelpiece, the lead author. “But the young aren’t coming back. Ninety percent never make it through their first year. They are not finding the food they need.” By the middle of the 20th century, hunting and fishing had nearly eliminated fur seals, whales and some fish. Krill, their favorite prey, flourished, and penguins feasted on the oversupply. In the 1970s and early 1980s the penguins did well on the whole, their numbers varying with the extent of sea ice — Adélie penguins did somewhat better when there was more ice, while chinstraps thrived in warmer winters.
science,Recent warm weather has reduced the area of sea ice, but for the penguins this is a side issue. The real problem is that warmer winters, a recovering whale population and increasing harvests for human use have reduced the quantity of krill. In 2009-10 more than 202,000 tons of krill were taken, up from 51,000 tons in 2002-3. Both Adélie and chinstrap penguins are now suffering, and their future is uncertain. “Maybe we’ve hit the bottom,” said Dr. Trivelpiece, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “But we don’t really know. They’re so dependent on krill that we don’t know how this is going to play out.”

books,Honor His Father - The New York Times AMERICANS are all fugitives and the descendants of fugitives. Even after we arrived and settled into various communities and ghettos, we would remain in place usually no more than a single generation before picking up and moving on, constantly on the search for a sanctuary where we could most truly be ourselves, freed at last from cumbersome antecedents of oppression and persecution, or merely of failure. The lure of the West was the promise of a new beginning, and it is no accident that Americans so rarely remain in place for more than a single generation. I vividly recall my own sense of relief when I first moved from New York City to Los Angeles in the mid-1960's and found myself in a place where no one cared where I had come from or what I had done, but only what I was up to now. It was finally when we became convinced, during the past generation, that the frontiers have been shut down and the old dreams discredited (California is now considered a tarnished wasteland from which the disillusioned are fleeing by the million yearly) that we have begun to look backward, as if to reassure ourselves that we matter and can now make a stand on our heritage, from the ancient civilizations that nourished our forebears. No longer Americans, we are now Native Americans, African Americans, Italian-Americans, Jewish Americans, unequal citizens in a commonwealth of tribal cultures.
books,In "Unto the Sons," Gay Talese has focused his indefatigable reportorial techniques on his own family. By his account, he has spent most of the past 10 years rooting around in his past, interviewing people here and in Europe, reading history, old letters, journals, public documents, and gradually piecing together a huge mosaic of "the quaintly mythified but pragmatic clan of village spiritualists and opportunists who populate my Italian ancestry." If the result is only partly satisfactory as a reading experience, it is not for want of effort. Mr. Talese is the sort of journalist who has never met a fact he didn't like, at least enough to enshrine it in his text. He begins with his own boyhood recollections of growing up during the 1930's and the war years of the early 1940's in Ocean City, a small island community off the southern coast of New Jersey. "I was olive-skinned in a freckle-faced town, and I felt unrelated even to my parents, especially my father, who was indeed a foreigner -- an unusual man in dress and manner, to whom I bore no physical resemblance and with whom I could never identify," he recalls. "Trim and elegant, with wavy dark hair and a small rust-colored moustache, he spoke English with an accent and received letters bearing strange-looking stamps." He also prayed at home to a strange god, "a bearded, brown-robed medieval monk" with an emaciated face, named St. Francis of Paola, who "had cured the crippled and revived the dead" and apparently spent his whole life denying himself pleasure.
books,This father, Joseph Talese, a hard-working tailor who also operated a fur storage vault and a dry-cleaning establishment, then later a dress shop in partnership with his wife, becomes, along with an older first cousin of Joseph's named Antonio Cristiani, the central figure in Mr. Talese's narrative. The women in the tale, in fact, although there are many of them, seem to exist only as supporting players. Mr. Talese describes his own mother, whom he doesn't mention by name in his opening pages, as a "graceful and slender woman" of Italian descent who adored only her husband and hated to be touched by anyone else. "The impression persisted throughout my youth that I was a kind of orphan in the custody of a compatible couple whose way of life was strange and baffling." It's only when he starts to burrow around in his family's history that Mr. Talese begins to understand who he is and where he comes from, piecing together for us an immigrant saga of a familiar sort that is nevertheless interesting, enlightening and occasionally quite moving. Essentially, it's the story of two cousins, Joseph and Antonio, who dream of escaping from their impoverished southern Italian village to a better life in a new world, Antonio to Paris in 1911 and Joseph to the United States in 1920. We've been over this terrain before, but seldom as exhaustively as in Mr. Talese's rendering.
books,The village of Maida, Joseph Talese's hometown, is precariously perched on the toe of the Italian boot. Throughout history it has been overrun, occupied, sacked and exploited by foreign conquerors, including the Piedmontese. Garibaldi, whose Redshirts supposedly liberated the town from the Bourbon monarchy in Naples in 1860 so that it could be integrated into the new Kingdom of Italy, is no hero in Maida. The royal House of Savoy and its northern troops looted the Bourbon treasury, plunging the entire south of the country into an economic depression from which it has never recovered. The only escape from it was to emigrate, which accounts for the millions of southern Italians, including the Taleses, who fled to our shores until we closed the gates after World War I. Mr. Talese is at his best in describing the hard life of those who remained behind and in conveying a powerful sense of the dour fatalism that still dominates the outlook of an entire region. "It was considered bad luck in the village to anticipate happiness," Joseph learned as he was growing up, apprenticed to Antonio's father in the town's only tailor shop. Joseph's own father, Gaetano, had emigrated in the spring of 1888 to America, where he worked in an asbestos factory in Pennsylvania, leaving behind Joseph's mother, another of the so-called white widows, the wives whose husbands emigrated to find work and whose men came home only for short visits, if at all.
books,Joseph grew up in terror of being condemned to the fate of his older brother, Sebastian, who slaved from dawn to night in the rocky soil of Gaetano's brother's farm. This brother, Domenico, spoke in the fierce accents of the cruel south. "Never educate your children beyond yourself," he'd say, quoting an old village aphorism. After causing pain, he'd explain that "people who do not love you . . . make you laugh. People who love you make you cry." Who would not have wanted to escape from such a dark voice and the world it spoke for? At its most successful, Mr. Talese's book reads like a good novel, with a strong narrative thrust and vividly portrayed male characters. As he meticulously reconstructs his family chronicle, a larger dramatic portrait of an entire region and way of life emerges, a society of "pessimists, mystics, people shaped by earthquakes, plagues, and other calamities beyond their control." As Joseph and Antonio plot and struggle to get away, they do so against this backdrop of a "a warm, bright place in the mountains where nobody truly saw the sun," where people were in constant mourning and "the most casual of compliments could be construed as a curse." When the cousins finally do escape and begin to build themselves new lives abroad, they find that they can never shake off this "legacy of broken promises" and that it colors all their relationships and everything they do.
books,The best scenes in "Unto the Sons" are those in which this dichotomy is vividly portrayed, as in the inevitable confrontation that occurs between the author and his father in the narrative's closing pages. Maddened and grief-stricken by his divided loyalties during World War II, when American troops fought a bitter campaign up the Italian boot, Joseph bursts into his son's bedroom to destroy the model American warplanes the boy has spent all of his spare time building. If Mr. Talese had confined himself to telling this story, "Unto the Sons," with its larger implications for all of us, might have succeeded on every level. Unfortunately, he has set himself the task of writing an epic and it persistently derails him. He bloats his text with great chunks of history and undigested research. We are given a blow-by-blow account of Garibaldi's campaign, as recalled by Joseph's teacher in Maida; an essay on Italy's role in World War I and its consequences; a biography of Benito Mussolini and the Fascist movement; a portrait of the town of Ambler, Pa., where Joseph's father worked, and a history of asbestos, its principal product; a meticulously detailed reconstruction of the family history of Dr. Richard V. Mattison, the so-called Asbestos King (Gaetano Talese's employer), back to the 17th century; an entire chapter devoted to the crippled Mrs. Mattison's struggle to build housing for the squirrels living on the Mattison property. Not that this material is entirely irrelevant, but its inclusion in toto is like an infusion of sludge into a brook. Some strong editor should have tried to persuade Mr. Talese to cut and compress.
books,The puffing up of his manuscript has also had an unhappy effect on the author's style. As long as he confines himself to telling the story, Mr. Talese writes with his customary verve and skill. Too often, however, he seems to become aware that he's supposed to be writing an important book of huge implications, which leads him occasionally to sound as if he's declaiming from a battlement. "The inhabitants of Maida . . . were ever aware that they might at any moment be flung into obscurity by a calamitous convulsion" is a typical example of portentous writing early in his narrative. By the end of the book, like Charles de Gaulle and Norman Mailer, he's referring to himself in the third person. Mr. Talese should have trusted his people more and worried less about what posterity would make of his tale.
us/politics,Mike Pence Takes Turn Auditioning for Role as Donald Trump’s Running Mate - The New York Times WESTFIELD, Ind. — Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana came to his vice-presidential audition here on Tuesday night as prepared as a mild-mannered, socially conservative governor could be. He practically shouted his remarks (energy!); he stood ramrod straight in the politician’s uniform of a charcoal suit and blue tie (presidential!); and he went after Hillary Clinton (attack dog!). He even took to Twitter, to fire off some of his best zingers: “Hillary Clinton must NEVER become the President of the United States of America!” he wrote. Left unclear was the ultimate verdict on Mr. Pence from the man who stood just offstage — Donald J. Trump, who arrived here in part to determine if he and Mr. Pence have the rapport to lift a possible Trump-Pence ticket to victory over Mrs. Clinton in November. When Mr. Trump took the stage, introduced to applause by Mr. Pence, the jury was still out. Mr. Trump seemed pleased if impassive toward Mr. Pence, shaking his hand and pointing at him as if to say, “How about this guy?” The two men then faced the crowd as cameras clicked, offering a grinning tableau of a possible Republican ticket. Mr. Trump is expected to announce his selection by the end of the week. “How’s your governor doing, by the way?” Mr. Trump asked shortly after he began speaking as the crowd cheered. “Good? I think so, I think so.”
us/politics,Mr. Pence’s audition here, on the outskirts of Indianapolis, lasted five and a half minutes and added him to the list of Republicans who have campaigned with Mr. Trump in recent days — part of a vice-presidential selection process that at times seems to resemble Mr. Trump’s reality television show, “The Apprentice.” The chemistry between them may be more important for Mr. Pence than for most on the vice-presidential shortlist. Unlike two other contenders — Newt Gingrich and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey — Mr. Pence has no political alliance with Mr. Trump. They are not social acquaintances, and Mr. Pence endorsed another candidate, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, in the Republican primaries. Yet Mr. Pence has emerged in recent days as a strong if not overwhelming consensus choice among Mr. Trump’s advisers, as well as Republicans in Washington working with the Trump campaign, according to people familiar with the campaign’s deliberations. There is broad agreement among Republicans close to Mr. Trump that Mr. Pence is the lowest-risk option still under consideration — a conventional selection whose greatest weakness might be the blandness of his political profile. And Mr. Pence has reciprocated the Trump campaign’s interest, advising his political allies that he would be very likely to accept an invitation to join the 2016 ticket. With Trump advisers having all but concluded that there is nothing disqualifying in Mr. Pence’s record, the most important remaining hurdle for Mr. Pence may have been the event here.
us/politics,Near the end of his speech, Mr. Trump offered some teasing clues into his thinking when he called Mr. Pence a “good man” and mused about his most likely honorific. “I don’t know whether he’s going be your governor or your vice president — who the hell knows,” Mr. Trump said. “But you’re going to call him, and you’re either going to say, ‘Governor or Vice President, sir, please, please speak to Mr. Trump — we’re winning too much.’” Mr. Trump has spoken favorably of Mr. Pence in recent days. Last weekend, during a fund-raising event in the Hamptons, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Pence as a successful governor who is known and respected in Washington. He had more equivocal words for some other potential running mates: Mr. Gingrich, he said, is a fearless attack dog but has “issues,” according to people present for Mr. Trump’s remarks. But he also stressed repeatedly that personal compatibility was essential for any running mate. And though Mr. Trump spoke warmly of Mr. Pence, he has not indicated a clear preference for him. A former congressman and talk-radio host, Mr. Pence has been a favorite of social and religious conservatives, with a record of fierce advocacy against abortion and same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would settle on a running mate in the next three or four days, and associates say he will be the sole decision maker in the screening process.
us/politics,Should he come away from Indiana feeling underwhelmed by Mr. Pence, he could opt for a finalist with whom he has a deeper friendship, most likely Mr. Gingrich but perhaps also Mr. Christie or Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general advising Mr. Trump. In a sign that Mr. Pence, 57, and Mr. Gingrich, 73, are under serious consideration, both men have taken steps to free themselves of other political obligations ahead of Mr. Trump’s decision. Fox News announced Tuesday that it was suspending Mr. Gingrich’s role as a contributor because of the fierce speculation about his potential vice-presidential candidacy. And Mr. Pence has advised national Republicans that he may abandon his re-election campaign in Indiana to run for vice president, prompting the Republican Governors Association to seek out backup candidates.

world/europe,Berlusconi’s Comeback Hopes Buoyed by Sicily Election Results - The New York Times ROME — A candidate backed by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi claimed victory on Monday in Sicily’s regional elections, adding momentum to Mr. Berlusconi’s own political comeback before national elections next year. This “is a victory for moderate” voters, Mr. Berlusconi said. Mr. Berlusconi’s candidate, Nello Musumeci, the candidate of a coalition of center-right parties for governor of Sicily, won with 39 percent of the vote, while the Five Star Movement’s Giancarlo Cancelleri, took nearly 35 percent. The anti-establishment movement ran on its own, becoming the island’s leading party. The vote was a decisive defeat for another former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, whose Democratic Party was part of a coalition that lost political control of the island. Mr. Renzi’s candidate, Fabrizio Micari, received just 18.5 percent of the vote, and critics accused Mr. Renzi, who is considering his own political comeback, of splitting the Democrats over the choice of a candidate. The outcome of the elections reflects the three-way deadlock that emerged from national elections in 2013, though in the case of Sicily, with a shift to the right, “perhaps anticipating a national trend,” Massimo Franco wrote in a front-page editorial in the Milan daily, Corriere della Sera, on Monday. “The least reassuring element is the confirmation of nonparticipation that kept more than half of all potential voters at home. It’s a sign of deep malaise toward the parties,” he wrote. Even the Five Star Movement that capitalizes on the crisis of the traditional parties, “was not able to attract voters who feel detached from politics,” he wrote.
world/europe,The regional poll was being closely watched in Italy as a litmus test for national elections, expected early next year, and it exposed both the strengths and the weaknesses of Italy’s political contenders. Mr. Berlusconi, who turned 81 in September, was not on the ballot. But the former four-time prime minister managed to coalesce several bickering center-right and right-leaning parties into a winning coalition, a feat he said he hoped to replicate on the national stage. While he will not be able to run next year — he is barred from elected office because of a 2013 conviction for tax fraud — Mr. Berlusconi clearly hopes to be the power behind the throne. The Five Star Movement was looking for a victory that would have allowed it to run a region of Italy for the first time, and to build credibility as a governing party after lackluster administrations in the major cities where they already hold power, like Rome. But the movement failed to gain a clear majority in the Sicilian vote. Its avowed refusal to make alliances with other political parties limits the party’s ability to maneuver, even in the event of a strong electoral showing, or to govern. Furthermore, a new, contested national elections law that passed last month allows parties to run for seats as coalitions, a measure the Five Star Movement says was introduced to keep it out of power. In any case, no coalition or party managed to win an outright majority in Sicily, forcing negotiations to find other allies, or risk a hung government.
world/europe,“Berlusconi is a great builder of electoral cartels. He’s always done it, and 20 years after he first entered into politics, he’s still there building these mosaics. But that this is the same as governing effectively is something else, the past shows that it isn’t so,” Stefano Folli, a political analyst for the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, said in a video commentary. Speaking to supporters Monday evening, Mr. Cancelleri boasted that in Sicily, the Five Star Movement “is the leading political force,” and the electoral results “sent a message to rest of Italy: Finally something can change.” Sicily, he said, represented “the change we hoped for and wanted.” Mr. Berlusconi, whose party governed Sicily as part of a coalition from 1996 to 2012, also thanked Sicilian voters for choosing “the path for change.” In a video message on his Facebook page, he said that having faced a crossroads, between “our positive revolution, or the inconclusive anger of the Five Stars,” Sicily had chosen “a liberal revolution.” “We stopped Sicily from falling into the hands of the Five Star Movement, people who have never done anything, who haven’t even administered a condominium, who have never worked,” he said. And Italians faced a similar choice in national elections in the near future, he said. “We are the only alternative.” The loss in Sicily was a smack in the face for Mr. Renzi, who stepped down from power 11 months ago after being defeated in a referendum on constitutional reform. He has struggled to keep his party in tow since then, and his leadership of the Democrats has been frequently challenged.
world/europe,On Monday, one of his left-leaning political opponents, the former ally Roberto Speranza, who started a breakaway party earlier this year, said the Sicilian vote was a “resounding defeat” for the Democrats under Mr. Renzi’s leadership and prefigured a similar scenario “on the national level.” Elections were also held in Ostia, a seaside resort near Rome, where the center-left candidate was easily beaten. A runoff ballot will be held in two weeks, pitting the Five Star Movement against the center-right candidate. Fewer than 50 percent of the eligible Sicilian voters — 2.1 million out of 4.6 million — cast ballots, the lowest ever in regional elections, widely read as a sign of collective disenchantment with politics. As if to challenge Mr. Renzi’s standing, Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star Movement’s candidate for prime minister, canceled a televised debate with him that was to be held Tuesday evening. After the Sicilian vote, Mr. Renzi’s Democratic Party “no longer has a leader,” Mr. Di Maio said. Mr. Renzi retorted that he had won his party’s primaries and would be in the television studio waiting for his opponent.

sports/olympics,For Some Athletes, Olympic Rings Give Way to the Circus Ring - The New York Times After competing in trampoline at the 2000 Olympics, Lee Brearley of Britain went on to performing double flips on stage in a zoot suit, and tumbles in full zombie attire. He staggered around like a drunk in one scene and sported a sarong in the next. “First time on Broadway, and I wear a skirt,” he said of his costume for the Cleopatra scene in “Paramour,” the Cirque du Soleil musical. By the time the Rio Olympics concluded Sunday, many athletes had gone home to begin or resume other careers. Maya DiRado, an American swimmer who won four medals in Rio, has said that a business analyst job awaits her. Michelle Carter of the United States, who won the shot-put, owns an online cosmetics business. The Canadian distance runner Lanni Marchant is a criminal defense lawyer. A number of Olympic gymnasts fall into a different, hair-raising pipeline, filling roles in the ever-expanding universe of Cirque du Soleil. In all, about 40 percent of Cirque’s performers come from artistic, rhythmic and acrobatic gymnastics backgrounds, as well as from trampoline, tumbling, diving and synchronized swimming. At the moment, 21 Olympians — two of them medalists — perform in eight United States-based Cirque du Soleil shows. Jeffrey Wammes, a gymnast from the Netherlands who ended his career in Rio, is about to make it 22. His next routine will be in Las Vegas as a cast member of “Mystère.”
sports/olympics,“For me, it’s a way of life, keeping your body in shape,” Wammes said. “You still have to show people your best, but not in a competitive way anymore. It’s like living your dream job while entertaining others.” For Cirque, recruiting high-caliber athletes is “almost a no-brainer,” said the company’s creative director, Fabrice Becker, who won an Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing for France at the 1992 Winter Olympics. Cirque, for instance, conducted a workshop with the Canadian national halfpipe team this year. Snowboarders trained on the Russian swing, a circus staple, which can send performers 30 feet in the air. Still, the transition from serious competitor to performer can be challenging. As if it were not hard enough to nail a somersault on a trampoline, try doing it while in costume — perhaps as a cricket, with six legs. To prepare for such a role in “Ovo,” in which most of the characters are bugs, Brearley did what any self-respecting actor would do: He consulted YouTube. “I saw this video, ‘Crickets Fighting,’” he said. “I thought it would be the most amazing video, but it was the most boring video I’ve ever seen. They kind of crawled over each other, and it took all of five minutes. But it taught me something. “Insects sit there until it’s time to frighten the hell out of you,” he continued. Actors, on the other hand, think “doing nothing is wrong, so they tend to do too much.” Some athletes find the transition fairly smooth.
sports/olympics,“I view it as going pro as a synchronized swimmer,” said Christina Jones, a 2008 Olympian in that sport for the United States and a performer in the water-themed show “O.” “I know no one would care about my sculling techniques in an office, so I’m grateful I’m able to cash in on my lifelong work.” The Cirque life often provides a career a second act. Or a third. Terry Bartlett competed in gymnastics at three Olympics for Britain and retired after the Barcelona Games in 1992. Unsure of what to do next, he stumbled on a Cirque du Soleil audition while on vacation in California and accepted a job as an acrobat in “Mystère” in Las Vegas. After his acrobatic skills began to wane, Bartlett turned to clowning almost 10 years ago. At 52, he now stars in “O,” wearing a loosey-goosey sailor suit, a clown nose and shoes the size of flippers. Instead of twists and tumbles, there are slapstick and high jinks. Suzannah Bianco, competing under her maiden name, Dyroen, won a gold medal in synchronized swimming for the United States in 1996 alongside her sister, Becky, who was the choreographer for a synchronized swimming scene in “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.” The sisters have also performed together in “O,” which features pools.
sports/olympics,“I still enjoy performing, being in the water,” Bianco said. “I enjoy sitting at the opening of the show and sitting in the silence of all the blue bubbles that are going around me and it’s not yet showtime. That space is an amazing environment that I can’t find anywhere else in the world. I can take the joy of being on stage in those moments, and it’s pervasive throughout my whole show.” Brearley is the only Olympian in “Paramour,” from a cast that includes 10 former members of national gymnastics or acrobatics teams. The set, which weighs more than 18 tons, is a cityscape of roofs, fire escapes and scaffolding. Hidden from view are two trampolines. In the show’s climatic moment, paparazzi and Dick Tracy-esque characters stage an elaborate chase-and-fight scene on rooftops. Bodies crisscross in midair like human juggling pins, nearly colliding. Fourteen acrobats and actors share the mayhem before the focus narrows on Brearley for his solo. It is a routine full of doubles, pikes, twists and planks. He does five, maybe six low somersaults in one spot in rapid fire. All that is visible is the blur of a circle, a cartoonlike cloud of Road Runner dust. Brearley’s solo is short, but he is motivated by the same dread that drove him as an Olympian — the fear of failure. “I don’t want to fail,” he said. “I want people to see a good trampoline performance.” At the end of that madcap somersault bit, he dizzily stumbles through a door and exits the stage.
sports/olympics,Applause follows, and that, too, feels exactly the same.

us/politics,Bernie Sanders, a Hunting-State Senator, Treads Lightly With Guns - The New York Times After the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado, Senator Bernie Sanders said that gun control was a matter best left resolved in state capitals. In the aftermath of the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut, Mr. Sanders voiced support for new gun control measures, but also noted that the rights of law-abiding gun owners “must be protected.” In fact, Mr. Sanders sounded downright skeptical of the push for tighter new laws. “If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen,” he told Seven Days, an alternative weekly in Vermont. Mr. Sanders’s statements on gun control, while less forceful than those of some other Democrats, did not seem out of place for a senator from a state where hunting is prevalent. But with last week’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon stirring debate about America’s gun laws, Mr. Sanders’s attitudes toward gun control and the Second Amendment are facing fresh scrutiny as his presidential bid gains steam. While Mr. Sanders has outflanked Hillary Rodham Clinton by appealing to liberals, his record on gun-related issues could be a potential vulnerability in a Democratic contest in which he is not accustomed to facing doubts about his liberal credentials. Campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday, another Democratic rival, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, called on Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to support a series of proposals he had laid out to address gun violence.
us/politics,And on Monday, Mrs. Clinton detailed a gun  control plan, a mix of legislative and executive action that included an expansion of background checks. “How much longer will we just shrug?” Mrs. Clinton asked at a town hall gathering in New Hampshire. For Mrs. Clinton, the issue is an opportunity to present herself as the most proactive Democratic candidate on gun control, and provide a contrast with Mr. Sanders, who has been gaining on her in national polls. Mr. Sanders, for his part, is trying to balance representing a state where guns are mainly used for recreation against the need to appeal to a Democratic electorate increasingly agitated over mass shootings and demanding stricter gun control laws. As he focuses his message on economic inequality, Mr. Sanders has seemed less than eager to discuss the issue of gun control. At a rally on Saturday in Boston, he waited until an hour into his speech to allude to the Oregon massacre. Mr. Sanders voted against the Brady Bill in the 1990s, requiring background checks, when he was in the House of Representatives. And in 2005, he voted in favor of a bill to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. (Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, voted against that bill, and is pledging to repeal it as part of her gun control plan.) After the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Mr. Sanders, by then a senator, voted for expanding background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
us/politics,His positioning has not endeared him to those on either side of the issue. When he last ran for re-election in 2012, the National Rifle Association gave him a D-minus rating. This summer, a “super PAC” supporting Mr. O’Malley released an ad that concluded, “Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.” “I think it’s a little bit unfair to call him pro-gun,” said Bertram Johnson, the chairman of the political science department at Middlebury College in Vermont. “I think it would be fairer to say he’s more in line with what the state thinks about this.” Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, defended the senator’s record on Monday, saying he has supported banning assault weapons and requiring background checks since he was first elected to Congress in 1990. Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders opposed the Brady Bill because of the waiting period it imposed. After the Oregon shootings, Mr. Sanders issued a statement calling for a “comprehensive approach” to deter mass killings, including “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.” In an interview on MSNBC, he took a pragmatic approach. He said the nation needed to “get beyond the shouting” on the issue of guns and added, “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is.” “You can sit there and say, well, I think we should do this and do that,” he said. “But you got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all. And if we are going to have some success, we are going to have to start talking to each other.”
us/politics,In a statement on Monday, Mr. Sanders said his campaign was assembling a package of proposals to address gun violence. He expressed support for closing the so-called gun show loophole and for banning assault weapons, among other things. Mr. Sanders has also tried to draw attention to the different role of guns in his state compared with more densely populated areas, where guns are often associated with violence, not recreation. “The people of my state understand, I think, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or guns in Los Angeles,” he said in July on CNN. Vermont has a high level of gun ownership compared with other states in the Northeast. It also has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. At the same time, Vermont has few murders committed with firearms. “It’s a different life situation up here, and I think Senator Sanders has tried to explain that,” said Evan Hughes, a vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs. “His voting record has reflected the Vermont reality.” Ann Braden, the president of Gun Sense Vermont, a group that formed after the Newtown shootings and advocates new gun laws, said Mr. Sanders’s focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands — but not attacking the mere idea of gun ownership — was “how you can actually make change.” “There are many, many responsible gun owners,” she said, “and it’s important to have someone who understands that.”
science,Lyrid Meteor Shower Is Spectacular, Albeit Obscured - The New York Times More than 2,700 years ago, Chinese astronomers observed a night in which “stars fell like rain.” Today, we call this celestial display the Lyrid meteor shower. The annual light show began Saturday, peaks this Friday, and ends April 25. The Lyrid meteors streak through space at about 107,000 miles per hour and explode about 55 miles in the sky. But even during its peak, we’ll barely see a drizzle. “This year’s not a good viewing time for Lyrids,” said Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. “The moonlight is going to wash out many of the meteors.” The moon is waxing and on Friday, it will be full. Most years, you can see 15 to 20 meteors blaze across the sky every hour, but this time, we will likely see only one or two an hour, Dr. Cooke said. Compared with other annual showers, the Lyrids puts on a moderate show. That’s because its source, Comet Thatcher, typically leaves behind less debris than other comets do as it orbits the sun. Comets are often described as dirty snowballs. As they voyage through the solar system, they spew specks of ice and rock. The dusty trails linger in space long after the comet leaves, only to burn ephemerally when Earth passes through the stream, creating a meteor shower.
science,Comet Thatcher makes its journey around the sun roughly every 415 years. Its last trip was in 1861 and it will make its next rendezvous in 2276. According to Dr. Cooke, when we see a Lyrid shower, we are seeing debris that fell from the comet not during its 1861 orbit, but from its previous one, around 1446, or even an earlier one. “Because the comet’s orbit does not intersect Earth’s,” he said, “the debris must have time to drift away in order for us to run into it.” Some of the sparks we see during a shower come from cosmic crumbs no bigger than a pebble. It’s not the size that determines how bright it will be, Dr. Cooke said. Rather, it’s the speed at which its particles pierces the sky. But, again, don’t expect to catch many shooting stars this week. As a consolation prize, the Perseids shower in August will be extra strong, according to Dr. Cooke, sending out 200 to 250 flares an hour — a meteor monsoon.
us,Police and Protesters Clash in Minneapolis Over Fatal Shooting of Black Man - The New York Times The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a Minneapolis officer led to a tense standoff between the police and protesters Wednesday night. The police used chemical irritants after they said protesters had thrown bricks and bottles, as clashes over the shooting death of Jamar Clark intensified. Mr. Clark, 24, was shot in the head early Sunday and died at a hospital the next day. Protests started within hours as some neighbors said that Mr. Clark had been handcuffed when he was shot, which contradicted statements by the Minneapolis police. Demonstrators pitched tents outside a police station near the shooting scene, and on Monday night dozens were arrested after marching onto an Interstate and blocking traffic. Tensions escalated Wednesday afternoon when officers moved in to clear the protesters’ campsite at the police station, infuriating activists who had pledged to stay until specific demands had been met, including the release of video evidence. The police maneuver set off hours of confrontation between officers and demonstrators, documented by both sides on Twitter, that grew more tense as a cold, rainy day turned into night. Mayor Betsy Hodges of Minneapolis issued a statement calling on “officers to exercise maximum restraint” and asking “protesters to act peacefully.” “I understand that emotions are running high in the community and across the city,” Ms. Hodges’s statement said. “I share many of the emotions that people are feeling in Minneapolis today.”
us,On Twitter, the Minneapolis police acknowledged shooting a “marking round” at a man who they said had been throwing bricks. The police then accused members of the crowd of using mace against officers, prompting rebukes from protesters who said it was actually the police who had been spraying the chemical. Later, the police said officers and protesters had both sprayed a “chemical irritant.” Wednesday’s unrest came after officials met two of the protesters’ demands by starting a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting and by releasing the names of the two officers involved. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, are both seven-year veterans of law enforcement but are relatively new to the Minneapolis force, with each having worked there for 13 months. Minneapolis is the latest American city to experience protests over the death of a black person at the hands of police. Since Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was fatally shot in August 2014 by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., large demonstrations have taken place over violent episodes in several cities, including Baltimore, Cleveland and New York. As in some other cases, Minneapolis protesters have sought video evidence to resolve discrepancies between the accounts of the police and of witnesses. The police said Mr. Clark was a suspect in an assault and that he had interfered with paramedics attempting to treat his victim. When officers arrived, the police said, he fought with them, leading to the gunfire. Some who said they witnessed the incident disputed that account, saying on social media or to local reporters that Mr. Clark was handcuffed when he was shot.
us,Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is conducting the state investigation, has said the officers involved were not wearing body cameras and that there was no dashboard camera video from police cruisers. Mr. Evans said that cellphone video, surveillance footage from nearby buildings and a camera in an ambulance had all captured portions of the encounter, but not all of it. Mr. Evans said releasing that footage immediately, as protesters have requested, could compromise the investigation. At a news conference on Wednesday morning, Javille Burns, a sister of Mr. Clark’s, said her brother was well regarded by people in his neighborhood and that he “did not deserve” to die. “We don’t want revenge,” Ms. Burns said. “We do want justice.”
world/africa,Ethiopian Marathoner’s Protest Puts Him at Odds With His Government - The New York Times As Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia crossed the finish line in his silver-medal marathon run at the Rio Olympics on Sunday, he raised his arms and crossed them in an X, a gesture of protest against his country’s government that he said could get him killed if he returned home. He is uncertain where he will go next, and what will become of his wife and two children in Ethiopia. “If I go back to Ethiopia, maybe they will kill me,” he said at a news conference after the race, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. “If I am not killed, maybe they will put me in prison.” Ethiopia’s communications minister, Getachew Reda, told CNN that Mr. Lilesa “shouldn’t at all be worried” to return, calling him an “Ethiopian hero.” “I can assure you nothing is going to happen to his family; nothing is going to happen to him,” Mr. Reda said. An accomplished distance runner who has one of the 50 fastest marathon times, Mr. Lilesa defied an Olympic prohibition on political demonstrations to make his statement, raising his arms again in protest at an award ceremony after the race. He told reporters he had not discussed the protest ahead of time with others, including his manager, teammates and family, out of fear for his safety. Soon after his gesture, Mr. Lelisa quickly attracted supporters on social media.
world/africa,Antigovernment protests in Ethiopia, an American ally that has experienced stability and a growing economy over the past decade, have been growing recently, with thousands of people demanding political changes. Human rights groups say the protests have been met by brutal crackdowns by the government, including the shooting deaths of unarmed protesters. A Human Rights Watch report in June estimated that more than 400 people had been killed in seven months, almost all of them civilians. Protesters in the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia’s largest, say they feel marginalized. The Tigrayan ethnic group makes up about 6 percent of the population but dominates in politics, the military and commerce. “The Ethiopian government is killing my people, so I stand with all protests anywhere, as Oromo is my tribe,” Mr. Lilesa said, according to The Washington Post. “My relatives are in prison, and if they talk about democratic rights they are killed.” Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia, predicted that the Ethiopian government will indeed treat Mr. Lelisa like a hero, at least publicly. “They will not do anything silly against that guy,” he said. “The whole world knows about him now,” Mr. Teshome said. “If they arrest him, it will be a huge mistake and create a further disturbance.” The Ethiopian government is known to be quite adept at damage control, using urbane officials to deflect criticism. So far, it seems to have worked.
world/africa,Human rights groups have complained for years about repression and brutality inside Ethiopia, but the government continues to maintain friendly ties with the West, which sees Ethiopia as a stable ally in a region that has been plagued by violent extremism and chaos. President Obama, for example, visited Ethiopia in 2015. Mr. Teshome said, however, that Mr. Lilesa’s act — crossing his arms at a moment when millions were watching him on TV — had been a blow to the carefully constructed image the government has tried to project. He said that many Ethiopians were impressed by Mr. Lelisa’s courage, and that “everybody is talking about it” in the town where Mr. Teshome lives, Woliso, and across social media. But Mr. Teshome said that on Monday, the state-controlled media was not broadcasting any images of Mr. Lelisa with his arms crossed. “This was what the government was afraid of,” he said. Mr. Lelisa told reporters on Sunday he did not know where he would go next, but mentioned Kenya and the United States as possibilities, according to a video from LetsRun.com. Mr. Teshome said he expected that Mr. Lelisa would not return to Ethiopia, even if officials pledged he would be safe. “Whether they treat him well or not doesn’t make a difference; he was protesting what happens to his people, the killing of his people,” Mr. Teshome said. “We are living in a dictatorial state, a totalitarian state.”
world/europe,Sex Abuse Trial of Ex-Vatican Envoy Is Delayed - The New York Times VATICAN CITY —  The trial of a former Vatican ambassador accused of sexually abusing boys while stationed in the Dominican Republic and of possessing child pornography was adjourned indefinitely on Saturday after he fell ill and was hospitalized. The defendant, Jozef Wesolowski, 66, was taken to an Italian hospital for an “unexpected illness” on Friday, the Vatican said in a statement. The trial will resume when Mr. Wesolowski recovers, it said. Before the adjournment, the Vatican’s chief prosecutor, Gian Piero Milano, accused Mr. Wesolowski of purchasing and retaining on his two computers an “enormous quantity” of child pornography and of sexually abusing a number of boys in the Dominican Republic presumed to have been 13 to 16 years old. Mr. Wesolowski, a former archbishop, is also accused of causing serious harm to the boys he is accused of abusing and of offending “Christian morality,” Mr. Milano said in a statement released Saturday. If found guilty, Mr. Wesolowski could face up to eight years in prison, though the sentence could be lengthened if the Vatican court decides that there are aggravating circumstances. Mr. Wesolowski’s lawyer has promised to fight the accusations, a Vatican spokesman said. On Saturday, he said his client had been willing to attend the trial before he fell sick.
world/europe,Mr. Wesolowski is the first top Vatican official to stand trial on sexual abuse charges in the Vatican since Pope Francis issued new rules that allowed prosecutors more leeway in such cases. Abuse victims have lamented that for decades, the Catholic Church has covered up cases of abuse or has not properly punished the perpetrators or their supervisors. Mr. Wesolowski was secretly recalled from the Dominican Republic in 2013 before local authorities there could investigate the accusations against him. He remained free inside Vatican City until September 2014, when he was placed under house arrest. He was defrocked by a Vatican court in June 2014. Francis is not the first pontiff to publicly confront the issue of abusive clergy or to revise Vatican rules to discipline priests who engaged in sexual abuse, but he is the first to take action against their superiors. Last month, Francis approved the creation of a Vatican tribunal to try bishops accused of covering up for priests or failing to take action. He has also created a papal commission on abuse that includes two abuse survivors and lay people under the guidance of the archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley.
arts/television,Her Shot: Hillary Clinton Shares a Vision of America Out of ‘Hamilton’ - The New York Times Toward the end of her acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, Hillary Clinton paraphrased the musical “Hamilton”: “Though we may not live to see the glory,” she said, “let us gladly join the fight.” But really, her convention had been quoting “Hamilton” for four days. Like that Broadway phenomenon — which retells American history with a diverse cast and a hip-hop score — the Democrats’ convention in Philadelphia argued that progressive inclusiveness isn’t incompatible with muscular patriotism. In fact, its stagecraft — including the retired Marine Gen. John R. Allen’s endorsing Mrs. Clinton with a diverse group of veterans, male and female — suggested that you need one to have the other. The convention, like the American Revolution, was not without its intramural fights. Even after a choreographed show of unity with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, some of his supporters booed and yelled during Mrs. Clinton’s speech, throwing off its rhythm as delegates chanted “Hillary!” to drown them out. Overall, though, the Democratic convention was a much slicker television production than the Republican one, which nominated an actual TV star. The cast was more star-studded with politicians and entertainers. The nights’ themes were more clearly drawn. On a sheer technical level, it seemed as if professionals were running the operation. (Mrs. Clinton’s video image smashed a virtual glass barrier the night she became the first female major-party nominee for president; the third night of the Republican convention, a video wall went on the fritz.)
arts/television,That’s show business. But the production choices of each convention echoed its themes. The Democrats’ event was more conventionally TV-ready. Punctuated with musical performances and comedy videos from Funny or Die, it was like a Super Bowl halftime show for progressive politics geeks. Donald J. Trump’s convention — it could only nominally be called the Republicans’ — was like cable reality TV or pro wrestling. It was rough and ran hot, with big moments like Mr. Trump’s first-night entrance to Queen’s “We Are the Champions” and his stare-down with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who declined to endorse him from the stage. There was a message embedded in each production style. Mr. Trump’s production argued: “These are ugly times; we have enemies within and without; I will hit them hard; I will bust up the system.” The Democrats — who overtly pitched to moderate Republicans unnerved by Mr. Trump’s end-times, barbarians-at-the-gate rhetoric — were saying: “We will keep things on track; we’re levelheaded; we’re broad-minded, but so are you.” Mr. Trump, like any challenger from the outside party, framed the choice as change versus more of the same. The Democrats framed it as “I” versus “we.” “Follow me” versus “Join us.” Radical nationalism versus patriotic multiculturalism. Dystopianism versus optimism. “Fear the Walking Dead” versus “Friday Night Lights.”
arts/television,Mrs. Clinton’s mini-series shaped that frame over a four-night arc. The first night called a truce with Senator Sanders’s left-wing insurgency. The second night played to Democratic base concerns, including an appearance by mothers of children killed by the police or by gun violence. The third night had Michael R. Bloomberg, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and President Obama casting Mr. Trump as outside small-d democratic norms. The final night included tributes to fallen police officers and soldiers. Some of the instant analysis suggested that the four nights moved from left to right, from appeasing the base to courting the middle. But seen as a whole, the convention — which ended with the crowd waving flags — didn’t go from diversity to patriotism. It said the two are inseparable, that progressivism is mainstream, even square. That was a recurring note in the week’s big speeches. But it came through most powerfully Thursday night from Khizr Khan, the father of an American Muslim soldier who died in Iraq. Mr. Khan directly addressed Mr. Trump, who he said “consistently smears” Muslims’ character. “Have you even read the United States Constitution?” Mr. Khan asked. “I will gladly lend you my copy.” Then he pulled out a pocket-size Constitution — a favorite totem of Tea Party Republicans in recent years. Mr. Khan, like many of the week’s speakers, was an immigrant, another Hamiltonian echo. (“Immigrants — we get the job done.”)
arts/television,And in Mrs. Clinton’s speech, she fitted her opponent with an absurd crown to cast him as her show’s erratic, vain and autocratic King George. Mrs. Clinton recalled Philadelphia’s role in the American Revolution, directly rebutting Mr. Trump’s convention speech, in which he said that he — “I alone” — could cure the country’s ills. “Our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power,” she said. That line of attack was typical of this campaign’s pattern, Trump-CounterTrump. It was also a useful framing for Mrs. Clinton, who has been as publicity-shy as her opponent is spotlight-thirsty, who has a long public record and lots of detractors. Running against the self-aggrandizer-in-chief, Mrs. Clinton owned up to her prosaic, wonky instincts. “It’s true: I sweat the details of policy,” she said. “Because it’s not just a detail if it’s your kid, if it’s your family. It’s a big deal.” Her campaign slogan, “Stronger Together,” both disputed Mr. Trump’s me-me-me aria and suggested that the election was bigger than she was. It invited viewers to consider not just her speech but also the four nights of endorsers and validators, from Mr. Obama to her daughter, Chelsea. If Mr. Trump’s case was “I am your voice,” Mrs. Clinton invited us to consider our voices hers. (Her speech even opened with segments recalling the convention’s highest-profile speeches, a kind of “Previously on ‘The Hillary Show’” introduction.) If you’re not sure if you trust me, she seemed to say, trust them when they tell you they trust me.
arts/television,Were the Democrats stronger together? Stronger is for the fall to decide, and they weren’t wholly together. (Symbolically, a stadium-style closing “card stunt” in which the audience would form a picture by holding up colored placards fell apart into a mush of red, white and blue.) The Democrats put together the stronger TV program, though, against an opponent who spent years in prime-time TV. And their “Hamilton”-esque messaging set a frame: us against him. But it’s worth noting that the song Mrs. Clinton referred to, “The Story of Tonight,” comes in the musical at the uncertain beginning of a war, not its end. The first act of the 2016 election is over. Stretch your legs during intermission; I hear the second act’s a long one.
fashion/mens-style,Ta-Nehisi Coates on Creating Black Superheroes - The New York Times When Marvel Comics announced in September 2015 that Ta-Nehisi Coates would be writing a new Black Panther series, the timing could not have been more fortuitous. That same month, Mr. Coates, who writes regularly for The Atlantic, was awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation “genius grant,” and, two months later, a National Book Award for nonfiction for “Between the World and Me,” his passionate letter to his son about being black in America. The momentum for the hero was also tremendous. Issue No. 1 of Black Panther hit stores last April and went on to sell more than 300,000 copies, according to Marvel. He then made his big screen debut in May, with “Captain America: Civil War,” and was played by Chadwick Boseman, who will reprise the role in a solo film next year. In July came “Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet,” a collected edition of the first four issues of the comic. It was followed, in November, by World of Wakanda, a companion series in which Mr. Coates introduced two more newcomers to the roster of comic-book scribes: the feminist writer Roxane Gay and the poet Yona Harvey. This April comes a new series, Black Panther and the Crew, a team comprising only black heroes, written by Mr. Coates and Ms. Harvey. Mr. Coates answered questions about the success of Black Panther, his approach to writing, the members of the Crew and what’s next. (The interview has been edited and condensed.)
fashion/mens-style,Q. Does the response to the Black Panther series surprise you? A. I guess I am in awe of the response a little bit, but I don’t know, man. I’m in the zone of writing, and that place is still really, really hard and really, really challenging. What I’m trying to do is to learn more. I’m reading a lot more, and reading as a fan is very, very different to reading as a creator. Maybe reading as a critic is close to it, but actually trying to figure out what people are doing and why it has certain effects on me is a very, very different way of looking at stuff. Selling is important because I want the book to continue, but when I’m done, I want people to say: “This was a classic run. This is one of the best things Marvel ever did.” You must feel a certain level of confidence, or do you try not to reflect until the story is over? I do think about it but I don’t think it will probably be knowable until a few more years. I don’t mean to impugn anybody that’s buying the series — I really, really appreciate it — but I think, often times, things may not always be appreciated in their time, where it turns out later that this was actually something great. And at the same time, there are probably things that are appreciated in their time that probably don’t pass the test of time.
fashion/mens-style,How much of this is the movie? How much of this is Panther’s improved profile right now? How much of this is “Between the World and Me”? I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. What I want people to feel ultimately is that this is part of the entire oeuvre that I put together. I don’t want it to be “Ta-Nehisi just took a break and did comics.” It is not a break for me. You always seem to be working. I try to be prolific, but not in a bad way. I don’t want it to be that I was just turning stuff out. With the Crew, I made the decision to put them in the Panther comic relatively early, and we had talked about a series. But unless I had what I thought was a really, really compelling story, and something that was compelling to me, there didn’t feel like that was a reason to do it. So now you have a story that justifies the spinoff? I think I’ve hit upon a story that I feel people should read, that people are going to want to read. I think the biggest influence on this book is Ed Brubaker’s work both on Captain America and some stuff he did after he was gone. I’m just hoping — I can’t be Ed Brubaker; there’s only one Ed Brubaker — that it’ll have that influence.
fashion/mens-style,The Black Panther book itself is so steeped in Wakanda, the fictional African country of his birth. Is this a nice break, given that the new book is set in Harlem? It is, but Wakanda is part of even this story. I like being in Wakanda. I was a big Dungeons & Dragons player when I was a kid. It’s a chance to just go back and be in this world that you create. At the same time, it has these moments where it intersects with the Marvel Universe, which is pretty cool, too. How does the political climate now affect your writing? Do you save that for — and I’m going to put quotes around this — your “real” writing, your nonfiction writing? [Laughs.] It has to influence. I think that is the tradition, actually, for comic book writers. Maybe not for all of them, but certainly the ones to which I was exposed. I think about this all the time. When you take a book like Spider-Man or Daredevil and the big thing is crime fighting, I don’t think that’s distant from the time when those characters were created. During that period, we had this rising crime, and the city was seen a certain way in a way that Manhattan is not seen today. Even the decision to create Black Panther: It was not an apolitical decision to have this black character in Africa, in this advanced nation, and have him be highly intelligent. All of these were political decisions.
fashion/mens-style,Is there anything along those lines that you’re going to explore in the Crew? We’ll definitely be exploring this issue of the police — maybe not how people would expect, but we will be. Do you ever try to write anything that is appealing to a young reader? That’s hard for me to answer. When I was a kid reading the books, I don’t think they were made for people my age, necessarily. I started reading Marvel when I was 9 or 10. I think the “Mutant Massacre” happened when I was 11 or 12. I don’t know if that stuff was meant for someone my age or if the writers were thinking about that. But I love that stuff. It was provocative. How do you filter reader reaction to your comic work? How do I put this? I think, given that I’m writing for myself, it is hard for me to do that. Fans can say whatever, but if I’m not excited by it, I’m not going to do it. I don’t know if this is good or bad, but my excitement is much more important than their excitement. [Laughs.] And I think ultimately their excitement will come from my excitement. How has the collaboration process been with your artists, Brian Stelfreeze and Chris Sprouse, on the main book, and Butch Guice, on the Crew?
fashion/mens-style,It has been excellent. Brian has been extraordinary, and Chris has been extraordinary. I’ve seen the stuff from Butch and it’s incredible. I used to look at Butch’s stuff when I was a kid. It’s just fascinating now to be working with this guy. I’m in awe. I sent him this note, just gushing. Is your approach to writing the comic different than your approach to your nonfiction work? I don’t think so. It still requires an incredible amount of research. I guess writing is always this way: You research and you write, you research and you write. Is the Crew, a team first published in 2003, something you thought about from the beginning of your Black Panther run? I wanted to bring back the original Crew, but as it happens, some of those folks were not available. I had to then think about other folks. In the process of doing that it became this thing of, you know, there ain’t no women in the original Crew. That was a different era. This is like 15 years later. I opted to do something a little different. All these people have relationships with Black Panther. That was the big qualification. I wanted Storm to be in the book. He had this previous relationship with Luke Cage, and he had a previous relationship with Manifold. And I think he and Misty worked together before, but she’s probably the least tied in to the Panther world. But she’s tied into Luke Cage, and she’s tied into Storm from way back in the day.
fashion/mens-style,I remember that story. That’s old school right there. A lot of these characters are also deeply tied to Harlem. Storm’s dad was from Harlem. Cage is from Harlem. That’s how they meet the first time. Harlem wasn’t chosen at random. What was your inspiration for the Crew story? They were in and out of Black Panther so quickly, I’m glad they are coming back. You’re right about that. And I guess I kind of knew that. Did I know that? Maybe I didn’t know that. I knew I would revisit them again. I knew Marvel was interested in a possible series and maybe I was thinking about it at the time. I don’t think you should expect a team full of people who are — how do I put this? — die-hard Black Lives Matter people. I think you should expect to read people who are trying to figure out their relationship to Harlem, their relationship, in this arc, to the police and their relationship to the protest movement that they are seeing around them. The last time we talked, you were thinking about Black Panther ideas during an international flight. How do you get it all done? I don’t know. I mean, it’s the joy of my life. It’s hard to think about what else would I be doing. I live a very, very simple life. I have my family and I have my work and I have a few friends. That leaves plenty of time.
fashion/mens-style,What is a typical day for you? I get up in the morning and I usually take a swimming lesson. I’m still trying to learn how to swim, trying to get this figured out. Once, twice or three times a week, if I’m lucky, I see my French professor. And my kid is like 16, so he’s on autopilot. For the most part, the rest of the time is writing. There’s a lot of open space. And the World of Wakanda is ticking along. I’m really proud. That’s mostly Roxane, and I think she’s done an excellent job. Do you think you’re going to recruit any more writers into the industry? Stay tuned. Stay tuned.
science,The Winter Was Wet, but California Could Get Thirsty Again - The New York Times When California officials announced an end to restrictions on urban water use, they cited the recent wet winter as one reason. El Niño, the climate pattern that brought a succession of storms to Northern California, had given the state a reprieve from its water woes, they said. Those storms left a mountain snowpack that, while ordinary by historical standards, far exceeded the meager accumulations of 2015. The healthy snowpack — which will provide about one-third of the state’s water as it melts this spring — and successful efforts to sharply reduce water use gave officials enough confidence to suspend the restrictions that had been imposed last April. At the same time, they acknowledged that California’s five-year drought was far from over, especially in Southern California, where El Niño did not have much of an impact. They kept agricultural restrictions in place and said they could impose new statewide curbs if drier-than-normal conditions returned. The odds of that happening would appear to be strong, as signaled by two announcements that occurred around the same time as California’s decision to lift the water restrictions. One, the news that the water level at Lake Mead, the huge reservoir on the Colorado River, has reached a historical low, suggested that long-term problems for the water supply in California related to a warming climate have not changed. The other suggested that there is a potential short-term challenge ahead, in the form of La Niña.
science,This month, forecasters with the federal Climate Prediction Center and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society issued their latest seasonal outlook, saying that El Niño was coming to an end and that the odds now favored the development of La Niña by the fall. “Our models are pretty much in agreement — over the next several months they are really flipping us into a La Niña,” said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. El Niño and La Niña are two sides of the same story, one that involves atmospheric pressure, prevailing winds and sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. When average water temperatures in the eastern Pacific rise by a certain amount above normal, forecasters declare an El Niño. Eventually, though, the water begins to cool, which is what is happening now. Mr. Halpert and his colleagues say as of now there is a 75 percent possibility that water temperatures will fall far enough by the end of summer to result in La Niña. As with El Niño, the jet streams that circle the planet would be affected, though in different ways. That in turn would affect weather in North America and around the world. Just as with El Niño, because there are many other variables that affect the weather, there are no certainties of specific La Niña-related effects in specific locales.
science,But typically, Mr. Halpert said, La Niña brings wet weather to the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley and drier-than-average conditions across the southern part of the country. (Forecasters are making no predictions about effects in the Northeast.) For California, Mr. Halpert said, La Niña could mean another dry winter in the south, while the far northern part of the state could be slightly wetter than normal. Because winter is when California gets nearly all of its precipitation, that could put more pressure on water supplies. On the day of California’s announcement, the federal Bureau of Reclamation reported that the level of Lake Mead, which stretches across the Nevada desert behind Hoover Dam, was slightly more than 1,074 feet above sea level. That is the lowest level since the dam was filled in the 1930s, and is 150 feet below the level when the reservoir was last full, in 1983. Put another way, Lake Mead, part of the Colorado River system that supplies water to California and six other Western states, is now at 37 percent of capacity. The lake level is something of an arbitrary milestone — it can and will be raised later this year by increasing releases from Lake Powell, upstream on the Colorado. That will help avoid triggering reductions in the amount of water allotted to Arizona and Nevada. But the historic low is another symbol of the devastating drought that has affected the Rocky Mountain basin for a decade and a half, said Jonathan Overpeck, a director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona.
science,And if the drought continues, the lake level could fall even farther, potentially triggering cutbacks to California’s annual allotment of 4.4 million acre-feet, or about 10 percent of the water the state uses in a year. The Rocky Mountain basin has been through droughts before, Dr. Overpeck said, but this one is different. Previous droughts were marked by lower-than-normal precipitation, he said, but with this one, “the precipitation hasn’t been that low.” “But it’s been much warmer than normal,” he said. “This is what I like to call a hot drought, or a climate-change drought. And there’s going to be more and more of them in the future.” Warmer temperatures have the same effect in the Rockies as they do in the Sierra Nevada. They reduce snowpack because more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and snow accumulates at higher elevations than before, meaning less terrain is covered. Warmer spring temperatures can also make the snowpack melt faster, which in extreme circumstances can force water managers to dump water out of reservoirs to protect against flooding. (Although the Sierra snowpack has been melting fairly fast this spring, a representative of the California Department of Water Resources said that the reservoirs had not been affected.) Dr. Overpeck said that the upper basin of the Colorado — mostly parts of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado — was warming as quickly as anywhere in the continental United States. “As the atmosphere warms, it is holding more moisture, and it has to get that moisture from somewhere,” he said.
science,The region normally goes through wet and dry cycles, he added, and could enter a wet period that might last for a decade or two. So it is possible that Lake Mead could some day be filled to capacity once more. “But the chances go down because of the effects of warming,” Dr. Overpeck said. On the other hand, he added, “we could also go into a major precipitation deficit that lasts for decades.” “Couple that with warming and it would be just devastating.”

world/europe,German Cabinet Backs Measures to Ease Deportation of Criminals - The New York Times BERLIN —  The German cabinet endorsed measures on Wednesday that would make it easier to deport many noncitizens convicted of crimes, responding to outrage over the sexual assault of hundreds of women by foreigners on New Year’s Eve and growing skepticism about the government’s ability to accommodate more than one million asylum seekers. The legislation would lower the bar for denying criminals the right to stay in Germany, allowing the authorities to require anyone to leave the country if convicted of homicide, bodily harm, sexual assault, violent theft or serial shoplifting, even if given only a suspended sentence. The measures require approval in Parliament, but Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition holds a majority there and they are expected to pass easily. Ms. Merkel’s refusal to limit the number of migrants entering the country has damaged her popularity and caused a rift in her governing coalition. Other countries in Europe have declined to take in a proportionate share of the migrants who continue to arrive by the thousands, and several have instead responded with measures to restrict migrants. Germany’s persistent willingness to accept migrants has meant that ever more are arriving in the country. Public support, however, has shifted from the ecstatic welcome of the summer to increasing unease that only worsened after asylum seekers were linked to sexual assaults on women celebrating the New Year in Cologne. Heiko Maas, the justice minister, said the measures were in the interest of everyone in the country.
world/europe,“This also helps to protect the hundreds of thousands of refugees who live respectable lives among us,” Mr. Maas said. “They do not deserve to be lumped together with criminals.” Under the new law, any criminals with pending applications for asylum in Germany will have their applications withdrawn, and they will be ordered to leave the country. Foreign criminals who have served sentences of at least one year for all crimes will also be deported, in keeping with current laws. Although the changes will make it easier to revoke the right to stay of first-time criminals, many of whom are given only suspended sentences, critics contend that the law does not go far enough because if a criminal comes from a country that is not considered safe, that person cannot be deported, even if ordered to leave Germany. If an individual’s home country carries out the death penalty, it can be more difficult to ultimately deport someone.
us,In Police Shootings, Finding Jurors Who Will Say ‘Not Guilty’ - The New York Times When two Albuquerque police officers went on trial for murder last fall after the fatal shooting of a mentally ill homeless man, things did not look good for them. Police videos appeared to show the man turning away before officers fired. Their release had been preceded by a long history of police violence and followed by six days of protests. But defense lawyers thought they still had a chance — if they could get the right jury. “A jury was going to make that decision,” said Sam Bregman, who defended one of the officers. “And picking that jury was the single most important aspect of the entire trial.” Modern jury selection is a dark art practiced by a cottage industry of consultants who promise to sort antagonists from sympathizers using mock trials, questionnaires, exhaustive reviews of social media profiles and even photographs of prospective jurors’ homes. The scrutiny is likely to be no less intense as jury selection begins this week in two highly publicized police shootings. One, the death of an unarmed black man during a traffic stop in Cincinnati, has already resulted in one hung jury. The other, in which a man’s girlfriend live-streamed the moments after he was fatally wounded in a St. Paul suburb, also during a traffic stop, goes to trial for the first time.
us,Choosing a jury has become more difficult as law enforcement violence has become a national issue and the recent profusion of videos of shootings has made prosecutions of officers more common and jurors less inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. Prosecutors are looking for jurors who are usually more suspicious of law enforcement — liberals, minorities and people with arrest records — while the defense prefers conservatives, whites and the well-off, who tend to be more trusting of police officers. But those assumptions are not foolproof. A series of incidents in which videos appeared to contradict police accounts has eroded juries’ trust. “A lot of people look at cops and say, ‘Well, you probably did it because I’ve seen it over and over again on television,’” said Thomas P. Baggott, a 71-year-old clinical psychologist in Tucson who almost exclusively assists law enforcement defendants in lawsuits. That has given the jury selection process in police shooting trials an unusual twist: Discovering whether a potential juror has seen a video of the shooting is crucial. “Many people who want to be on a jury will deny they have seen the video,” Mr. Baggott said. “We have to get them to confess to us.” For prosecutors, it remains excruciatingly difficult to win a conviction against a police officer — juries must vote unanimously, so it takes only one holdout to derail a guilty verdict. Mr. Baggott, who spent 25 years as a Pennsylvania state trooper, was on one side of the jury selection face-off in Albuquerque.
us,That battle offers a primer for what is likely to occur in the two forthcoming trials. In one, Ray Tensing, who was a University of Cincinnati campus police officer when he fatally shot Samuel DuBose, 43, during a traffic stop, faces charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter. In his first trial, four jurors opposed conviction on either charge. Mr. Tensing is white, while Mr. DuBose was black. Last week, the judge ruled that a Confederate flag T-shirt that Mr. Tensing wore on the day of the shooting could not be admitted as evidence. In the other case, Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Latino, will stand trial for manslaughter after he fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, during a traffic stop. According to prosecutors, Mr. Castile, who was licensed to carry a gun, told the officer that he had a firearm moments before he was shot. Mr. Castile, who was black, was in the car with his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and her young daughter. Her Facebook video  of the aftermath has been widely seen, but audio and video from the squad car has not been released publicly and is expected to be shown at the trial. Video, however, can be far from convincing. In Albuquerque, video of the 2014 shooting of the homeless man, James Boyd, 38, and the hourslong standoff that preceded it had spread through the city, leaving virtually everyone with an opinion about what had happened — and lowering public esteem for the police in general. The case, Albuquerque’s first indictment of police officers in a shooting in at least three decades, riveted the city.
us,Mr. Baggott offered free jury consultation to the two officers, Dominique Perez and Keith Sandy, after they were indicted on a charge of murder. On the opposing side was another firm, National Jury Project, which was hired by the special prosector assigned to the case, Randi McGinn, to advise on jury selection and other issues. The two sides had a pool of 1,450 potential jurors, of whom only basics like names and addresses were known. Focusing on the first few hundred on the list, the two sides set about searching the names online and checking Facebook profiles. Mr. Baggott even checked the profiles of their friends: A juror who may not reveal much online, he said, “usually adopts the views and attitudes of people they’re friends with.” George V. Laughrun II, a lawyer from Charlotte, N.C., who defended a white police officer in a 2015 manslaughter trial for the shooting of an unarmed black man, recalled one potential juror in particular. “She had answered every question perfectly,” he said. But on Facebook, she expressed strong views against the defendant, enabling Mr. Laughrun to get her disqualified. Prosecutors in Albuquerque added a sheaf of questions to a 14-page questionnaire, which included what causes potential jurors had contributed to (law enforcement, the homeless and the National Rifle Association were among the choices) and whether they had ever felt threatened by someone with mental illness. Mr. Baggott, the defense consultant, took a different tack, dispatching workers to photograph the first 250 jurors’ homes and automobiles.
us,“I can tell a heck of a lot more about lifestyle and where a juror is going to come down by looking at your house,” Mr. Baggott said. “One guy has a white picket fence, a pickup and car in the driveway, a couple of kids’ toys on the porch. Everything’s orderly, the lawn’s mowed. This is going to be a person who pays attention to detail, a person who’s reasonable and is hard-working.” A ramshackle house and beat-up car suggest a less stable and dependable juror, he said. Vehicles offer a bonus: bumper stickers with political and religious messages that shed light on a jurors’ leanings. Both sides tried to sift out the handful of candidates that might particularly help or hinder their case. Ms. McGinn looked for potential opponents who were also leaders — people in management, or who answered questions confidently or forcefully. “If you have a question about that person, that person is more dangerous to you than a follower, because they’ll lead the jury in the other direction,” she said. The defense focused on finding “sleepers” — candidates who hid their true views of the case in a bid to win a seat on the jury — through artful questioning during the selection process. Among those who passed muster, defense lawyers flagged people in jobs that dealt with facts, like engineers who based decisions on calculations, or accountants. “They believed in order,” Luis Robles, who represented one of the officers, said in an interview. “Even if they’re not leaders, they’d fight for us if they agreed with us.”
us,The jury, six men and six women, was seated in September, heard 12 days of testimony and deliberated for two days. By mid-October, they were a hung jury: nine favored acquittal, including all six women. Three favored conviction, including the accountant. The judge declared a mistrial. Officials elected not to seek a new trial. Ms. McGinn said she was disappointed, but unsurprised. “We recognized the impossibility of our task,” she said. “It’s a huge thing to find 12 people who will convict a police officer. This was the first prosecution here. I expected a 15-minute acquittal.” Mr. Robles, on the other hand, was disappointed because there was no acquittal — and because the net they used to catch hostile jurors wasn’t fine enough. “Soon as the verdict is read, the accountant goes downstairs and holds an impromptu news conference,” he said. “I think, ‘That’s not like an accountant.’” Seeking to determine what went wrong, the lawyers asked investigators to perform some additional spadework. They found that while he held a job at an accounting firm, he also wrote online, under a pen name, about social justice and other issues. “We missed it,” Mr. Robles said. “Shame on us.”
us/politics,Republicans Have One Word for President’s Proposals and Veto Threats: ‘No’  - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  “No” seems to be all anyone wants to say in this town anymore. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama enumerated policies that he opposed, from rolling back Wall Street regulations to exempting more businesses from their obligation to provide health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. To drive home his displeasure with the Republican agenda, the White House also issued two new veto threats in the hours before the president spoke — this time for bills that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and accelerate approval of natural gas pipeline construction. For their part, Republicans immediately rejected most of the proposals that were central to Mr. Obama’s address, saying he was obviously not serious about working with them to pass consequential bipartisan legislation. The midterm elections may have delivered more power to Republicans, who control Congress, but the tenor of the president’s address and the Republican response to it showed there was no new dawn of cooperation. “I think this was a tremendous missed opportunity for this administration,” Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said. “When you start out with multiple veto threats and you show no willingness to even meet somewhere in the middle on issues that have been percolating for some time, it gives you very little hope that there’s going to be a breakthrough.”
us/politics,But in some ways, the Republicans may have the greater burden after promising to prove that they can govern productively after years of being mocked by the president as “the Party of No.” The president’s address signaled not only that he will make that transformation difficult, but also that he and fellow Democrats may adopt a form of the “No” strategy as their own. The parallels may not be exact, of course. Mr. Obama points out that many of the Republicans’ priorities seem designed to provoke him into issuing veto threats because they would dismantle popular pieces of his legacy. Yet, he and Congressional Democrats have to figure out how to assert themselves without becoming subject to the same label they have given Republicans: obstructionists. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, accused the president of offering little more than “warmed-over proposals” and veto threats. Mr. McConnell told reporters that since the fall elections, the president had “almost without exception indicated he’s not for much of anything the American people voted for last November.” Republicans also said that if the president wanted to ensure his legacy, he should strike a far more compromising tone than he did during his address. “I mean what he’s talking about so far he knows doesn’t have any chance whatsoever of passing,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said. “I would think the president in his last two years would actually want to accomplish something. And if he focused on trade and education and cybersecurity, fixing ‘No Child Left Behind,’ making it easier to go to college, all those are areas where we can get some agreement.”
us/politics,But on Tuesday, Republicans were offering few specifics and retreated to their familiar criticisms of Mr. Obama: that he is a tax-and-spend liberal whose policies they could never endorse. “This president, to every problem his solution is, ‘More taxes, more government,’ “ Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said. “The American people made clear the last thing we want is yet more taxes from Washington, more government spending, more debt, more regulations.” Mr. Cruz likened Mr. Obama’s approach to the famous “Saturday Night Live” spoof of the Blue Oyster Cult song “(Don’t Fear) the Reaper.” “To every problem,” Mr. Cruz said, “his solution was, ‘More cowbell! More cowbell!’ “ Republicans said that they were caught off guard by a major component of the president’s 2015 agenda, which he announced over the weekend and detailed further in his speech, to raise taxes and fees on the wealthiest taxpayers and the largest financial firms to pay for, among other things, tax breaks for the middle class and free community college. While these programs may prove popular with many Americans, Republicans said that they hoped the American public would see them as a ploy from a president who knows Congress will never pass them. “It’s the wrong way to approach things,” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, who urged Mr. Obama to focus on “those areas of agreement rather than start talking about things that divide us automatically.” Several Republicans said they had yet to see the White House reach out in a serious way to start building better relationships. And Tuesday’s speech, they said, did not help.
us/politics,“He had a most curious list of where he thought we could work together,” Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, said. “I didn’t understand where he was going with that or what he was trying to do.” Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said, “I’ve seen very little outreach since the November election.” Instead, he said, “It’s been one provocative move after the other.” Some Republicans said they thought the president’s speech and his tone since his party lost badly in the midterm elections signaled that he was interested in seeing little accomplished in the next two years, allowing Democrats in 2016 campaigns to portray Republicans as incompetent stewards of Congress. “For him, it’s all 2016 partisan politics now, and Republicans shouldn’t waste time debating the merits of the president’s political talking points,” Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said. “As the president tries to divide Americans and distract them from the failures of his administration,” Mr. Lee added, “we shouldn’t take the bait.”
health,Dealing With Dementia Among Aging Criminals - The New York Times SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. — Secel Montgomery Sr. stabbed a woman in the stomach, chest and throat so fiercely that he lost count of the wounds he inflicted. In the nearly 25 years he has been serving a life sentence, he has gotten into fights, threatened a prison official and been caught with marijuana. Despite that, he has recently been entrusted with an extraordinary responsibility. He and other convicted killers at the California Men’s Colony help care for prisoners with Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia, assisting ailing inmates with the most intimate tasks: showering, shaving, applying deodorant, even changing adult diapers. Their growing roster of patients includes Joaquin Cruz, a convicted killer who is now so addled that he thinks he sees his brother in the water of a toilet, and Walter Gregory, whose short-term memory is ebbing even as he vividly recalls his crime: stabbing and mutilating his girlfriend with a switchblade. “I cut her eyes out, too,” Mr. Gregory declared recently. Dementia in prison is an underreported but fast-growing phenomenon, one that many prisons are desperately unprepared to handle. It is an unforeseen consequence of get-tough-on-crime policies — long sentences that have created a large population of aging prisoners. About 10 percent of the 1.6 million inmates in America’s prisons are serving life sentences; another 11 percent are serving over 20 years.
health,And more older people are being sent to prison. In 2010, 9,560 people 55 and older were sentenced, more than twice as many as in 1995. In that same period, inmates 55 and older almost quadrupled, to nearly 125,000, a Human Rights Watch report found. While no one has counted cognitively impaired inmates, experts say that prisoners appear more prone to dementia than the general population because they often have more risk factors: limited education, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, depression, substance abuse, even head injuries from fights and other violence. Many states consider over-50 prisoners elderly, saying they age up to 15 years faster. With many prisons already overcrowded and understaffed, inmates with dementia present an especially difficult challenge. They are expensive — medical costs for older inmates range from three to nine times as much as those for younger inmates. They must be protected from predatory prisoners. And because dementia makes them paranoid or confused, feelings exacerbated by the confines of prison, some attack staff members or other inmates, or unwittingly provoke fights by wandering into someone else’s cell. “The dementia population is going to grow tremendously,” says Ronald H. Aday, a sociologist and the author of “Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections.” “How are we going to take care of them?” Some prison systems are confronting that now. Many would like to transfer demented inmates to nursing homes, but their often-violent crimes make states reluctant to parole them and nursing homes reluctant to take them.
health,New York has taken the top-dollar route, establishing a separate unit for cognitively impaired inmates and using professional caregivers, at a cost of about $93,000 per bed annually, compared with $41,000 in the general prison population. Pennsylvania and other states are giving mental health workers special dementia training. But some struggling prison systems, including those in Louisiana and California, are taking a less expensive but potentially riskier approach. They are training prisoners to handle many of the demented inmates’ daily needs. “Yeah, they did something horrible to end up here,” said Cheryl Steed, a psychologist at the California Men’s Colony, where prisoners who help inmates with dementia are called Gold Coats because their yellow jackets contrast with the standard-issue blue. But without them, she said, “we wouldn’t be able to care for our dementia patients very well.” After escorting Joaquin Cruz to an appointment, James Evers, a Gold Coat, was returning him to their adobe-colored cellblock when they encountered corrections officers strip-searching inmates for missing tools. Mr. Cruz, 60, who barely recalls that he is in prison for killing someone who sold him fake cocaine, grew confused and resistant when guards tried searching him. “He has Alzheimer’s,” Mr. Evers managed to explain. “It’s not that he’s refusing to do what you’re asking.”
health,At the prison, shadowed by seacoast mountains, Gold Coats are paid $50 a month and have better knowledge of impaired prisoners’ conditions than many prison guards. Gold Coats, trained by the Alzheimer’s Association and given thick manuals on dementia, were the first to notice when Mr. Cruz began putting his boots on the wrong feet and “started pulling down his pants and going to the bathroom wherever he was,” said Phillip Burdick, a Gold Coat who is serving a life sentence for beating a man to death with a hammer. Gold Coats report these changes, often at weekly support group meetings with Dr. Steed. They identify “different tricks and strategies to get guys to do what they need to do,” she said. Before the program was started in 2009, demented inmates frequently caused fights, hitting those they considered threatening or disturbing other prisoners by encroaching on their turf. “The whole atmosphere was hostile,” said Bettina Hodel, a psychologist who started the program and once narrowly avoided being struck herself. Now, Gold Coats absorb much of that behavior. “I been swung at, got a big fat lip, and my glasses have been broken,” said Ramon Cañas, a Gold Coat who killed a hitchhiker who stole his car. He said Gold Coats — there are currently six of them for about 40 inmates — often wear surgical gloves because they are exposed to “a lot of body fluids.” Protecting the Vulnerable
health,But they also protect demented inmates from prisoners who try assaulting, abusing or robbing them. When Steven Berry, a Gold Coat, caught two inmates picking a demented prisoner’s pockets, he barreled toward them. “Got the stuff back,” reported Mr. Berry, a former Navy signalman who killed his sister-in-law and tried to kill his wife. Gold Coats get harassed and called snitches for seeming to side with prison officials and because of the perks they receive. In the dining hall, to help dementia patients who, as Mr. Burdick says, “start forgetting basic things like what is a spork for,” Gold Coats sit with them at special “slow eater” tables, where meals are allowed to stretch beyond the usual 10 to 12 minutes. When a prisoner tried stealing a patient’s dessert, Mr. Montgomery, one of the Gold Coats, snarled, “You got to give him his cookie back.” “Who are you, the PO-lice?” the inmate barked. Mr. Montgomery retorted, “Yes, I’m the PO-lice!” More inmates have dementia than prison officials realize, experts say. Prison routines can mask symptoms like forgetfulness. Corrections officers are used to punishing aggressive inmates, not evaluating them for Alzheimer’s. “Not responding to questions appropriately, being belligerent — it’s just considered bad behavior,” said Sharen Barboza, director of clinical operations for MHM Services, a prison mental health provider that trains prison officials. New York’s Unit for the Cognitively Impaired, begun five years ago, has so far cared for 84 inmates, but “there’s a number of people in the system that we really haven’t tapped,” said Paul Kleinman, the program’s psychologist. “They’re not being identified properly.”
health,Alzheimer’s currently affects 5.4 million Americans, a number expected to double by 2040. Experts believe that Alzheimer’s disease in prisons could grow two or three times as fast, said John Wilson, senior clinical operations specialist for MHM, because “protective factors that might mitigate developing dementia are slim to none in prison — things like complex jobs, rich social environment, leisure activities.” Realizing that California, with nearly 13,000 inmates 55 and older, could not adequately care for demented prisoners, Dr. Hodel, when she was starting the Gold Coat program, asked the regional chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association to train inmates to help. The chapter’s area director, Sara Bartlett, worried that she and Arlene Stepputat, then the program director, would not be safe as “women in a man’s prison.” She doubted whether violent felons could provide sensitive care. Both women were surprised that inmates seemed more receptive, with less-complicated emotional ties to the patients than many of the people they trained to care for relatives at home. “They were much easier to work with,” Ms. Stepputat said. Heriberto G. Sanchez, chief psychologist of the California Men’s Colony, said prisoners “were appreciative that someone from the outside world thought they could do this.” One wrote in an evaluation, “Thank you for allowing me to feel human.” The prison requires that Gold Coats have “a clean behavior record for about 5 to 10 years,” Dr. Steed said. So far, only one Gold Coat has been removed, because “he had problems” with dementia patients’ messy eating and other behaviors, Dr. Hodel said.
health,For inmates, the job has attractions. It pays better than other prison work and polishes a prisoner’s record. Two Gold Coats have received parole. One of them, Shawn Henderson, who got 25 years to life for a 1985 double murder and was twice denied parole, was released last February. Doing a job where “you get spit on, feces thrown on you, urine on you, you get cursed out” helped teach him to cope outside prison, said Mr. Henderson, 46. “Now when I come into an encounter like that on the street, I can be a lot more compassionate,” he said. “And I don’t look at telling authorities as snitching anymore.” Gold Coats conduct exercise classes and run meetings designed to stimulate memory and lessen disorientation. They escort inmates to doctors, acting as their intermediaries. And they often need to be deft. One 73-year-old inmate stands by a gate most mornings, waiting for his long-dead mother to pick him up. Sometimes he refuses to shower, afraid of missing her. Mr. Evers coaxes him inside, telling him that his mother “wants you to shower before she gets here.” More subtlety is required for Mr. Gregory, 71, who is serving a life sentence for brutalizing his girlfriend with a switchblade — throwing her body parts in the trash and getting caught, he said, when “I went right back to the room that I killed her in and had sex with another” woman. He does not believe he has dementia, but his gradually accumulating symptoms include breaking a mop over an inmate’s head and writing to outside agencies under the delusion that he will be granted parole.
health,To assist Mr. Gregory, Samuel Baxter, a Gold Coat who fatally shot a co-worker, firing six times, gently reminds him about bed making and schedules. “You have to allow Mr. Gregory to come to you,” Mr. Baxter said. There are limits to what Gold Coats can do. They can file patients’ fingernails, for instance, but not clip them because that constitutes a professional caregiving responsibility that cannot legally be delegated to inmates. And there are indignities, like cleaning up after inmates who urinate on the floor. “A year ago,” Mr. Baxter said, “I couldn’t have said, ‘You know what man, I’m going to go help this grown man get in the shower,’ ” and “get in there and help these guys wash theirself off.” Gold Coats say they are moved by the work. “I’m a person who was broken,” said Mr. Burdick, who during 35 years in prison lost a wife to AIDS and a 16-year-old daughter to suicide. Dementia patients often “don’t even say thank you,” he said, but “they just pat me like that and I know what that means.” Mr. Cañas said: “I didn’t have any feelings about other people. I mean, in that way, I was a predator.” Now, he said, “I’m a protector.” Still, the Gold Coats have not figured out how to help Leon Baham. When Mr. Baham, 71, received a dementia diagnosis a year ago, a psychiatrist, Dr. Russell Marks, noted that he pined for his wife “almost as though at moments he didn’t realize” that his crime had been “murdering the woman he was tearful about.”
health,In a recent interview, Mr. Baham recalled the murder hazily: “Blood everywhere. She said, ‘Sweetheart.’ ” He has repeatedly been placed in the crisis center, once after “he urinated on the floor, he was banging his head on the cage, he needed a spit mask to prevent his spitting on others,” and he was “threatening to kill persons that he believed stole his watch,” Dr. Marks said. After trying to enter the wrong cell, he told Dr. Steed, “I’m going to kill myself,” adding, “I don’t want to live this way.” He was sent to a psychiatric hospital, returning less depressed. But he often sits confused in the yard. “I forget why I was going out there,” Mr. Baham said. “I’m slipping a little bit.” Still, he resists the Gold Coats’ help and believes that he would have to pay them. Oblique assistance, like Mr. Burdick bringing him a jacket, is all he accepts so far. “I don’t need them, you know,” Mr. Baham said. ‘I Was a Monster’ The compassion Secel Montgomery is required to show in his job as a Gold Coat was nowhere to be seen in the killing he committed in 1987. He wanted money for alcohol, and when his former sister-in-law refused, “I knocked her unconscious, tied her up and stabbed her.” Then he washed his hands and called his wife for a ride. He grabbed things that had his fingerprints on them, but left his infant nephew there alone. “I figured that’s kidnapping,” he explained.
health,Mr. Montgomery, sentenced to 26 years to life, spent 17 years in a high-security prison for “disobeying orders,” he said. He made contraband alcohol called “pruno.” Only in 2000, after Mr. Montgomery, 47, was found with marijuana, accused of threatening a prison official and locked in the “hole,” did he decide to change. “I was a monster,” he said. Families of demented inmates seem unperturbed that prisoners like Mr. Montgomery now have so much responsibility. Laura Eklund, Mr. Cruz’s niece, said prison officials have asked if his relatives wanted him paroled, but the family has declined. “To be honest, the care he’s receiving in prison, we could not match,” she said. When Mr. Cruz spies his own reflection, he often believes it is his brother Sergio. To keep him from getting agitated, his cell mirror has been covered with tape. But now when he looks into a toilet, he calls: “Hey, my brother, he’s down there. I can’t get him out.” Mr. Montgomery said he tries to reassure Mr. Cruz, but if Mr. Cruz is locked in his cell, Mr. Montgomery — still a prisoner, after all — cannot enter even if he is allowed out of his own cell. He will call to Mr. Cruz through a tiny window in the thick metal door. “All I can do is say, ‘Cruz, come here, come here, come here,’ but he’ll stand there,” staring helplessly into the toilet and agonizing. “ ‘See, see, look, see.’ ”
us/politics,New Hampshire Takeaways: Trust, Experience and Message Count - The New York Times MANCHESTER, N.H. — More than half a million voters cast ballots in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, rewarding Donald J. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont with resounding victories, and sending some candidates home to rethink their campaigns. But the results also tell much about the electorate and the challenges the contenders face going forward. Here are some key takeaways from the nation’s first primary: Among voters who cared most about honesty and trustworthiness, 91 percent chose Mr. Sanders and only 5 percent chose Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. She fared only slightly better among voters who wanted candidates who seemed to care most about people like them. And the younger the voters, the more skeptical they were of Mrs. Clinton: She received just 16 percent of the support from people under 29, and 32 percent from those 30 to 44. The only age group she won: voters over 65. While pollsters have repeatedly identified Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness as a concern of voters, Clinton advisers have long hoped that even if people did not trust her personally, they would come to trust that she would fight for their needs. She clearly still has work to do on that front. Some of her allies, looking back on the race so far, rue that she did not apologize months earlier for using private email when she was secretary of state. They fear that a sense of mistrust became baked into the electorate before she contained the controversy.
us/politics,While Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders positioned themselves as political outsiders and won big, the establishment was not entirely demolished. Sixty-nine percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the next president to have experience in politics, and they narrowly favored Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls. Forty-five percent of Republicans said they preferred a president with political experience, and those voters favored Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, followed by former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. Mrs. Clinton has been emphasizing her government experience for months. But, according to advisers, she thinks it will start working to her advantage in the coming contests in states where many voters know little about Mr. Sanders or whether he is qualified to be president. Mr. Kasich and Mr. Bush, in turn, are likely to hold up their records as governors to draw contrasts with Mr. Trump in the next primary, in South Carolina, where many Republican voters say they respect candidates who have served in public office. It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the New Hampshire loss for Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. The state was a political bellwether for Mr. Clinton, putting him on the path toward the Democratic nomination in 1992 and backing him in the general elections that year and in 1996.
us/politics,Voters again came through in a big way in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton won here and revived her candidacy after losing the Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama and John Edwards. But on Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton lost New Hampshire’s big cities: Concord, Manchester and Nashua. She lost most of the small towns. She lost in the north country and the seacoast, along the western border and through the White Mountains. She lost many major demographic groups, performing best among the older and wealthier, and among people who care about experience and electability in November. But these voters were small in number compared with Mr. Sanders’s legions. Mrs. Clinton won 112,404 votes in New Hampshire in 2008 in a tough race against Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards; on Tuesday, she won 95,249 votes to Mr. Sanders’s 151,578. The presidential debates have been high-octane, high-ratings and highly entertaining affairs, but they were not seriously damaging to a candidate until a revelatory performance by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Saturday, just three days before the New Hampshire primary. As Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey attacked Mr. Rubio as a typical Washington politician who spoke in scripted sound bites, Mr. Rubio reinforced that image by repeating the same lines about President Obama’s determination to change the United States.
us/politics,It suddenly seemed as if Mr. Rubio, a first-term, 44-year-old senator, did not have an original thought in the world. He hurt himself further on Monday as he deplored 21st-century cultural forces and “the values they try to ram down our throats” — and then repeated the same phrase a few seconds later. Mr. Rubio, who had been rising in the polls before the debate, was sliding toward a fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary as final returns were tallied. “I did not do well on Saturday night,” Mr. Rubio said at his primary-night party on Tuesday. “Listen to this: That will never happen again. That will never happen again.” In the 2008 Democratic primaries, Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Obama in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and other states partly because of solid support from working-class white voters. But Mr. Sanders prevailed with these voters in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Sixty-eight percent of white noncollege graduates supported him, as did 65 percent of people from families earning less than $50,000. On the Republican side, the same groups of voters broke strongly for Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton says she thinks she can still win back these voters with her policy proposals for paid family leave and for capping prescription drug costs for some Americans, but so far she has not performed well with less affluent voters in New Hampshire or Iowa.
us/politics,Mr. Trump led in many Iowa polls before the Feb. 1 caucuses, but he came in second place when it came time for the actual voting. That result raised questions about whether all the people crowding into Trump rallies were true-blue supporters or celebrity worshipers. But on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump’s supporters proved that they were committed and enthusiastic enough to turn out for their candidate. He won among first-time voters in a Republican primary, as expected. But he also won among Republicans, independents and people who have voted in past party primaries. He did especially well with voters who preferred candidates who “tell it like it is.” But he lost to Mr. Kasich, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Mr. Bush among voters who wanted a candidate who “shares my values.” In the end, Mr. Trump won 30 to 40 percent of the vote among many demographic groups, showing that he can win primaries and caucuses when a large Republican field splits the vote. Something went wrong between Mrs. Clinton and the women of New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders won 55 percent of their votes compared with Mrs. Clinton’s 44 percent, with married women and especially unmarried women breaking his way, according to exit polls. Those results rocked the Clinton campaign, given that Mrs. Clinton is running to become the first female president and enjoyed the support of many of the most powerful women in the state, including its governor and its Democratic senator. Moreover, women provided the margin of victory for Mrs. Clinton in her 2008 primary victory here.
us/politics,Clinton advisers are confident that her support will rebound with women in Nevada, South Carolina and the Super Tuesday states that vote on March 1. But some of Mrs. Clinton’s friends are nervous: They did not expect her to lose New Hampshire so badly, and for women to be such a big factor in her defeat. Mr. Trump struck a chord with Republican primary voters on many issues, but particularly where Muslims and illegal immigrants were concerned. Sixty-four percent of voters said they supported temporarily barring Muslims from entering the country if they are not citizens, and 44 percent of those voters backed Mr. Trump. Forty-one percent of voters said that illegal immigrants should be deported to the countries where they came from — and 50 percent of them supported Mr. Trump. No other Republican candidate came close with the New Hampshire residents who held these views. Voters who chose candidates at the last minute — on Primary Day itself — broke narrowly for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. But Mr. Kasich was the top pick of voters who chose their Republican favorite over the last few days, suggesting he may have benefited from Mr. Rubio’s poor debate performance on Saturday night. Among Democratic voters who made up their minds in the last few days, Mr. Sanders did better.
us/politics,The candidates who fared best in New Hampshire — Mr. Sanders, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kasich — all offered easily understood, well-communicated messages. While other candidates struggled to refine their pitches, Mr. Trump repeated his vow to build a wall on the nation’s southern border, Mr. Sanders once again railed against Wall Street, and Mr. Kasich promised to unify Americans of all parties and backgrounds. It helped that the messengers, in all three cases, came across as authentic advocates of their positions.
world/asia,For $14.50, Afghan Refugees Make a Desperate Bet on a Way Out - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — The winding road to Germany starts on the outskirts of Kabul, at the Ahmad Shah Baba bus depot. This is where some of the youngest and poorest Afghans hoping to migrate to Europe gather each day to leave. If they carry a backpack at all, it is usually slack, with little inside. Some have begun hearing that there is one country eager to have them. “I am trying to go to Germany,” Abdul Javed, 16, said after buying a bus ticket. “Hopefully I will pass this test and get there.” He stood in the depot’s small office, where a red carpet had been thrown over the counter so passengers could rest their elbows as they counted out their cash. The ticket agent, Rahmatullah, says he does not have a bus headed all the way to Munich. But the equivalent of $14.50 secures a seat on the first leg of the journey, to Nimruz, a desolate province along Afghanistan’s border with Iran. Until last year most of the teenagers headed toward Nimruz wanted to go no farther than Iran, to seek work as laborers. But these days, the province is better known as the first stop on the path to Europe. Now some 40 buses depart each day to Nimruz, according to ticket agents from a range of bus companies in Kabul.
world/asia,The Ahmad Shah Baba service is among the most popular, having gained a reputation for fast and reckless driving that can finish the journey in 12 hours. When Rahmatullah thinks of how many people are leaving Afghanistan — every ticket he sells is a reminder — he feels wonder and sadness. “There were never this many people leaving until now,” he said. For a generation, Afghans had been the largest group of refugees in the world, other than Palestinians. Last year, the number of Afghan refugees was overtaken by fleeing Syrians. Yet Afghans are leaving at an accelerated rate. Through July, about 77,700 Afghans had reached Turkey and Europe and applied for asylum this year, compared with 58,500 for all of 2014, according to data from the United Nations. And after Syrians, Afghans make up the largest group of the more than 381,000 people to have arrived in Europe by sea this year. Many young Afghans feel a gloom settling over their future, as well as their country’s. The Taliban are gaining more territory. The departure of foreign troops and organizations has left behind a shrunken economy. The new government, now almost a year old, has done little that anyone can recall. “Some time ago, we entered into the dark ages,” said Aynullah, who sells bus tickets from a stall along the crowded highway that leads south out of Kabul, toward Kandahar, and then swoops west to Nimruz. Of all the routes to Europe, this is among the worst.
world/asia,Any Afghan who can afford a flight to Turkey will take it and pick up the trail from there, avoiding Iran. The border police in Iran sometimes shoot at Afghans crossing the desert, migrants and Afghan officials said. “There have been weeks where we have had 44 corpses sent back across the border,” Amir Mohammad Akhundzada, the former governor of Nimruz, said this year. “The bodies were of people who had been in accidents, or hanged for smuggling, or shot while crossing. We are facing a major crisis.” Those who get to Turkey through Iran often join fleeing Syrians and Iraqis heading across the sea to Greece and then up through the Balkans. But most do not make it far beyond the border of Iran, at least not on their first try. The odds of success become clear most days at 5 p.m., when the return buses from Nimruz start to roll into the depot. On a recent afternoon, one of the last passengers to stagger off a bus from Nimruz was 18-year-old Rehanullah, his face sallow from dehydration and hunger. Rehanullah, who like many Afghans uses a single name, had set out from Kabul eight days earlier. “I didn’t have a particular country in mind — I just wanted to go,” he said. He had grown up in Jalalabad, in Afghanistan’s east, where he worked in a mechanics shop, earning little. The war had touched his family: An older brother was killed three years ago.
world/asia,“I believe Europe will treat us as humans,” he said. But here, “I have nothing in my hand — nothing.” Rehanullah recalled his father’s words to him before he left home: “Yes, there is no future here. If you want to go, go.” He had set out with the equivalent of $65 in the pocket of his blue shalwar kameez, the traditional, loosefitting clothing of Afghanistan. In his backpack, he carried a pair of jeans and a T-shirt he would change into once Afghanistan was far behind him. He never got the chance. In Nimruz, he met a smuggler who agreed to ferry him across the border. An impossible number of people squeezed into a Toyota Corolla, Rehanullah said, explaining that he was one of four in the trunk. The next thing he knew, the car had stopped and other passengers were bleeding. The police had fired on the car, killing two people with him, he said. After a day in jail, he was deported. He made it back to Kabul, only after persuading the bus driver to let him on for free. “I begged the driver for half an hour.” It is the sort of story that is not unusual to hear as the return buses arrive. But the pessimism of the passengers lingers in the bus depot for only as long as it takes everyone to disperse. The rest of the day, it is as though the people at the bus depot are bound by some communal decision to be optimistic, and they all keep worries to themselves.
world/asia,At the depot’s entrance, a group of young men squatted, discussing the price of a ticket. Sher Mohammad, one of the bus drivers, watched them with a touch of pity. “Look at them,” he said. “All are 16, 17, 18, 19.” “They are boys,” Mr. Mohammad said, “and they think they will have a better life — and their parents encourage them to leave.” Rahmatullah, the ticket agent, often sells enough tickets in a day to fill up two, sometimes three buses, each with 57 seats. But soon, he said, he may sell his last ticket and board a bus himself, heading toward Germany, by way of Nimruz. He knows the odds better than anyone, but he makes the equivalent of only $11 a day, not nearly enough to skip Iran by flying to Turkey. “It’s too dangerous to go by road, but I can’t afford air travel,” he said. “God willing, I will go soon.”

upshot,Q. and A. About Student Debt - The New York Times Dire warnings about student debt have become so common that many people may have a hard time believing that the problem is often exaggerated, as I wrote in my column Tuesday. Sure enough, readers raised several thoughtful questions about the research in the column, which found that large student debts are rarer than widely believed. I asked Beth Akers and Matthew Chingos, the Brookings Institution fellows who did the research, some of those questions via email. Our exchange appears below. Q: Your own numbers show that student debt has risen since the 1990s, so do you agree the problem has become worse? A: Increases in debt do not necessarily indicate a problem, but rather are tied to how much students pay for college and whether they are able to (and choose to) pay their college costs up front or finance them with debt. Debt is only a problem insofar as it is used to finance investments that don’t pay off. And the data tell us that college does pay off, on average. This means that the increased lifetime earnings associated with a college degree outweigh the costs, regardless of whether they are paid up front or financed with debt. Q: One reason that debt payments, as a share of income, haven’t risen is that loan-repayment periods are longer now. Does that suggest debt is a bigger burden on people than it was?
upshot,A: Because the average payment period has become longer, flat (or declining) payment-to-income ratios alone do not indicate that the long run burden of debt has not increased. However, we also show evidence that suggests that lifetime income has increased by more than debt, leaving borrowers with a reduced burden relative to their income in the long run, on average. The typical borrower in 2010 had more debt than the typical borrower 20 years prior, but also more money with which to pay back that debt. Q: You report that in 1992, 14 percent of households had debt and made a median monthly payment equal to 4 percent of their income. In 2010, the median monthly payment was still 4 percent of income, but this burden was shouldered by 36 percent of households. Doesn’t this represent a significant increase in the aggregate debt burden faced by society and raise the possibility that debt is having a bigger drag on the economy? A: Yes, it does. If student-loan debt causes households to reduce consumption, perhaps by delaying the purchase of a home, then a large increase in the share of households with debt could have negative implications for the macro economy. However, existing research is inconclusive as to whether this is the case and it’s hard to make the argument that it’s true given the body of evidence indicating large financial returns to higher education.
upshot,For example, a widely cited blog post from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that the rate of homeownership among individuals with student loan debt had fallen below the rate among those without education debt. However, one of us looked at data over a longer period of time and found that this was actually a return to a pattern that was evident in the 1990s. This highlights the difficulty of measuring the causal impact of debt on a variety of outcomes, as well as the need for more rigorous research on this subject. Q: Because you looked at households, your analysis excluded some college graduates still living with their parents, correct? Walk us through your thinking here. A: If young graduates living with their families are considered financially dependent on their parents, they would be included in their parents’ household and would probably not be included in the analysis due to the age restriction. If they are considered financially independent, they would also be considered part of their parents’ household (and thus could not be sampled as a separate household).
upshot,In any case, we think it is unlikely this has a significant impact on our analysis. Data from the Department of Education show that the percent of bachelor’s degree recipients living with family one year following graduation was 27 percent in both 1994 and 2009. Census data on all adults ages 18 to 31, a wider group that includes college students and those with no college education, indicate that the share living at home with parents was stable at around 32 percent between 1981 and 2007, but increased somewhat to 36 percent by 2012. Given the stability in these numbers over the period examined in our study (1989 through 2010), we think it is unlikely that the exclusion of debt held by adult children living with their parents has a significant effect on our analysis of changes in student debt over time. Q: Some of your analyses exclude borrowers who are not making monthly payments, such as those in deferral. Can you explain what that means for your results? A: Nearly all of our analysis includes all young households, with a focus on those with education debt. The one exception is our examination of monthly payment-to-income ratios, which excludes borrowers that were not making payments on their loans. If we include these borrowers, we get very similar results. Note that this also makes the average debt-burden ratio smaller because we are averaging in zero payments.
upshot,We also exclude borrowers with less than $1,000 in annual wage income, but obtain very similar results if we include borrowers with more than $0 but less than $1,000 in income. We still have to exclude borrowers with zero wage income, because their payment-to-income ratio is not defined, but the share of borrowers with no wage income has not exhibited a clear trend between 1992 and 2010. It was 7 percent in 1992 and 8 percent in 2010, with a decrease during some of the years in between. Q: That’s an important point. There is no one perfect way to look at these numbers. To take another example we discussed, if you include people who don’t have any education debt, you see a larger percentage rise in student debt since the early 1990s — but you also see an even smaller fraction of the population with large debts. By that measure, only 3 percent of young-adult households have student debt of at least $50,000, rather than 7 percent I reported. (The number I used was based only on those households with at least some debt.) Next question: Are your results consistent with data on student loan defaults? They’re rising, yes?
upshot,A: Default is a measure of extreme financial hardship that can also reflect borrower behavior. For example, borrowers of federal loans who face unaffordable monthly payments should be eligible for income-based repayment options, but may not know this (or may choose not to participate) and default as a result. This makes default a noisy measure of the burden of debt. For the purposes of our study, we think that examining debt and income levels provides a more complete picture of the financial health of a wide range of borrowers. The fact that defaults are rising warrants further study, but it doesn’t say nearly as much about most people’s experiences as the overall data on student debt. Q: You look at households led by adults between the ages of 20 and 40, which has the advantage of creating a larger sample and describing the experiences of more people. But do you think it might obscure patterns for more recent college graduates? A: Our report is focused on the health of the market for education debt among relatively young households. Focusing on recent college graduates would be difficult given that students graduate from college at a range of ages and the Survey of Consumer Finances does not identify when respondents graduated from college. Focusing on relatively young borrowers would miss graduates who attended college at later ages, as well as recipients of graduate degrees, an important component of our analysis. Consequently, we believe our approach was the most appropriate one for the research question we were addressing and the data available.
upshot,Q: I’d add that other data, which does focus on more recent college graduates, shows a broadly similar picture. For examples, only 5 percent of bachelor’s-degree holders who started college in 2003-04 had borrowed at least $50,000 by 2009, according to the College Board. By comparison, 84 percent had borrowed less than $20,000. It’s not as if other data sets suggest that $50,000 or $75,000 in student debt is typical. When do you expect that more recent data from the Survey of Consumer Finances will be available? A: Nationally representative data like the Survey of Consumer Finances are always backward looking, and as a result could miss very recent trends. Most would agree that the economy has improved since 2010, so we think it’s unlikely that the data paint an overly optimistic picture of the financial well-being of households. We’ll know more when the 2013 data are released, which should happen this fall. For people interested in more detail on these topics, I suggest, among other things, two articles by Matt Phillips of Quartz; a Peter Coy article in Bloomberg Businessweek; and a less recent, though still relevant, interview with Sandy Baum, an economist now with George Washington University.

sports/baseball,Alex Rodriguez to Retire and Join Yankees as an Adviser - The New York Times Wednesday morning, not long after a struggling Alex Rodriguez had made the final out in a loss to the Mets, Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ managing general partner, sent him a text message: It was time, he said, for them to speak face to face. Later that day, they did, in a room off the clubhouse in Yankee Stadium. And it was there that Steinbrenner told Rodriguez, 41, that there would be no more at-bats for him as a Yankee, not this season or the next one, either, when he would be in the last year of his enormous $275 million contract. It was no secret, Steinbrenner told Rodriguez, that the Yankees had made a significant change of course and were now looking to the future. A fading slugger hitting .204 this season simply did not fit in. Later that day, Steinbrenner and Rodriguez met again. On Thursday morning, there was a third session. And by then, Steinbrenner also had a proposal for Rodriguez to consider: Instead of sitting on the bench for the rest of the season, doing nothing, Rodriguez would be given his release by the Yankees and then appointed a special adviser and instructor for the club. He would get the $27 million still owed him for this season and for 2017, but he would no longer be playing.
sports/baseball,For Steinbrenner, the proposal was a way to get something positive out of the money the Yankees still owed Rodriguez and to keep things on good terms with a player with whom the team had had far too many recriminations in the past. The other course of action — simply not playing him again in 2016 and then unceremoniously cutting him loose — had the potential to anger Rodriguez and lead to more unhappy headlines. Later that day, Rodriguez told Steinbrenner he needed a couple of days to mull it over, and on Saturday he accepted the offer. Then, on Sunday, in a tearful news conference at Yankee Stadium to announce his decision, Rodriguez said he had taken it to mean that his remarkable playing career would end this Friday, when the Yankees play at home against Tampa Bay. “The last four weeks have not been fun,” Rodriguez said. “It’s been very painful and embarrassing to sit on the bench. It’s been awkward. So, from that sense, I’m very happy that we found a solution.” Although it is always possible that some other team, at some point, may ask Rodriguez if he would like one more shot at playing, the game on Friday appears set to be his final one after 22 seasons, a number of which he spent as, perhaps, the best player in the game. He won three American League Most Valuable Player Awards over the course of his career and has more than 3,000 hits and nearly 700 home runs. However, he also left himself with a legacy as one of the game’s most notorious users of performance-enhancing drugs.
sports/baseball,As with almost everything involving Rodriguez’s dozen seasons in New York, his departure will be a little complicated. Had he simply announced that he was retiring, no strings attached, the Yankees would not have had to pay him the money still owed him under his contract. By instead giving him his unconditional release, they will have to do so. After his release, Rodriguez will then sign a new contract for his adviser role that will pay him a small amount in addition to the $27 million he was already owed. That contract will run through December 2017, when his current 10-year deal with the team would have ended anyway. Financially, at least, Rodriguez is coming out ahead. “He can negotiate the heck out of it,” General Manager Brian Cashman said of Rodriguez’s discussions with Steinbrenner in recent days. “He negotiated probably the greatest sports contract in the history of sports, so he has a lot of gifts. He doesn’t just play baseball.” For Rodriguez, who will head home to Miami after Friday’s game and take up his new responsibilities in spring training, the choice was clear: Hang on stubbornly through the rest of this season, be released and then try to catch on with another club for 2017, or accept the Yankees’ offer and remain in the good graces of a team he loves being associated with. Given those two options, Rodriguez chose to stay put.
sports/baseball,“I was incredibly humbled and flattered that he wanted me to spend time with the next generation of Yankees,” Rodriguez said of Steinbrenner. “That’s a role I’ve enjoyed my entire career.’’ Cashman has long regarded Rodriguez as someone who can be a good mentor to other players and a skilled evaluator. He noted that Rodriguez had once told him about a promising high school player named Manny Machado, now an All-Star with the Baltimore Orioles, and had come away from a minor league rehabilitation assignment raving over Greg Bird, the Yankees’ top hitting prospect. “He loves that aspect of the game,” Cashman said. “I think he wants to be an owner one day, but anything below that in a field uniform, he’s already plug ’n’ play. He’s exceptional on the baseball end in terms of the teaching and evaluating side. He always has been.” Cashman said that Rodriguez would remain free to do broadcast work and that, should a team at some point seek his services as a player, the Yankees would not stand in the way. But Cashman seemed skeptical as to whether that might happen. Meanwhile, Rodriguez sounded like a man who had accepted that his final game was less than a week away. “This is a tough day,” he said in words he acknowledged had been prepared the night before. “I love this game, and I love this team, and today I am saying goodbye to both.”
sports/baseball,Rodriguez spent 13 years with the Yankees, who acquired him in a blockbuster deal in February 2004 that sent Alfonso Soriano to the Texas Rangers in exchange. He went on to win two of his three M.V.P. Awards in pinstripes, but few days went by without Rodriguez creating distractions with some type of malfeasance, whether it was his strained relationship with his teammate Derek Jeter, the revelations of Rodriguez’s drug use or his notable failures in numerous Yankee postseasons. Still, the Yankees and Rodriguez now think that his flaws, along with his accomplishments, can be turned into assets in his work with young players. “A guy like me who has been to hell and back and made every mistake in the book, I think they can learn equally from all the mistakes that I’ve made and hopefully not make them,” he said. Three years ago, the notion that the Yankees would even consider Rodriguez for the role they are now giving him would have been ridiculed. At the time, he was at war with the organization and with Major League Baseball over his alleged links to the Biogenesis doping scandal. Rodriguez filed several lawsuits and at first battled the record suspension that was levied against him in August 2013 by Commissioner Bud Selig, but he ultimately relented. He accepted a ban for all of 2014; made peace with baseball’s incoming commissioner, Rob Manfred; and returned to the Yankees in 2015 as a contrite and dedicated teammate.
sports/baseball,To considerable surprise, he also slugged 33 home runs last season and drove in 86 runs. But this season, his numbers dwindled sharply. Through Sunday, he was batting just .204 with nine home runs and 29 R.B.I. He also has 696 career homers, which means that by departing now, he will almost certainly fall short of 700 — a figure only Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds have surpassed. Still, Rodriguez said he was at peace with his decision, and with his place in baseball history. “I do want to be remembered as someone who was madly in love with the game of baseball,” he said, and then added, “I also will hopefully be remembered as someone who tripped and fell a lot, but kept getting up.”

upshot,Freezing Eggs as Part of Employee Benefits: Some Women See Darker Message - The New York Times Tech companies are famous for their lavish benefits, like in-office haircuts, dry cleaning and massages. Now some of those companies are setting off a debate about women and work with a new benefit — paying for women on the payroll to freeze their eggs. Facebook in January began covering up to $20,000 in egg freezing expenses, and Apple said it would start covering egg freezing this January, as first reported by NBC News. Some doctors say egg freezing could be as influential as the birth control pill in freeing women from the confines of biology. Childbirth coincides with prime career-building years, and balancing both is a perpetual challenge. The cover of Bloomberg Businessweek in April blared, “Freeze Your Eggs, Free Your Career.” Yet by paying for women to delay pregnancy, are employers helping them achieve that balance — or avoiding policies that experts agree would greatly help solve the problem, like paid family leave, child care and flexible work arrangements? “Egg freezing seems to put a Band-Aid on the problem of how difficult it is for women to have a career and raise a family concurrently,” Seema Mohapatra, a health care law and bioethics expert, wrote in August in a Harvard Law & Policy Review article titled “Using Egg Freezing to Extend the Biological Clock: Fertility Insurance or False Hope?”
upshot,For women whose circumstances have made it unrealistic to have a baby and who are considering egg freezing, the new benefit is likely to be a highly welcome surprise — even if in some sense it may seem a logical extension of employee-sponsored health plans that already cover pregnancy, childbirth and some infertility treatments. Yet workplaces could be seen as paying women to put off childbearing. Women who choose to have babies earlier could be stigmatized as uncommitted to their careers. Just as tech company benefits like free food and dry cleaning serve to keep employees at the office longer, so could egg freezing, by delaying maternity leave and child-care responsibilities. “It is certainly in the employer’s interest to delay fertility for these women, from a business perspective,” said a woman who froze her eggs but would discuss it only anonymously. “But in my experience, it’s more personal: Are you married or not married, and if you’re not and you’re over 35, it’s a health thing.” Her employer did not cover her egg freezing, which she said “kind of punishes unmarried women.” Ms. Mohapatra, a law professor at Barry University School of Law in Orlando, Fla., said women who do not fit that profile could feel pressured to use the benefit. “What I worry about is it’s not going to be just used by that population,” she said in an interview, “but is going to be used by the population in their 20s and early 30s saying, ‘If I want to be seen as a serious employee and make it to vice president, I can’t take maternity leave. They’re offering this insurance policy to me or else I’ll be deemed as being on the mommy track.'  ”
upshot,The tech companies emphasized that egg preservation was one of many family-friendly benefits they offered employees, which include perks like baby bonuses to spend on diapers and meals and benefits for adoptive and same-sex parents. “We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families,” the company said in a statement. Egg freezing has been available for more than a decade, but it had been used mostly for preserving eggs for young cancer patients whose chemotherapy would make them infertile. That changed in late 2012, when the American Society of Reproductive Medicine lifted the “experimental” label from the procedure after analyzing nearly 1,000 published papers and concluding it could produce healthy babies. However, the group warned that it is more reliable for women who are younger when they freeze their eggs and that there is not yet strong data on its success. It stopped short of recommending the procedure for elective reasons. “While a careful review of the literature indicates egg freezing is a valid technique for young women for whom it is medically indicated, we cannot at this time endorse its widespread elective use to delay childbearing,” Dr. Samantha Pfeifer, chairwoman of the society’s practice committee, said at the time. “This technology may not be appropriate for the older woman who desires to postpone reproduction.”
upshot,Doctors estimate there have been about 2,000 births from frozen eggs, though there is no official data. Women who freeze their eggs when they are younger than 35 have a 10 percent to 12 percent chance of giving birth per egg, and women who do it when they are older than 35 have a 6 percent to 8 percent chance or lower, said Marcelle Cedars, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of California, San Francisco. Women are advised to harvest and freeze 10 to 20 eggs. “I spend a lot of time talking with couples who go through this to tell them it’s not a guarantee; it’s not a baby in the freezer,” Dr. Cedars said. “If you’re ready to have a child, then you should do it. This is just giving women an opportunity that men have always had, to say, ‘I’m not really ready right now and I’m going to wait.'  ” Egg freezing is a two-week process involving hormone injections and extraction under sedation, and it takes another two weeks to feel back to normal, Dr. Cedars said. A cycle usually costs $10,000 to $15,000, and many women are encouraged to do more than one cycle to harvest more eggs. Storage costs about $500 a year. Insurance very rarely covers it, though there are also companies outside of tech, like some investment banks and law firms, that do.
upshot,There are class and race divides in egg freezing. A planned pregnancy later in life is much more realistic for highly educated, high-income women, according to June Carbone and Naomi Cahn, law professors who write about the gender and class divide in reproduction — in other words, the kind of people who work at Facebook and Apple. Working-class women are less likely to be able to afford egg freezing; or to be employed during pregnancy; or to receive paid maternity leave. If other white-collar companies follow tech’s lead in offering egg freezing, as they have with other benefits that started in Silicon Valley, that divide could deepen as more women consider the opportunity, or fraught message, when deciding when to start a family.
business/energy-environment,After Fukushima, Does Nuclear Power Have a Future? - The New York Times A couple of months after the catastrophe at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant March 11, an American nuclear expert posed an interesting question. “The post-Fukushima public sentiment is surprisingly low-key isn’t it? What a difference between this event and TMI or Chernobyl,” he wrote in an e-mail, using an abbreviation for the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. “What do you think is going on? Why so quiet?” I was not convinced. What he said was certainly true in the United States, but the accident had a profound effect in Germany, China and several other countries, serving as a fearful reminder of what can go wrong with nuclear power plants. Phase-outs were the order of the day in Germany (where Chancellor Angela Merkel also demanded immediate shutdowns of eight of the country’s oldest reactors) and Switzerland. China suspended approvals for new reactors pending a safety review, which is now reportedly completed. This has resulted in a downward revision of China’s unofficial pre-Fukushima goal to install 86 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2020. It now looks like that will be set around 60 gigawatts (up from around 12 currently) or just a little higher. Italy said no to new reactors for the second time, ending a relatively brief flirtation with nuclear planners after a long post-Chernobyl freeze. “I think there is now less than 0.01 percent chance for nuclear in Italy,” said Luigi De Paoli, energy economy professor at the Bocconi University in Milan, according to Reuters.
business/energy-environment,Taiwan appears on the brink of some kind of phase-out involving four reactors, although it is likely to allow a recently constructed fifth unit to operate. Venezuela and Israel, both countries that had harbored nuclear power ambitions, decided they could do without after all. “I think we’ll go for the gas,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN. “I think we’ll skip the nuclear.” In Japan, of course, the effect was most dramatic. Thirteen units were automatically “scrammed” when the earthquake struck, and a 14th was already out for maintenance. With 15 others offline because of previous quakes or for mandatory inspection and refueling, the country’s fleet of 54 operating reactors was cut to 25. In May, the government ordered a shutdown of three additional units (one of which had already been down for maintenance) at Hamaoka, situated in a particularly vulnerable seismic zone near Tokyo. The nuclear “capacity factor” — a measure of how much electricity reactors generate as a percentage of what they could provide — had dropped precipitously, from 71 percent in February to 51 percent in May, but it would plunge even further in subsequent months. Facing the prospect of broad electricity failures over the summer, Japan’s leadership did not dare order more plants shut down, but it hardly needed to. Because of the requirement for inspections every 13 months, more reactors were taken offline, one after the other. Now only 11 are operating. (The Japan Atomic Industrial Forum stopped publishing monthly capacity factors after July, when the figure stood at 34 percent, with 19 units operating.) While there certainly were electricity shortages, Japan survived the summer without the extensive blackouts that had been predicted.
business/energy-environment,Normally the reactors would have been restarted within several weeks of shutdown, but these are not normal times in Japan. Restarts require approvals from local and prefectural governments, and these have not been received since the disaster. The 11 reactors still in operation are due to go down for maintenance between now and next September, and that in theory could leave Japan with zero nuclear-generated electricity — although that is unlikely, given the pro-nuclear sentiment of governors in some prefectures and the intense pressure for restarts from Tokyo. However, the Japanese government has ordered a gradual phase-out of the country’s reactors, reversing a previous policy of increasing nuclear’s share of the generating mix to 50 percent by 2030. (Japan’s reactors were generally credited with supplying about 30 percent of the electricity mix, but the figure was debatable, given the frequency of power failures even before Fukushima.) “To build new reactors is unrealistic, and we will decommission reactors at the end of their life spans,” Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said in his first policy speech Sept. 2. Despite this relatively dismal outlook for nuclear energy, the London-based World Nuclear Association predicts a 30 percent increase in global nuclear generating capacity over the next decade; it foresees 79 more reactors online by 2020, for a total of 514, even taking Fukushima into account. And it sees a 66 percent increase by 2030, with capacity additions in China, India, South Korea and Russia outnumbering projected declines in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Curiously, it assumes Japan will restart all but the  six  units at Fukushima Daiichi and continue to build new reactors to replace aging ones, for a net number of operating reactors in 2030 more or less the same as before Fukushima.
business/energy-environment,While the nuclear association is obviously bullish, it is less so than it was in its last forecast two years ago. And the projected increase would only keep nuclear energy treading water. As a percentage of global generation it would account for just 14 percent, the same amount the association says it currently contributes. (Other experts say the figure is lower.) In the United States, currently home to the world’s largest reactor fleet, only one proposed project,  in Texas,  was effectively canceled after Fukushima, but it had been teetering for more than a year since its largest backer, NRG Energy, decided to pull the plug. Plans for about 30 new reactors in the United States already had been whittled down to just four, despite the promise of large subsidies and President Barack Obama’s support of nuclear power, which he reaffirmed after Fukushima. Perhaps most interesting to watch will be France, whose dependence on nuclear energy is the highest in the world, with nearly 80 percent of the country’s electricity produced by 58 reactors, a fleet second in size only to that of the United States. A poll by the Institut Français d’Opinion Publique in May, published in Le Journal du Dimanche, found 77 percent of the public favored some kind of nuclear phase-out. That is not completely surprising, given past polls showing French opinion toward nuclear energy to be lukewarm. What is clear is that Fukushima is prompting a major rethinking of the country’s energy policies and that the nuclear issue promises to be a big factor in the presidential election next year.
business/energy-environment,Against this background, it is not surprising that in the World Nuclear Association’s  midcase scenario, both the United States and France show a gradual decline in the number of operating reactors over the next two decades. It has been evident for some time that nuclear energy’s future increasingly lies in Asia. Whatever the reasons for the muted response to Fukushima, the European phase-outs prompted by the tragedy would make this trend even more pronounced. But even in Asia, a nuclear future is no certain thing. Twenty-five years apart, Chernobyl and Fukushima were events that nuclear plant designers assumed would never happen. Any further major accidents could spell the industry’s doom.

nyregion,Queensboro Bridge and Brooklyn-Battery to Be Renamed - The New York Times Get ready to take the Koch Bridge to the Carey Tunnel. The Bloomberg administration is set to announce plans on Wednesday to rename the Queensboro Bridge, the Midtown muse of Simon and Garfunkel and a steel signature of the city’s skyline, after former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who turns 86 this month. The 101-year-old bridge, which cantilevers over the East River from 59th Street in Manhattan to Long Island City, Queens, is not the only structure to be rechristened this week. State legislators voted on Tuesday to rename the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel after former Gov. Hugh L. Carey. The two renamings would be the most significant change to New York City nomenclature since the Triborough Bridge took the mantle of Robert F. Kennedy two years ago. Mr. Koch, reached shortly after he got the news in a telephone call from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said he considered his new 7,500-foot-long namesake to be a perfect fit. “It’s a workhorse bridge,” Mr. Koch said. “And that’s what I am, I’m a workhorse. Always have been. I feel very compatible with it.” The former mayor, fresh from a visit to Bellevue Hospital after some trouble with his teeth, pronounced himself shocked and thrilled by the news. And he said he had no concerns that Mr. Carey’s simultaneous triumph might upstage his own. “I have been trying for years to get something named for Hugh Carey,” Mr. Koch said. “I think he’s the greatest governor of the modern era.”
nyregion,Mr. Koch said he had urged the Paterson administration to find an appropriate monument for Mr. Carey, who will turn 92 in April. The creation of the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge must be approved by the City Council; Speaker Christine C. Quinn said Tuesday that she supported it, adding that Mr. Koch “deserves way more than a street.” The renaming of the tunnel awaits only the expected signature of Gov. David A. Paterson. The 60-year-old tunnel originates in Brooklyn, Mr. Carey’s birthplace. And the Queensboro Bridge crosses into the former Congressional district of Mr. Koch. The city plans to raise private money to pay for updated road signs with the bridge’s new name. The renaming of the Triborough cost the city and state about $4 million for new signs. The bridge underwent tens of millions of dollars worth of renovations during Mr. Koch’s tenure as mayor. Mr. Bloomberg compared the Queensboro to the indefatigable Mr. Koch, who remains active in politics and is a part-time movie critic. Like Mr. Koch, the mayor said in a statement, the bridge is an “icon of the city that’s been bringing people together for a long time.” Mr. Koch put it another way: “It’s not soaring, beautiful, handsome, like the George Washington or the Verrazano,” he said. “It’s rugged, it’s hard working — and that’s me.”

theater,How Mark Rylance Became Olivia Onstage - The New York Times LONDON — When you live with a woman for more than a decade — as Mark Rylance did, on and off, with a certain countess famed for her beauty and her severity — you come to know her well. “I liked her enormously,” Mr. Rylance said recently, in a rush of respectful warmth. “I guess I liked the struggle between the form she felt she had to maintain and the great force within her.” He also came to realize that she was both funnier and sadder than he had at first suspected. Her name is Olivia, and Mr. Rylance won a Tony (his third) for portraying her on Broadway in Shakespeare’s Globe Theater’s magnificent, all-male take on “Twelfth Night” in 2013. As incarnated in that production, the reserved but emotionally ripe Olivia seemed to be woven out of starlight — when she walked it was as if she never touched the ground — and yet she was profoundly, fallibly human, too. I have met her three times, once at the Globe in London in 2002, and then twice when she came to the Belasco Theater on Broadway, and on each occasion she left me in a state of contented tears. She is, hands down, my favorite of all the Shakespeare performances I’ve had the chance to review.
theater,So when Mr. Rylance agreed to spend some time with me to discuss the birth and evolution of his Olivia, it felt “most wonderful,” to use one of the lady’s more memorable exclamations. We met on an early August afternoon in the upstairs bar of the Duke of York’s Theater here, just below the offices of Mr. Rylance’s friend and sometime producer, Sonia Friedman. Mr. Rylance, a recent Oscar winner for Steven Spielberg’s “Bridge of Spies,” arrived hatless (he had been wearing his signature fedora for most of his current television interviews promoting “The BFG,” the latest film he made with Mr. Spielberg) and bearing treasures. The uninitiated might have taken these to be the detritus of a recently cleaned-out desk drawer. But within the shabby folders and envelopes Mr. Rylance carried was a blueprint for an indelible performance: postcards of paintings of Elizabethan women; loose pages of notes from the production’s director, Tim Carroll, and its pronunciation coach, Giles Block; a long quotation from Francis Bacon about “the innocent and sweet play of children, which hide themselves to the end they may be found”; and a work book itemizing facts and fancies that might be extrapolated from Shakespeare’s words about the Countess Olivia. What wasn’t on paper were the shadows that would be unexpectedly cast upon the character by subsequent events in Mr. Rylance’s life. “I like to do all this work before, which to my mind is like turning the soil in a garden,” he said, so that when he begins rehearsals, “the soil is all very turned, it’s all bouncing around in my psyche.”
theater,Mr. Rylance first publicly presented his Olivia (with a young Etonian named Eddie Redmayne as his cross-dressing suitor, Viola) at the Middle Temple Hall, one of the old Inns of Court in the legal quarter of London, on Feb. 2, 2002, the 400th anniversary of the first recorded performance of “Twelfth Night,” which took place on that very spot. The same production opened at Shakespeare’s Globe, the open-air simulacrum of an Elizabethan theater across the Thames, for which Mr. Rylance served as the first artistic director (and frequent leading man) from 1995 to 2005. It was the fool, Feste, in “Twelfth Night” that Mr. Rylance had originally wanted to play. By that time in his tenure at the Globe, he said, he had had his surfeit of kings and princes. But after discussions with Mr. Carroll, it was decided that Olivia, the dignified aristocrat in mourning who falls in love with the cross-dressed Viola, would be a more appropriate choice. Much of the play, after all, took place on Olivia’s estate, and the Globe, for the time being, was perceived as Mr. Rylance’s house. The women who would feed his notion of this lady of the manor were varied: the Elizabethan aristocrat and intellectual Mary Sidney (on whom Olivia may have been partly based); the current Lady Salisbury, the chatelaine of Salisbury House, whom Mr. Rylance visited with a tape recorder for a tour of the estate; and the actress Judi Dench, whose recording of an Alan Bennett monologue Mr. Rylance would listen to each night before going on stage, to help him find the timbre for Olivia’s voice.
theater,Then there was the great Kabuki actor Tamasaburo. Not long before Mr. Rylance began rehearsing “Twelfth Night,” he was in Tokyo with his stepdaughter Nataasha van Kampen and saw Tamasaburo in the role of a heroic, self-sacrificing nurse in a centuries-old Japanese drama. “The first time we watched it from about 30 rows back in the cheaper seats, and immediately we bought tickets for the third row to see if it was all just smoke and mirrors. I’d say it was what I would have expected seeing Brando in ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’; it was completely fulfilled and embodied.” The minimalism of that performance greatly influenced the powerful reserve he brought to his Olivia: “If you’re very still for a long period of time, a little raise of the eyebrow will reach a long way. Because people have projected onto you so many things, that there’s a lot of life going on already.” Clothes also helped make the woman Mr. Rylance would become. The costume designer Jenny Tiramani did meticulous research to create the silk velvet gown that an Elizabethan aristocrat in mourning would have worn. Then there was the corset: “It was incredibly tight, so I wouldn’t be able to run very far; I would be breathless.”
theater,And from the corset and the full, hooped skirts of the dress, and Mr. Rylance’s memories of Tamasaburo in performance, there evolved that walk, by which he seemed to float across the stage. “It was very imperious, wasn’t it?” he said. “It was something like a slow train moving.” (Mr. Rylance here demonstrated that walk, instantly and effortlessly. Later, when I asked him about the physicality of another memorable Rylance character, the strutting, macho hero Rooster of Jez Butterworth’s “Jerusalem,” he simply puffed out his chest and — voilà — became utterly and ineffably him, too.) But it took Mr. Rylance’s appearing before and connecting with a live audience, and the “collective consciousness” it brought to bear, for his Olivia to come fully into being. “I learnt so much wit, really, from the Globe audiences,” he said. “If you can make a circle, even in a proscenium theater, if you can get a circular energy going, so that all these people are involved with it and present, then there is something curious that happens with the imagination. And I swear, as a performer, you get ideas from the collective, from the audience, much as I expect a jazz musician, like Charlie Parker, did.” There were lines — including the aforementioned “most wonderful,” which Olivia exclaims when she sees what she thinks are two identical versions of her beloved — that Mr. Rylance said he hadn’t realized were funny until he heard an audience’s laughter. But it wasn’t until he returned to Olivia, 10 years after playing her at the Globe, that he began to appreciate the depths of grief felt by the character, who has recently lost both her father and brother when the play begins.
theater,Mr. Rylance and Mr. Carroll had reunited to do the play on the West End in repertory with “Richard III,” with Mr. Rylance in the title role, and, later, on Broadway. During rehearsals in 2012, Mr. Rylance’s stepdaughter Nataasha, a filmmaker, unexpectedly died of a brain hemorrhage at 28, on a flight from New York to London. Mr. Rylance withdrew from an appearance at the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics in London, but felt obligated to continue with the Shakespeare productions. “So when I came back to rehearsals for ‘Twelfth Night,’ it was obviously very pregnant in the room that here I was playing a woman in mourning, all in black,” he said. “These characters, when you play them again, it’s really like meeting an old friend. And there Olivia was kind of saying to me, ‘Now you know what I feel.’” When the show transferred to New York, he said, “I would sit backstage very depressed, and some nights I would go out and the audience would hardly laugh. I’d get very worried about it, about making her too dark.” But on the very last performance at the Belasco — perhaps on the very last occasion that Mr. Rylance would be Olivia — something extraordinary happened. Much of Nataasha’s family sat in the second row at that performance, he said: her mother (and Mr. Rylance’s wife), Clare van Kampen; her father, Chris van Kampen; and her sister, Juliet Rylance.
theater,He surprised himself by “the lightness” that infused his performance that night. “I found that I was doing things that were very jolly and light, and I had a strange feeling of ‘What’s going on?’ Suddenly, I’d be looking at the other actors and going, ‘Isn’t that funny?’ And I realized after a little while that it was Tash,” he said, referring to his stepdaughter. “It was the experience of her voice inside me. “It’s strange how the mind works while you’re acting, because you have all sorts of quick thoughts going on, as well as the motivations with the character. But then there was this deeper voice going: ‘Whoopee! This is fun. I see why you like this.’ And for the last night of ‘Twelfth Night,’ I had the most wonderful night of all.”
sports/hockey,Many Draft Prospects Have N.H.L. in Their DNA - The New York Times BUFFALO — Matthew Tkachuk stepped off the ice at HarborCenter, where he and other top N.H.L. prospects were conducting a skills clinic for squirt-age players, and recalled his own youth hockey days. While growing up in St. Louis, hockey was a family business for Tkachuk. His father, Keith, played left wing for the Blues during the second half of an 18-year N.H.L. career, and some of his youngest teammates boarded at the Tkachuk house. Matthew Tkachuk remembered sessions of mini sticks and video games with Lee Stempniak, David Backes and Philip McRae. He also recalled skating at practice with Erik Johnson, a defenseman drafted No. 1 over all by St. Louis in 2006. “I thought that was the coolest thing ever,” he said. On the eve of Friday’s draft at First Niagara Center, Tkachuk, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound power forward, said that the most lasting impression of those days was observing the comportment of successful pros. “It was all about their habits and all about how they worked,” he said, “and all about how they took care of themselves in the weight room, with stretching, recovery, rehab. You know how talented they are on the ice, but seeing what they do away from it, that’s what is really the difference between guys that make it and guys that are very close and very skilled that don’t make it.”
sports/hockey,Tkachuk now has the chance to make it after being selected by the Calgary Flames with the No. 6 pick. He was the first among several sons of former N.H.L. players who were drafted in the first round. The others included Alexander Nylander (No. 8, Buffalo Sabres); Logan Brown (No. 11, Ottawa Senators); Jakob Chychrun (No. 16, Arizona Coyotes); Kieffer Bellows (No. 19, Islanders); Max Jones (No. 24, Anaheim Ducks); and Tage Thompson (No. 26, Blues). With the No. 1 overall pick, the Toronto Maple Leafs selected Auston Matthews, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound center from Scottsdale, Ariz., who played for the Zurich Lions of the Swiss League last season. Matthews is the first American-born player to be selected first over all since the Chicago Blackhawks drafted Patrick Kane in 2007. “The last three-plus years, there’s been a lot of long-term N.H.L. players’ sons coming up in the draft scene,” said Dan Marr, the director of N.H.L. Central Scouting. “Some of them are standouts, some are solid prospects. I think the advantage of these kids is that they grew up around the game, so they’ve seen the discipline you have to have as far as eating, sleeping, training.’’ Cliff Ronning was a 5-foot-8 shifty center who played 17 seasons in the N.H.L., setting an example for his son Ty, a 5-9 forward for the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League last season. Ty vividly remembered being awakened in the middle of the night by banging below his bedroom.
sports/hockey,“I would come downstairs and my dad was there in the gym, full sweat, flexing in the mirror,” he said. “He was working his butt off early, and he had a game the next day.” Ronning noted the discipline his father had imposed on his own life and tried to emulate it. “My dad didn’t drink till he was 37 years old,” he said. Jeff Chychrun’s eight-year N.H.L. career as a punishing defenseman was over by the time his son, Jakob, was born in 1998 in Boca Raton, Fla. Still, the elder Chychrun coached Jakob’s youth hockey teams for the Florida Junior Panthers and gave him a glimpse into the N.H.L. life. The Chychruns had season tickets for the Panthers, and through his connections, Jeff introduced Jakob to some of his hockey idols after games. “I was the biggest Sidney Crosby fan growing up, and I met him a few times at a young age,” said Jakob, a 6-2, 220-pound defenseman for the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League. “That was really cool for me, looking up to guys like that and being able to meet them, and ultimately to be where they are one day. It made me work that much harder.” Some N.H.L. fathers maintained a more active role in their sons’ hockey development. Alexander Nylander is the son of Michael Nylander, who played 15 seasons. Alexander’s brother William was a first-round pick of the Maple Leafs in 2014. Last season, Alexander Nylander was a high-scoring wing for the Mississauga Steelheads of the O.H.L. His father was an assistant.
sports/hockey,“Because he was my assistant coach, he was always on the bench, always seeing me, my habits and stuff like that,” Nylander said. “It was good, since he was hard on everybody to give 100 percent in practice, which we all did. And to prepare for the playoffs, since he’s been through it before.” Brian Bellows scored 1,022 points during a 17-year career and won a Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993. His son Kieffer is a sharpshooting left wing who has committed to play for Boston University next season. Kieffer Bellows was sensitive to suggestions that his family name had advanced his hockey career. “It’s always been my skill set and hard work that’s opened the doors to the N.H.L. draft for me,” he said. If anything, Bellows said, there can be pressure associated with living up to a famous father’s hockey legacy. “You see Matthew Tkachuk, he’s got a lot of pressure with his dad being such a great player,” he said. Keith Tkachuk, who scored 538 career goals, the third most by an American, comes from a hockey family tree. He is a cousin of the Hayes brothers, Kevin, a forward for the Rangers, and Jimmy, a right wing for the Boston Bruins. Another cousin is Tom Fitzgerald, a right wing who played in more than 1,000 N.H.L. games and is now an assistant general manager for the Devils. Fitzgerald’s son Ryan was a fourth-round pick of the Bruins in 2013. Another son, Casey, a defenseman for Boston College, is eligible for the draft.
theater,Review: ‘Fondly, Collette Richland’ Offers Open-Eyed Dreaming - The New York Times Let’s go dreaming, shall we? C’mon, it’ll be fun. Nothing will make any sense at all, and everything will make perfect sense. You’ll feel that you’re in a wild, bright land that you didn’t know existed, but one that you’re still somehow sure that you’ve visited before. What’s more, this is a dream — one of the most entertaining you’re ever likely to have — that you get to experience while you’re wide-awake. Time was when such an invitation involved a sugar cube, a chemical and a medicine dropper. But Elevator Repair Service has come up with a head trip that is as organic as it is delirious. It’s called “Fondly, Collette Richland.” And though what opened on Monday night at New York Theater Workshop is advertised as a play, it is far closer to what happens in the privacy of your own mind when you’re in bed with your unconscious. Turning seemingly passive, interior activities into externalized, dynamic theater is what Elevator Repair Service does. This is the troupe that transformed the experience of reading a great book into a glorious marathon play with “Gatz,” a word-for-word rendering of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” Sibyl Kempson’s “Fondly, Collette Richland,” directed by John Collins, is unusual for Elevator Repair Service in that it is an original play (and I use “original” advisedly). But despite its being written specifically for the theater, a perusal of its script suggests that this long and ambling work would pose seemingly insurmountable challenges to a stage director.
theater,For it occurs in a world in which everything seems to keep shifting — setting, language, human identity. And its reasons for doing so, it would appear, are far from frivolous. Ms. Kempson’s text comes with quotations from the likes of Rilke and the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, and includes aperçus like “An image costs as much labor to humanity as a new characteristic to a plant.” When one bewildered character says early that he doesn’t have a single clue as to what’s going on, someone in the audience yells, “You and me both, buddy.” Never mind that this rude interrupter turns out to be a member of the troupe. He’s surely speaking for many of us. On second thought, no, he’s not. Because by this time, “Fondly” has gathered such a head of narrative steam that you’re happy to ride it wherever it takes you. Elevator Repair Service is using every trick, flamboyant and invisible, at its disposal to keep you not only diverted but also ensnared by a labyrinthine plot that is part 1950s soap opera, part vintage Gothic, part ontological detective story and part classic theater of the absurd, à la Ionesco, Pirandello and Albee. Our immersion in this alternative universe reflects that of the stolidly married couple at its center, Mabrel (Laurena Allan) and Fritz Fitzhubert (Vin Knight), whose life, as we first see it, is as regimented as a barracks soldier’s. But one night, when they are having their meal at exactly the same time as always, a knock is heard at the door.
theater,“Please keep in mind that we prefer to have no dramatic action this evening,” calls out Mabrel, who speaks with the kinked formality of an Ivy Compton-Burnett character. Fortunately for us, that wish is not to be granted. From the moment of that ominous knock, strange and unseemly events start happening. And you can’t blame the man who knocked, a placid fellow who introduces himself as “Local Representative Wheatsun” (Greig Sargeant), or their other, newly materialized visitor, Winnifr’d Bexell (Kate Benson), Mabrel’s sister. Cause and effect are never simple here, though what subsequently follows — which includes a trip to an Alpine luxury hotel ruled over by ghostly aristocrats and a strapping Rhine maiden and a mountain man — obviously has something to do with people’s connecting to what lies buried within them. Squint hard, and you could read Mabrel’s story as a sort of allegory of awakening, as conceived by a Wagnerian feminist. Then again, don’t squint. Just lie back and revel in a world where deposed royalty steps out of the wallpaper; a six-legged pighound (a hybrid, and you should see its pups) produces milk that turns shy virgins into yelping Bacchantes; a cat in high heels mails itself to its masters’ new residence; Jesus Christ shows up on karaoke night to tell jokes; and women go wandering through perilous Alpine glaciers to return transformed — really transformed.
theater,The technical team — which includes David Zinn (sets), Jacob A. Climer (costumes), Mark Barton (lighting) and Ben Williams (sound) — has created a witty, fastidiously wrought and thoroughly disorienting visual and aural universe in which the solid and the known keep melting at the edges. (Imagine a mise-en-scène invented by a drunken Wes Anderson.) Anchors of sorts are provided by two semi-narrators, both priceless: Mike Iveson as a piano-playing priest (and later, hotel bellboy) and April Matthis as the title character, a radio host. It is she who provides the show’s introduction, evoking a time when families sat around radios to hear the same stories and have the same reactions. “And everything was easy to understand,” she says, in an eruption of angry nostalgia. “Everything was just damned easy. And fun.” Against all reasonable expectations, you’ll find that watching “Fondly, Collette Richland” provides a similarly cozy communal glow. How often, after all, do you get to dream the same dream that everybody else is having?
technology/personaltech,Protecting Your Accounts by Text or App - The New York Times Q. Which is better to use for two-step verification: getting the codes sent by text message or using an authentication app? A. Two-step verification — also known as two-factor authentication, or 2FA for short — makes your online accounts safer by requiring a separate numeric code to be typed in after you fill in the typical password. The codes you need for that second security step can be supplied by SMS text message to your phone or from a special authenticator app connected to that account. Preprinted backup codes and voice mail messages are other ways to confirm your identity in a two-factor situation. There are pros and cons to getting codes by text message or an authentication app. Using the text-message method means a quicker setup, and you don’t have to download and configure a separate app just to log into an account. You typically get text alerts immediately when someone is trying to hack into your account. But going with an authenticator app means you do not need a network connection to get a fresh code — which can be helpful when traveling outside your carrier’s network. Some security experts consider the app approach safer because you do not have to worry about the phone’s SIM card becoming compromised or messages getting intercepted, as the app generates the security codes locally on the phone. Authy, Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator are three popular programs in this category.
technology/personaltech,While it is much better than using a single password, two-factor authentication is not completely uncrackable. Skilled criminals have hijacked authentication text messages sent to mobile phone numbers, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology recently stopped recommending that users get their codes by text message because of underlying security issues. Authenticator apps are not infallible, either. Having both your accounts and your codes on the same device can provide a one-stop shopping experience for thieves, but the apps are still widely considered harder to crack than code sent by text.
obituaries,Peter Hujar Dies at 53; Made Photo Portraits - The New York Times Peter Hujar, a photographer known for his portraits of personalities in the cultural world, died of AIDS-related pneumonia at Cabrini Medical Center on Thursday. He was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan. Starting as a fashion photographer, Mr. Hujar later turned to fine-art photography and portraits. Among his subjects were Susan Sontag, Robert Wilson, Charles Ludlam and William Burroughs. In 1976, he published a book, ''Portraits in Life and Death,'' with an introduction by Ms. Sontag, in which his portraits of living personalities were accompanied by a group he had taken in the catacombs at Palermo, Sicily. In his last exhibition, at the Gracie Mansion Gallery in 1986, he showed - besides portraits - animal pictures, interiors, machinery and landscapes. His work is in the collection of several institutions, among them the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Mr. Hujar, born in New York City in 1934, graduated from the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan and later studied with the photographer Lisette Model, who was an important influence in his turning from fashion to fine-art photography. Mr. Hujar is survived by his mother, Rose Murphy of Brooklyn. A requiem mass will be held at 9:30 A.M. today at St. Joseph's Church, 371 Avenue of the Americas, at Waverly Place.
world/europe,Fringe Group in Britain Forces Others to Listen - The New York Times LONDON —  Nigel Farage boasts that his United Kingdom Independence Party is now “the fox” in the Westminster henhouse. But in reality, without a single seat in Parliament, he is still prowling the boundaries of the farm. Mr. Farage and his party did well in elections last week for local councils and the European Parliament, setting off some panic among the three more established parties. While the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, appeared to be in serious trouble, Prime Minister David Cameron fared better than expected in his real battle, against the opposition Labour Party. Last week’s voting altered the political discourse. But the landscape itself looks much the same for the election that matters most, the May 2015 general election: a hung Parliament, in which no one party has a working majority, and a race that for most voters will come down to a choice between Mr. Cameron’s Conservatives and Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. But there is no doubt that the United Kingdom Independence Party, or UKIP, has emerged as a force. Politicians are already trying to recalibrate their positions to deal with the threat of Mr. Farage, whose showing has an impact on both Britain’s domestic politics and its uncomfortable relationship with its European Union partners. At home, UKIP’s real power remains its ability to push the other parties and especially the Conservatives farther to the right, to embrace more moves against immigration and benefits for new immigrants and to ratchet up the criticism of membership in the European Union.
world/europe,In Europe, paradoxically, the strong showing of UKIP and other anti-European Union parties in countries like Denmark, France and the Netherlands is likely to help Mr. Cameron convince his colleagues that the European Union needs to pull in its horns, slow down on integration and return some powers back to the nation states. Arriving at a summit meeting of European leaders on Tuesday, Mr. Cameron called for “an approach that recognizes that Brussels has got too big, too bossy, too interfering.” Dominic Raab, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in The Guardian that “the shock delivered by anti-immigration parties in the elections should enable a sensible conversation with E.U. partners about checks to control spikes in immigration, curb benefits tourism and facilitate the removal of those who break the law.” Britain, he said, “is well placed to make the case without pandering to extremists.” Mr. Cameron has promised his party — and the nation — that if he is re-elected prime minister, he will try to negotiate a better deal for Britain in the European Union and have an in-or-out referendum on membership in 2017. Labour has refused to make such a promise, which will allow Mr. Cameron to say to those tempted to vote for UKIP that only a vote for the Conservatives will guarantee them the referendum they want, and that a vote for UKIP could throw the election to Mr. Miliband and Labour.
world/europe,One key to 2015 is a group of voters identified by the pollster Peter Kellner as “Cukips,” those who voted Conservative in 2010 but switched to UKIP for the European Parliament elections. “There are more than two million of them — 15 percent of all those who turned out to vote on Thursday and half of all UKIP voters,” wrote Mr. Kellner, the president of YouGov, a polling firm. “More than any other single group, they will decide whether David Cameron wins or loses.” If many of them vote for UKIP in marginal constituencies where Tories hold a narrow lead, they will give Labour the election. Mr. Cameron has to frame his campaign carefully, Mr. Kellner said. “If he moves to the right on Europe and immigration, he risks losing more moderate voters,” he said. “More than fretting about the precise way to talk about Europe and immigration, Cameron needs to be the sunshine leader and dispel the pessimism that has driven so many Tories into the arms of Nigel Farage.” In the short term, Mr. Cameron will seek to persuade his European colleagues to nominate a candidate broadly sympathetic to Britain’s objectives as head of the European Union’s executive, the European Commission: in other words, someone who is not associated with “more Europe,” like Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, who expects to get the job.
world/europe,Upon his arrival in Brussels on Tuesday, Mr. Cameron took what was interpreted as a thinly veiled swipe at Mr. Juncker, calling for “people running these organizations who really understand that and can build a Europe that is about openness, competitiveness and flexibility.” The British government argues that the bloc now needs to reflect on its priorities, such as creating jobs and bolstering competitiveness, and then pick a candidate that fits that profile. One of the best ways of gauging the impact of the vote is to listen to the grumbling about the party leaders. The Liberal Democrat leader, Mr. Clegg, who is also deputy prime minister in the ruling coalition, is in the deepest trouble. His party lost 10 of 11 seats in the European Parliament, and despite a reputation for good local politics, he lost 310 of 737 council seats. There is also considerable growling in Labour ranks about Mr. Miliband, who so far is not seen by voters as prime ministerial. Mr. Miliband’s main theme, the pain of austerity and the high cost of living, has been partly undercut by the turnaround in the British economy, which is creating jobs and booming compared with the rest of Europe, even if most Britons have yet to feel the impact. Despite a strong performance in London, Labour lagged behind UKIP in the European Parliament vote and only beat the Tories into third place by 1.5 percentage points. Labour is still ahead, but not by much.
world/europe,Some Labourites, like the lawmaker Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, are urging Mr. Miliband to “engage more vigorously on Europe and immigration” to respond to UKIP. Even former Prime Minister Tony Blair, much disliked in the Labour Party despite winning three elections, had advice for Mr. Miliband, urging him instead to confront UKIP and “stand for what is correct and right for Britain.” Mr. Farage announced that he would unveil UKIP’s new policy platform in Mr. Miliband’s constituency, Doncaster North, where UKIP led the voting in the European elections. The Conservatives have reluctantly rallied around Mr. Cameron, who managed expectations well and presides over a recovering economy. But the Conservatives still trail Labour, though not by a lot, and with a year before the election and Scotland voting on independence in September, more swings of opinion are likely. All three major parties are pointing hopefully to history. In the 2010 general election, UKIP won 3 percent of the vote after having received more than 16 percent of the vote in the European elections the year before. One analysis by the London School of Economics and Political Science, conducted before last week’s vote, predicted that UKIP could win as much as 14 percent of the vote next year, and still capture no seats.
us/politics,Hillary Clinton Email Inquiry Weighs if Aides Erred at ‘Send’ - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  The email described a deteriorating situation in Libya, with snipers shooting people in the streets as rebels tried to unseat President Muammar el-Qaddafi and worried American diplomats in the midst of a “phased checkout” from Benghazi. It arrived in the private email account of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, one Sunday morning in April 2011, with unforeseen consequences. That email, which included an update from the Africa Command of the Department of Defense detailing Libyan military movements, is part of the evidence that law enforcement officials say the F.B.I. is now examining as it tries to determine whether aides to Mrs. Clinton mishandled delicate national security information when they communicated with their boss. The Libyan dispatch, written by an aide to Mrs. Clinton and then forwarded to her by Huma Abedin, one of her top advisers, should have been considered classified, according to intelligence officials. And, they say, other emails to Mrs. Clinton they have found, including one addressing North Korea’s nuclear weapons system and a third discussing United States drone strikes in Pakistan, should have been marked “Top Secret.”
us/politics,There is no evidence that any of the emails — a small portion of some 60,000 that Mrs. Clinton sent or received as secretary of state — were hacked or caused any harm to American interests, and law enforcement officials have said she is not a target of their investigation. But one of the questions they are seeking to answer is whether her aides or other State Department officials broke federal rules or laws when they sent her information. And arriving at an answer will not be simple, given the complex and often conflicting views of just how diplomatically fragile the information conveyed in the emails actually was. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign, disputed any suggestion that her staff mishandled her emails. “She and her team took the handling of classified information very seriously, and at home and abroad she communicated with others via secure phone, cable, and in meetings in secure settings,” he said in a statement. Of the emails now being scrutinized by the F.B.I., the most is known about the one sent to Mrs. Clinton in April 2011 about the worsening condition in Libya. Its author was Timmy T. Davis, a State Department official who was then a personal aide to Mrs. Clinton. He was reporting to her information that had been received from J. Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya, who was killed 17 months later in Benghazi.
us/politics,“Stevens Update (important),” says the subject line, before continuing, that “Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy’s delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat, etc).” The email, a copy of which was recently posted online by the State Department, also included an update from the United States Africa Command that indicated that Mr. Qaddafi’s forces had been sent to a city south of Benghazi, “with five vehicles at the eastern gate and 50 at the western gate,” information that in retrospect, intelligence officials said, should have been considered classified. Even if Mrs. Clinton’s aides simply summarized classified material provided to them by others — as opposed to forwarding her a classified document — they may have violated federal laws that govern how intelligence information is handled, experts in government classification laws said. But Mr. Merrill pointed out that the movements by Mr. Qaddafi’s forces had been reported by newspapers before the email was ever sent. And, he said, the email that Mr. Davis sent to Ms. Abedin and other top aides to Mrs. Clinton said at the top “SBU,” an abbreviation for “sensitive but unclassified.” Ms. Abedin then forwarded it to Mrs. Clinton. While Ms. Abedin would have no clear reason to presume this information was classified, Mr. Davis could be found at fault for distributing the information in an unclassified setting. Mr. Davis, who is still at the State Department, did not respond to a request for comment.
us/politics,Another email the F.B.I. is looking at, according to officials who have been briefed on its content, addresses issues related to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, and intelligence officials have said it should have been classified as “Top Secret.” The intelligence officials said that State Department officials could have obtained information in the email only from a satellite surveillance program called Talent Keyhole. But the State Department has challenged that classification, saying it could have obtained the same information from public or nonclassified sources, an assessment that some experts say could be valid. “There is a lot of information publicly available that people inside the intelligence community or the government might not be aware of,” said Joel S. Wit, a former State Department official who specialized in North Korea issues and now serves as a senior fellow at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “So there are gray areas here. I don’t know if this particular email falls in that gray area.” A third email under scrutiny included a copy of a New York Times article about the C.I.A.’s lethal drone program, which is classified. In the email, State Department officials complain about aspects of the article. Intelligence officials say that the comments about the article should also have made the correspondence “Top Secret.” As the F.B.I. moves forward with its investigation, it will be examining all of Mrs. Clinton’s emails to determine whether any others had sensitive information on them and if those materials were inappropriately passed to her.
us/politics,That task could take a significant amount of time. The bureau has copies of the roughly 30,000 emails Mrs. Clinton gave to the State Department last year that she said were government records. And it was revealed this week that the bureau had been able to recover some of the personal emails she deleted. Republicans on Capitol Hill are trying to seize on the recovery of Mrs. Clinton’s personal emails to open a new front in their inquiries into her personal email account. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Operations Committee, has called on the F.B.I. to turn over any of these recovered emails to the State Department or some other third party so they can be reviewed to determine if any should have been retained as government records. “If the FBI has recovered all of her emails, they must be reviewed promptly by the appropriate authorities to determine what is official and what is not, and whether they contain classified material, so that any national security concerns can be mitigated,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement Wednesday. The existence of the personal emails, and the possibility that they could be made public, poses potential risks for Mrs. Clinton as the presidential campaign intensifies. “This will enable people to second-guess the delineation she drew between personal and official records and also to zero in on any troubling content of the emails that she called personal,” said Daniel J. Metcalfe, who served for 26 years as the head of the Justice Department division that supervised government records and privacy issues.
us/politics,But it remains unclear if the F.B.I. will agree to turn over any emails it has recovered, at least until any investigation it is conducting is complete. Yet it also may be ordered to do so by a federal judge who is already handling a case filed by a conservative group, Judicial Watch, trying to obtain copies of the emails. Even if such a review found that Mrs. Clinton had wrongly tried to dispose of what should have been considered government records — a conclusion that could be embarrassing and have political consequences for her — Mr. Metcalfe said there is no formal penalty if the individual involved has left the government.
dining,At Eleven Madison Park, a Reinvention - The New York Times THERE’S something Whitmanesque about what Daniel Humm, the chef of Eleven Madison Park, and Will Guidara, the general manager, envision for their restaurant when it reveals its reinvention on Friday. Think of it as a gastronomic paean to New York City, full of dishes and gestures that make reference to the four-century saga of the metropolis. The flourishes they will incorporate into the restaurant’s repertory are undoubtedly attention-getting and arguably risky. Will they work? That’s hard to predict, but Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara strive to emulate Miles Davis, the jazz trumpeter who had a habit of ditching one style of playing as soon as he (or his audience) had grown too comfortable with it. Because of him, the words “endless reinvention” appear on a sign in the Eleven Madison Park kitchen. “Endless reinvention only works if you believe that what you are evolving into is even better,” Mr. Guidara said. “We think our restaurant will be better when it becomes this.” After all, “New” is the first word in the city’s name. Here are three elements at Eleven Madison Park that are supposed to remind us of that. Carrots’ Star Turn It could be argued that no restaurant can pay tribute to the food of New York without offering homage to a certain charred, bloody staple of the city’s history. This, of course, is the city that gave the world Peter Luger, Sparks, the Delmonico steak and the cheek-smeared pagan ritual known as the beefsteak dinner.
dining,But can you honor a steak without serving steak? Mr. Humm thinks he has figured out the solution. Using carrots. “We started with steak because we said we have to do something with steak in New York,” he said. “It was delicious, and it worked, but it wasn’t original enough.” The chef knew that some of the most distinctive carrots in the country come from an area of the Hudson Valley (sometimes poetically referred to as “muckland” or “the drowned lands”), where the deep black soil of what used to be an ancient lake produces vegetables of uncommon flavor and texture. There, the dirt is “like a big sponge that retains moisture,” said Alex Paffenroth, who owns Paffenroth Gardens, a 72-acre farm in Warwick, N.Y. Using bunches of carrots (with the greens still attached) freshly plucked from Mr. Paffenroth’s land, a tray full of unexpected ingredients (including smoked bluefish, mustard oil and the yolk of a pickled quail egg) and a classic meat grinder latched onto the side of each table, Mr. Humm and his crew plan to give diners a very orange spin on steak tartare. “We’re kind of switching what’s in the center of the dish,” he said. “I think things are evolving away from meats.” Mystery Dessert The most talked about element of the Eleven Madison Park revamp is one that very few people have seen. While it would be ungracious to ruin the surprise (and downright churlish to reveal how it works), perhaps it is enough to say that one dessert course will hinge on a card trick.
dining,The trick was inspired by the fast-talking scams, like three-card monte, that used to be a fixture of the New York streetscape. A deck of cards has been designed to incorporate the names of ingredients and the four leaves that make up the restaurant’s logo. We can tell you that last spring, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara met with Jonathan Bayme and Dan White, illusionists from a company called Theory11. Both have worked with David Copperfield to develop tricks. “We try to infuse everything we do with mystery,” Mr. Bayme said. Mystery is one thing. But how can sleight-of-hand possibly predict which sweet an individual restaurant diner is about to try? As Mr. Bayme put it, “Working with David Copperfield, you have a very high bar for what is impossible.” Bushwick on the Rocks, Please It makes sense that Eleven Madison Park would tip its hat to the manhattan, the cocktail named after the island on which the restaurant sits. Which is why a special cart, fashioned from wood and steel by Regency Service Carts in Brooklyn, will roam the dining room to give customers instant tableside infusions of rye, vermouth and bitters. Inevitably, though, Mr. Humm and his comrades will not stop there. Leo Robitschek, right, the bar manager, has put together a cocktail menu full of neighborhood-specific variations on the manhattan. There’s the Greenpoint, which involves yellow Chartreuse. The Park Slope, which invites Punt e Mes and apricot brandy to the party. The Arthur Avenue, a Bronxian curveball that brings in bourbon, mezcal, Punt e Mes and Cynar.
dining,Mr. Robitschek is quick to point out that many of these drinks are more than just nods to neighborhoods. They represent shout-outs to bartenders across the city who first came up with the recipes at spots like the Pegu Club, Milk & Honey and Death & Co. So when that cart pulls up next to your table, think of it as a chance to embark on a citywide bar crawl without ever leaving your seat. “You get to see the creation of what you’re about to drink,” Mr. Robitschek said. “It’s part of the show.”
arts/music,A Reluctant Teenager, a Barbershop Quartet and a Revelation - The New York Times The memory is hazy, but I can’t imagine that I went enthusiastically into a concert hall in Portland, Maine, on May 18, 1974. The groups on the bill were not the kind that most 19-year-olds were flocking to see. Yet my mind was blown just as thoroughly as if I’d seen Kiss or Queen. It was blown by a barbershop quartet named the Gentlemen’s Agreement. I was in my first year of college at the University of Maine at Portland-Gorham, still living with my parents. I realize that a lot about that sentence says “loser,” but I was at least making an effort to be cool. My record collection had three Frank Zappa albums in it. Why my father secured tickets to a barbershop concert is unclear. My mother, now 94, thinks that perhaps my Uncle Larry, a barbershopper in his college days, was visiting. Also unclear is why I agreed to go along on an old-fogey outing. It was, I believe, a concert put on by the local chapter of the preposterously named Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America, which these days is generally called the Barbershop Harmony Society. As I remember it, the show included a number of groups, all building up to the headliners, the Gentlemen’s Agreement. When those four men started to sing, an unremarkable evening turned into a revelation. I don’t remember what they sang, but I remember being astonished by the seamlessness of it, the intricacy of the harmony, their ability to invest the songs with personality, no guitar or drum kit in sight. I had expected stodgy and instead got stunning.
arts/music,In 1971 the group had won the society’s international championship in New Orleans, and even my indifferent ears could immediately hear why. The blend of the four voices was sublime, which is part of what separates an exceptional quartet from an ordinary one; any bass, baritone, tenor and lead can tackle a song, but only a rare one finds real convergence. Beyond that, though, the Gentlemen’s Agreement had a sense of showmanship, making each song a story. You can still feel the men’s stage presence in their recordings, whether it’s the cheeky humor they inject into the old Doris Day hit “Everybody Loves a Lover” or the aching beauty they bring to the spiritual “Hush.” When I walked into that concert I was a callow fellow (yeah, the group’s repertory included a wonderful “Try to Remember”), but I came out with a new appreciation for barbershop, which later blossomed into an appreciation of a cappella in general. I also came out with two of the group’s albums, “Just for the Record” and “Gentlemen Prefer ... Barbershop,” and I later added the third, “Final Agreement.” I still have them. They sit in my boxed-up, carefully alphabetized vinyl collection, between Lita Ford and the Georgia Satellites, Frank Zappa bringing up the rear.
arts/music,The group’s lead singer, Drayton Justus, told me in a telephone interview about the busy years when the quartet toured after its 1971 victory. The group came out of the Detroit area and consisted of Mr. Justus, Al Rehkop singing tenor, Bob Whitledge as bass and Glenn Van Tassell as baritone (later replaced by Greg Backwell and then Jim Gross). It was formed in 1969, and Mr. Justus said that the four, all with experience in other quartets, knew pretty quickly that they had something special. “It seemed easy for us to lock into a chord and have it, as barbershoppers say, ‘ring,’ ” he told me. They medaled in the 1970 championships and then won it all the next year, a very fast rise in the barbershopping world. The resulting tours included one to South Vietnam to entertain American military personnel. “We could go into places that Bob Hope couldn’t go because his troupe was too big,” Mr. Justus, now in his 80s, recalled. “All we had to have was the four of us and a pitch pipe and an escort officer.” They went any place a helicopter could get to, which meant they went all the way to the edge of no man’s land. “They had 18 men at that station, and half of them were always sleeping and half of them were awake,” Mr. Justus said. “So while we were there, we put on a little program for nine men.”
arts/music,The Gentlemen’s Agreement was among groups trying to expand the possibilities of barbershop back then. The quartet played with rhythm, key changes and more, an adventurousness that helped pave the way for the anything-goes approach seen throughout a cappella music today. “The quartets before us, many of them, were not as stylized in terms of interpreting the lyrics,” Mr. Justus said. “We were very much concerned with singing it like you’d say it. We took more liberties with tempo and fluctuations of all kinds that you would not obtain just taking the notes off the paper.” And at the Portland concert, I “got” all that; I saw the artistry of it. In retrospect, I attribute that to having had a decent music education, especially in the parochial schools of Bryn Athyn, Pa., where the church congregation sang in four- and sometimes six-part harmony. To really appreciate a fine performance, it helps to understand a bit about what it takes to create the effect that’s being created. In any case, from that one night of exposure to the Gentlemen’s Agreement came, for me, a lifelong affection for a cappella music of all sorts. And though I’m not a music reviewer, I’ve repeatedly found that interest relevant to my job as a television, film and theater critic, thanks to “Pitch Perfect,” the a cappella competition show “The Sing-Off,” Jimmy Fallon’s goofy barbershop-music skits and more.
arts/music,The real value of that night, though, is that it was the first time I had what for me was the ultimate arts-consumer experience: going into a performance expecting nothing, coming out transformed. It’s an experience I’ve rarely had since, though I’ve written more than 1,500 reviews. Virtually everything today is promoted and buzzed-about nearly to death before a critic sees it. And the sheer volume of cultural output means that practically everything seems as if it is imitating or borrowing from something else. There are no blank slates. That’s what I miss: really having my eyes or ears opened in a way I wasn’t expecting, and in a way that lingers. The Gentlemen’s Agreement began “Just for the Record” with a peppy rendition of “One of Those Songs,” which is about an encounter with a catchy tune: “Later on, you recall it in some other year,” the lyrics go. “You may start to smile or you may shed a tear. You’ll find that a part of your life then belongs to one of those wonderful songs.”

nyregion/westchester,Foreclosure Crisis in Westchester Crosses Economic Boundaries - The New York Times MOUNT VERNON THE room  was filled with people in trouble or about to be, and the fact that they were in the city’s public library was bitterly fitting. The library is on South First Avenue, a street that is the epicenter of Westchester’s foreclosure crisis, with  at least 27 homes on just four blocks in various stages of foreclosure over the past several years. The occasion was a workshop run by a nonprofit group called Community Housing Innovations, aimed at educating people about their options in grappling with foreclosure. Andrea Moody, a soft-spoken 45-year-old account manager and single mother of two teenagers, was there to take notes because it has been three months since she made a full $2,600 mortgage payment to Chase Manhattan. “I don’t want to lose my home,” Ms. Moody said afterward. “My dad had it, and it was a source of pride to him, and it hurts me to think I could lose it.” She or her parents have owned the three-family house in Mount Vernon for 40 years and regularly kept up with the mortgage payments.  But, like many modest-income owners of two- and three-family homes, Ms. Moody began having problems with a longtime tenant — damaged walls and floors, fights to which the police had to be summoned — and her plight was aggravated by bad luck and a bad economy.
nyregion/westchester,She finally got the tenants to leave a year and half ago. But the cost of repairing the damage while paying the mortgage, coupled with the mess left by a contractor who went bankrupt, leaving an unfinished apartment that is hard to rent, has proved too much for Ms. Moody. So she kept her ears peeled for ways Community Housing might help her modify the terms of her loan. Like Ms. Moody, thousands of homeowners across Westchester County, a synonym for suburban America, are trapped in mortgages whose monthly payments they cannot make. A detailed examination by The New York Times of more than 182,000 homes in foreclosure  around the region found that  more than 4,400 Westchester County homes —   2.3 percent of all residential properties — were in some stage of foreclosure between January 2006 and August 2008. What worries housing advocates is that more home owners are struggling. In March, 3 percent of Westchester County residential mortgages were at least 90 days past due, almost double the rate from the same time last year, according to preliminary data from First American CoreLogic, a real estate data firm. As the library meeting made clear, most foreclosures were concentrated in some of the poorest ZIP codes — in pockets of Mount Vernon, Yonkers, Port Chester, Peekskill and White Plains. But foreclosures were not confined to those places. Scarsdale had 95 properties in default; Pelham, 32; Rye, 30; Larchmont, 27;  and Chappaqua, 22. A notice of default  comes after nonpayment for 90 days and is the first step in the foreclosure process.
nyregion/westchester,Compared to other counties in the region, including Suffolk and Nassau,  Westchester’s delinquency rate is among the lowest and pales in comparison with the hardest-hit areas, like Osceola, Lee and St. Lucie Counties in Florida, where more than one in five mortgages is past due. Still, the foreclosure wallop has affected even vintage Westchester neighborhoods like the Rochelle Heights and Rochelle Park enclaves in New Rochelle, where the Tudors and colonials were built a century ago when the country’s first bedroom communities were laid out and where homes not so long ago fetched a million dollars and more. Seven houses on Hamilton Avenue in those two neighborhoods are in various stages of being taken over or managed by banks, as are more than a dozen other of the enclaves’ 350 homes, according to the analysis by The Times. Westchester’s painful toll tells much about how widespread this decade’s home-buying frenzy was. In too many cases, families took out mortgages or refinanced on payment terms that gave them only the thinnest margin for error and left no cushion for a plunging housing market. Nevertheless, The Times analysis shows that foreclosure has touched Westchester more lightly than other parts of the region. The  foreclosure  rate of 2.3 percent of all properties for the 32-month period analyzed is lower than the overall regional rate of 2.9 percent during that same period.  Not surprisingly,  higher-income communities experienced the lowest rates of foreclosures, and about one-third of Westchester ZIP codes, with median incomes of $100,000 or more in the 2000 census, fell into that category.
nyregion/westchester,Just as elsewhere in the region, the highest rates of foreclosure in the county were in neighborhoods with mostly black and Hispanic residents. . In mostly black census tracts, 11 percent of homes were in foreclosure  —  more than seven times the rate for mostly white areas. In mostly Hispanic tracts, the rate was more than 8 percent, more than five times the rate in mostly white areas. Nationally, a report issued Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center said that gains made in homeownership over the past decade by African-Americans and native-born Latinos were tied disproportionately to relaxed lending standards and subprime loans and that the gains had eroded faster in the downturn than those of whites. The banks listed on Westchester default notices include icons of the industry — Deutsche Bank, Citicorp, Wells Fargo. But interviews with real-estate brokers, bankers and government officials indicate that the loans were often dangled by little-known mortgage brokers who received a commission for originating a loan on behalf of a bank whether the payment terms were realistic or not. “There were many of these mortgage brokers operating in neighborhoods, often in neighborhoods of color, taking advantage of people who wanted to get their piece of the American dream,” said State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat who twice investigated subprime mortgages. “Everyone would be O.K. since the property would be worth more than they paid for it.”
nyregion/westchester,Partly under pressure from the federal government to increase lending in low- and moderate-income areas, particularly in “redlined” black and Hispanic neighborhoods where banks had historically refused to lend, these banks themselves created new species of mortgages for people who might not easily pass an income verification or afford a 20 percent down payment. Mortgage brokers bore no risk if a homeowner defaulted. Big banks, too, seemed to shrug off the risk because they often resold the mortgages to other banks or packaged them into securities backed by pools of mortgages that included hundreds of more reliable borrowers. Together, these mortgage-backed securities were sold to even more detached investors because an ocean of American and foreign money was looking for high-yield investments. When home prices started slipping as the economy stumbled in late 2007, some homeowners found that they owed more on a house than it was worth, so they could not refinance to rid themselves of exorbitant interest rates. Senator Klein’s October 2007 study of subprime lenders listed the top three banks that originated defaulted mortgages in Westchester as Fremont Investment and Loan, Dynamic Dwellings and Washington Mutual. The top three lenders who held the mortgages at the time of foreclosure were US Bank, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. Anthony Marciano, owner of a local real estate brokerage, Century 21 Marciano, told of how four or five years ago mortgage brokers began enticing residents to refinance. In phone calls and fliers, he said, they urged residents to pull out the equity in their houses in order to buy other homes as investments or to pay for home renovations or college tuition.
nyregion/westchester,“They came in like vultures and are no longer around,” Mr. Marciano said of the mortgage brokers, though he puts more blame on banks for letting brokers originate loans at seductive rates. Yet Brian Conway, an assistant district attorney in the Westchester County district attorney’s office who spoke at the Mount Vernon foreclosure workshop, acknowledged in an interview that there had not been a single criminal indictment against fraudulent brokers or bankers in recent years. Many complaints the office gets, he said, end up being handled through civil litigation, though he urged those in the audience who suspect fraud to contact him. The Obama administration has only recently put together the pieces of its two-month-old plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. The damage that foreclosure does to a neighborhood is evident on South First Avenue in Mount Vernon, where on a street lined with modest clapboards and stuccos with towel-sized front yards,  27 homes have been in various stages of foreclosure over the past several years, according to the data analyzed by The Times.  Many of the owners are gone, with the doors padlocked, the windows sealed with plywood, the shrubbery collecting wind-blown advertising fliers. Neighbors indicate that in many cases the blue-collar homeowners had depended on rent from upstairs tenants who left or were fired or, in one case, shot to death. That is how narrow the margin of financial survival can be in the neighborhood.
nyregion/westchester,At the meeting at the Mount Vernon library, many of the two dozen people who attended had other reasons they could not make their payments. Kwok Fay Hugh, 59, a carpenter and widowed father of two, said he had been overwhelmed by debt, including $28,000 in medical bills as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. That made it difficult to keep up payments on an 8 percent  subprime mortgage (there was no income verification) for his Cape-style home in Elmsford. “I’m not good with paperwork — my wife took care of paperwork,” he said of his wife, who died in 1996. “I don’t understand the mortgage stuff. I’m a simple person, a carpenter, that’s it.” But he, Ms. Moody and the others took some consolation in one another’s company. “There are people out there who can help you, and you’re not alone,” Ms. Moody said. “That was comforting.”

us,In North Carolina, Governing With a Punch and a Handshake - The New York Times RALEIGH, N.C. — Perhaps the outcome was to be expected here in deeply conflicted North Carolina. While voters chose the brash, bullying TV boss of “The Apprentice” for president, they simultaneously chose an earnest, low-key character closer to Andy Griffith as governor. But nearly three months into his term, the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, will need more than his gentle, tobacco-country politesse to govern effectively. In basketball terms, Mr. Cooper is going to have to throw some elbows. So last week, Mr. Cooper served a mix of sugar and threat as he delivered his first State of the State address before the famously aggressive Republican-controlled General Assembly. He presented the speech with a smile — but everyone was aware of the uncomfortable fact that the new governor was suing the legislature over laws it passed that significantly curtail his power. “I promise to listen, to engage, to build consensus, to compromise when possible,” Mr. Cooper said during his address. “I promise to fight only when we can’t come to agreement — or when you leave me no choice.” North Carolina has been split by extraordinary partisan strife as Republicans, historically the state’s underdog party, enjoyed four years of undivided government, pursuing an ambitious agenda that Democrats saw as an assault on the environment, public education and minority voting rights.
us,In response, the left repeatedly filled the halls of the State Capitol complex for protests, calling the movement “Moral Mondays.” Conservatives stewed at the implication that their small-government vision, which they credit with restoring the state’s fiscal health and kick-starting a moribund economy, was somehow immoral. The challenge Mr. Cooper faces as he seeks to patch up North Carolina may serve as a test of whether the nation’s increasingly belligerent political factions can find anything to agree on. The test is best exemplified by the fact that Mr. Cooper has been unable, thus far, to find a way to undo the Republican-backed law known as House Bill 2, which curbs protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It also requires transgender people in public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. The measure has prompted boycotts, national outrage, and decisions by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Atlantic Coast Conference and the National Basketball Association to move prestigious sports events out of state. Mr. Cooper criticized House Bill 2 during his campaign against Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent, who had signed the bill into law, and he continues to do so. In his speech last week, he referred to the law as “the dark cloud hanging over our state of promise,” and called for its repeal. Many Democrats rose to applaud. Few Republicans did.
us,A lawyer and lifelong Democrat, Mr. Cooper could fit a Hollywood casting director’s vision of a Southern governor from either party. He is 59 years old and trim, with a full head of graying hair and a subtle drawl that betrays his roots in rural Nash County. For years, he served as a state representative, then Senate majority leader, earning a reputation as a competent centrist and heir to the state’s moderate Democrat tradition. He then spent 16 years as state attorney general, taking a turn in the national spotlight with his independent review of the racially charged and badly botched sexual assault cases that a local prosecutor had brought against three white former members of the Duke University men’s lacrosse team. Mr. Cooper declared the men innocent in April 2007. He also declined to bring criminal charges against their African-American accuser despite what he called her “faulty” accusations, a move that, like others in Mr. Cooper’s career, could be viewed as overly cautious, politically savvy or both. During last year’s campaign, Mr. Cooper positioned himself as an even-keeled leader who would tamp down the drama in Raleigh. He won by nearly 10,000 votes, even as Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 175,000 votes statewide in the presidential contest. Republicans then spent nearly a month challenging the results. Before Mr. Cooper’s swearing-in, legislators passed the contentious laws that weakened Mr. Cooper by loosening the governor’s control over the state elections board, granting Civil Service protection to hundreds of Mr. McCrory’s political appointees and giving the Senate the ability to approve or reject the governor’s agency heads.
us,On Friday, a three-judge state panel issued a mixed opinion, siding with Mr. Cooper over the elections board and the Civil Service jobs, but ruling that the Senate does have the power to approve his cabinet appointees. Even some Republicans took Mr. Cooper’s suit challenging the laws as a sign that he would not be bullied. “Roy’s an easygoing, soft-spoken guy in person, and would generally avoid a fight if it were possible,” said Carter Wrenn, a veteran strategist who worked on the Senate campaigns of Jesse Helms. “And so I was a little surprised how aggressive he’s been in responding. I guess he had no choice.” Mr. Cooper has rejected, for now, new legislation that would repeal House Bill 2, including a contentious provision that prohibits local governments from passing nondiscrimination ordinances. But it would allow the local nondiscrimination ordinances to be subject to a referendum, which Mr. Cooper argued would be “like putting the Civil Rights Act to a popular vote in cities in the South during the 1960s.” In other ways, North Carolinians are getting a sense of what life might look like under a divided government in which Republicans enjoy veto-proof legislative majorities. Mr. Cooper’s proposed budget, unveiled this month, does not call for tax increases. John Hood, a conservative commentator, has called that “a crushing defeat” for liberals who spent years “attacking Republicans and conservatives for cutting state taxes too much.” Mr. Hood said in an interview that he was concerned that Mr. Cooper, by appointing department heads, would be able to increase regulations that Republicans have pared back.
us,In another significant change, Mr. Cooper and the new attorney general, Josh Stein, a Democrat, announced that they would withdraw the state’s request for the United States Supreme Court to review a lower court’s rejection of a Republican-backed law that limited access to the polls. An appeals court found that the law sought to “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” On Thursday, Mr. Cooper issued his first veto, of a bill that would make some judicial elections partisan. In his speech last week, Mr. Cooper eschewed such sensitive topics and instead focused on places where he thought the two sides might agree, such as raises for public-school teachers. The official response from Republicans was delivered by the Senate president pro tempore, Phil Berger, and it was blistering. “They call their neighbors who vote conservatives into office stupid, uninformed, dupes and deplorables,” Mr. Berger said of liberals. “Tonight we heard the left’s new champion. Roy Cooper is pushing their vision for the future of North Carolina, except it’s not a vision for the future of North Carolina at all. It’s a mirage. It’s merely a retreat to our troubled past.” The next day, Mr. Cooper traveled to Wilmington, where he made his case to the local Chamber of Commerce. The reception was polite, but far from ecstatic — especially when he called for repealing House Bill 2, an idea that garnered only light applause. Deb Hause, a marketing coordinator, said House Bill 2 made some sense to her. “I have daughters,” Ms. Hause said, and she worried about changing traditional restroom norms.
us,She said she had met Mr. Cooper numerous times and found him to be exceedingly pleasant. “But he’s got a rough road ahead,” she added. “Let’s be honest.”

sports/football,N.F.L. Relaxes Celebration Rules to Bring Some Fun Back - The New York Times Maybe a little fun is coming back to the No Fun League. The N.F.L., which technically stands for National Football League, despite some wisecracks to the contrary, announced on Tuesday that it was loosening its strict rules about on-field celebrations. “We are relaxing our rules on celebrations to allow players more room to have fun after they make big plays,” the league said in a statement. Celebrations now permitted are “using the football as a prop” after a touchdown, “celebrating on the ground” and “group demonstrations.” But it is not open season for celebrations. “Offensive demonstrations, celebrations that are prolonged and delay the game, and those directed at an opponent will still be penalized,” the statement said. Celebration penalties were up sharply last season. The league said it had asked officials to pay extra attention to enforcing the existing rules. Antonio Brown of the Pittsburgh Steelers was penalized and fined in Week 1 for twerking after a touchdown and again in Week 4 for thrusting his pelvis. Josh Norman of the Washington Redskins drew a penalty and a fine for miming shooting an arrow. The crackdown was such a hot topic that Andrew Hawkins of the Cleveland Browns celebrated a touchdown by stiffly placing the ball on the turf and robotically walking away in a nod to the tough rules. In another rule change, overtime will be shorter, and there may be more ties as a result.
sports/football,The N.F.L. owners agreed on Tuesday at their spring meetings in Chicago to reduce regular-season overtime periods to 10 minutes from 15. The league said the change was designed primarily for player safety. Coaches believe that by the 10-minute mark of overtime, players tend to hit high levels of fatigue, making them more vulnerable to injury. Over the last five seasons, 83 games have gone into overtime, and 22 of them lasted more than 10 minutes, according to N.F.L. Media. Five of those games ended in ties. Presumably, many of the games decided after 10 minutes would have ended as ties under the new rule. The N.F.L. introduced overtime games in 1974; before that, ties were significantly more common. There was an average of six ties a season in a smaller league in the 10 years before overtime began. The owners also voted to change the preseason cut policy. In the past, teams reduced their rosters from 90 players to 75 and then to 53. Now, the middle step will be eliminated and teams will drop directly to 53 from 90 after the preseason. The move figures to create a chaotic few days as teams scramble to set their rosters and pick up players cast off by other teams. The owners also agreed to ban jumping over the line to block kicks and to permit two players each season to come off injured reserve rather than one.
sports/baseball,With a New Breed of Fans, Even the Yankees Must Adapt - The New York Times Yankee baseball is no longer quite enough to fill all the seats in the Bronx, at least not for a new generation of multitasking, jaded fans. That overdue admission has led to restructuring of both the facilities and the ticket pricing at Yankee Stadium, where attendance has been creeping downward and the starting rotation features more potholes than the Grand Concourse. So on Tuesday the Yankees unveiled the stadium’s new features, which include a picnic area, refreshment terraces, charging stations for personal devices, a lounge equipped with televisions tuned to other sports events, and a children’s playground complete with breast-feeding facilities. The idea is to offer more options and to cater more to families, officials said, in response to surveys sent out during the past few seasons. “The answers have been pretty consistent,” Kevin Dart, vice president for ticket sales, service and operations for the Yankees, said after a media tour. “They want more family-oriented areas. Different fans enjoy the game the way they want to enjoy it.” Unspoken on this media tour was the threat that the resurgent Mets are making to the Yankees’ traditional status as the No. 1 team in New York. Last season, the Mets cut in half the gap in tickets sold by both teams, with the Yankees — who have made it to the postseason only once in the past four seasons — now fewer than 300,000 ahead.
sports/baseball,And a Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that 45 percent of New York fans now favor the Mets, compared with 43 percent for the Yankees, which is well within the 3.6 percent margin of error. So it is a virtual tie, which should be further evidence that the Yankees need to do something — sooner than later — to resist the Queens incursion. Sure enough, the official Yankees website was selling a $45 Pinstripe Pass for the home opener next Monday, a package that included both a seat to the game and a drink. And with the restructuring, any fan can now find plenty of places to purchase that drink, including the new Toyota Terrace adjacent to the Bleacher Creature loyalists in right field. The obstructed-view bleacher seats in left and right fields have been removed to make way for concrete terraces that sell mixed drinks for a minimum $15 charge. This juxtaposition is not lost on the Bleacher Creatures, who still pay just $20 for each ticket and do not plan to add $15 to their tab by walking a few yards to buy a margarita. Tina Lewis, a leader of the bleacher group, said the children’s playground and picnic areas were good ideas. She had no problem with construction crews’ ripping out the 1,300 unpopular obstructed-view bleacher seats. The Toyota Terrace, however, was a bit over the top — at least, in her opinion.
sports/baseball,“What is this, a black-tie event?” said Lewis, who prefers Gatorade to gin and tonic. “I can just about guarantee the Bleacher Creatures don’t drink mixed drinks. Just as long as these fancy-schmancy people don’t come over to Section 203, it’ll be all right.” The Yankees have also introduced so-called dynamic pricing, which alters the cost of tickets based on supply and demand. In this way, purchasing a seat at Yankee Stadium is not unlike buying a ticket on United Airlines. Prices for the same seat may vary, day to day, according to how many of them are available. The actual opponent matters less than the projected vacancies. For the Yankees, this is all fresh ground. But other franchises with far fewer championship banners have been hustling like this for years. Having learned their lesson, Yankee officials vow they will continue to keep up with the new generation’s whims, preferences and limited attention spans. “We’ll always keep evaluating,” Dart said. It is a new day, a new pitch in the Bronx. If the Yankees’ starters could pitch as well on the mound, marketers might not have to hustle quite so hard.
style,CryptoKitties, Explained ... Mostly - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Joe Buttram, a former mixed martial arts fighter and start-up security guard turned cryptocurrency investor, was looking at a new toy called a CryptoKitty. “You can see he wants to sire,” Mr. Buttram, 27, said. For about 20 of the cryptocurrency called ether ($14,000 at the time), the cartoon cat would “mate” with one of Mr. Buttram’s, and he would get a new CryptoKitty. That kitty could inherit its father’s desirable eyes (traits include thicccbrowz) or fur pattern (like totesbasic). Let’s back up. Every new technology gets a game that helps bring it careening into the mainstream. Social networks had FarmVille. Mobile phones had Angry Birds. And, its investors hope, blockchain has CryptoKitties. Blockchain technology like Bitcoin and Ethereum, ledgers for recording virtual currency transactions, is booming, and CryptoKitties is the first big blockchain game. As they did with baseball cards, people collect CryptoKitties, but these cards can breed. The Ethereum network, whose currency is called ether, is valued at about $70 billion, but not many of the investors really know what their ether can be used to do. And now here’s one thing you can do with it: Ether is the only currency that exists in the CryptoKitties world. Since CryptoKitties was introduced a month ago, 180,000 people have signed up. They’ve spent about $20 million in ether, and more than 10 kitties have sold for over $100,000.
style,Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, CryptoKitties is now a team of 18. Next the company is starting social games like kitty beauty contests and expanding into other “blockchain collectibles.” “We’re just like, man, people want cats,” said the CryptoKitties co-founder Mack Flavelle, who works for AxiomZen product design studio. “We thought it would build slowly, take a few months, but it’s been so fast.” A few years ago, investors talked about cryptocurrencies becoming a mainstream currency, so you would one day buy coffee with your ether. But high transaction fees, slow processing and wildly fluctuating prices make it a tricky replacement for cash. So what to do with $73 billion of digital money? “There’s nothing to do with it, so hey, for a couple bucks now you can get a cat,” Mr. Flavelle said. “Nobody’s even pretending it’s going to be a transactional currency anymore. It’s a stored value.” Industry experts echo Mr. Flavelle’s conception of cryptocurrency as, well, not yet a currency and digital kittens as a pretty good use for it. One of those is Dan Romero, 30, the general manager of Coinbase, the main trading platform for cryptocurrencies. “In 2014, it was more corporate, everyone was just talking about using cryptocurrency for payments,” Mr. Romero said. No longer: “Now we’re all talking about CryptoKitties,” he said. “There’s been a resurgence of playing, and that’s a good sign.”
style,Like Beanie Babies before them, CryptoKitties are collectibles. Each kitty has a core “DNA” on the blockchain, and the game is basically to mate them (the illustrators do not go deep into specifics) and see what kitty results. The progeny tend to have their parents’ traits (an expensive cat will have an expensive kitten) but might surprise or disappoint with more or less valuable traits than either of its parents. There’s a limited number of highly desirably first-generation kitties and four billion possible combinations of cats based on traits the on-staff artists have created (whisker aesthetic, background color, fur type). The company gets a 3.75 percent cut of the breeding and selling auctions. “And the other thing we have are fancy cats, which are hard to unlock, and if you get one of those, it’s fancy,” Mr. Flavelle said. What makes it fancy? “Fancy cat is a specific recipe,” he said. O.K. The activity helps make sense of the strange world of Ethereum, Mr. Flavelle said. "In our lizard brains we have fear of chaos,” he said. “Collecting allows you to bring order.” And the game does seem to be attracting a lot of people who are now willing to go through the byzantine process of getting a digital wallet and acquiring ether. When the company started, there were so many cat-based transactions, it slowed down the Ethereum network, upsetting regular traders. “I’m not calling all blockchain people neckbeards,” Mr. Flavelle said. “But when these cartoon cats come through and sit on your network and break it, you’re not happy.”
style,Where there’s $20 million changing hands, there will be brokers. And a new set is cropping up to help manage the market. At an Ethereum cocktail party in San Francisco one recent night, hosts projected CryptoKitties across the wall. Cassandra Shi, 27, quit her job as a product manager at the financial technology firm Enova three months ago, and is going into CryptoKitties, developing a new price evaluation tool. “I’m making a Kelley Blue Book to assess their real value,” Ms. Shi said. “There are a bunch of cattributes” — yes — “and you can do a machine learning model to assess, based on cattributes, how much each should be worth.” Ms. Shi, who lives in Oakland, sees the digital kittens as a way to get mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency beyond the mostly white and mostly male online communities that have been early adopters, she said, gesturing around the party. “A lot of people get into this from r/bitcoin,” she said, referring to the Reddit group many investors cite as their main source of news. “Which is not a very inclusive community.” “I have three friends who bought ether just for CryptoKitties,” Ms. Shi said. “And those are people who wouldn’t have except the kitties are so adorable.”
health,When Tanning Turns Into an Addiction - The New York Times Welcome to summer! For many of us, that means more time outdoors and less time lost putting on and taking off multiple layers of clothing. That in turn means more time and tissue exposed to the single biggest cause of skin damage and cancer: ultraviolet radiation. Despite a flourishing market in sunscreens and, to a lesser extent, sun-protective clothing, as well as a dermatologists’ campaign going back to 1983, millions of Americans continue to abuse the rays that in small doses help maintain health but in larger doses can destroy it. And not just when the summer sun shines. For some who frequent tanning salons or own tanning beds, sun worship is a year-round activity. Dermatologists, whose incomes are bolstered by the fallout from UV abuse, nonetheless express great frustration with their seeming inability to deter tanning behavior, particularly among adolescents and young adults, who are most at risk for the ill effects from these otherwise life-giving rays. There are many explanations for this failure, including the widespread belief that people look better (read healthier and perhaps thinner) when they are tan. This notion has helped to foster the multibillion-dollar indoor tanning industry, supported by some young patrons as often as 20 times a month. But in recent years, another explanation has emerged for which there is now considerable scientific support: the idea that exposing one’s skin to UV radiation has addictive potential.
health,As with alcohol, not everyone who is exposed becomes  dependent on the sun. But there are enough UV abusers — one in five college students, perhaps half of beach habitués and 70 percent of indoor tanners, according to various studies — to warrant a new medical diagnostic category: tanning addiction. 3.5 Million Cases of Skin Cancer When Dr. Richard F. Wagner Jr., a dermatologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, reported five years ago  that as many as half of local beachgoers met the psychiatric definition of a substance abuse disorder, he received an e-mail message from a man in Canada who described himself as “a poster boy for your study.” The man said he traveled all over the world to maintain a tan, and even though he knew he could get cancer as a result, he could not stop. In a new report in The Skin Cancer Foundation Journal, Dr. Robin L. Hornung and Solmaz Poorsattar of the University of Washington in Seattle wrote that the “continued purposeful exposure to a known cancer-causing agent suggests that factors besides lack of knowledge are driving individuals to tan.” Although many say that a tanned appearance is their strongest motivation for sunbathing and tanning bed use, “tanners also report mood enhancement, relaxation and socialization” as their reasons, the authors wrote. And so the incidence of skin cancers, including potentially fatal melanoma, continues to rise. This year, 3.5 million new cases of superficial but often disfiguring skin cancers, and an estimated 68,720 melanomas, will be diagnosed among Americans.
health,Many people think a tan protects them by helping block the damaging effects of UV radiation. In fact, a tan represents skin damage. Even brief exposure to ultraviolet light can cause mutations in the DNA of skin cells, including the melanocytes, the host cells for melanoma. Accumulate enough of those mutations and a cancer can result. “As we age, the number of mutations increase and our immunity wanes,” Dr. Wagner explained — a double whammy that greatly increases the likelihood of skin cancer. Even those who escape cancer will eventually experience the aging effects of repeated tanning: loose, wrinkled, leathery skin that can make people look decades older than they are. My paternal grandmother, who lived a block from the beach in Brooklyn and swam daily in the years before sunscreens, had what we called “elephant skin” by her 50s. But my 90-year-old Aunt Gert, who lives nearby and winters in Florida but never went to the beach or sat in the sun, has the skin of a 60-year-old. Summarizing the mounting evidence for the addictive potential of UV radiation, Dr. Hornung said in an interview that frequent tanners showed signs of both physiological and psychological dependence. As with cigarette smoking and heavy drinking, which are “often practiced despite knowledge of their dangers,” she said, attempts to curtail UV abuse through education about its dangers seem to fall on deaf ears. Clearly, something else is driving the behavior, and for some people that something seems to be addiction.
health,In Dr. Wagner’s study, conducted with Dr. Molly M. Warthan and Tatsuo Uchida, two tests of substance abuse were administered to 145 people basking in the sun on Galveston Island Beach. One is a modified version of the test often used to root out alcohol addiction. It’s called CAGE, an acronym for four questions: Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on your tanning? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your tanning? Have you ever felt guilty about tanning? Have you ever felt you needed to tan first thing in the morning —  as an eye opener? The authors, who published their report in 2005 in The Archives of Dermatology, found that 26 percent of the beachgoers met the CAGE criteria for addiction. And in a second test, a modified version of the psychiatric profession’s official diagnostic criteria for a substance abuse disorder, 53 percent of the respondents scored positively. “Individuals who chronically and repetitively expose themselves to ultraviolet light to tan may have a novel type of ultraviolet-light substance-related disorder,” the report concluded. Release of pleasure-giving endorphins in the brains of UV abusers is the likely stimulus for tanning addiction, studies suggest. Withdrawal and Prevention Research by Dr. Steven R. Feldman and colleagues at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center demonstrated that frequent salon tanners experienced withdrawal symptoms when given the drug naltrexone, which blocks the pleasurable effects of narcotics. Frequent tanners, but not occasional tanning patrons, reported symptoms like nausea and jitteriness when naltrexone blocked their endorphins.
health,Dermatologists are uniformly in favor of strict regulations of tanning salons, especially prohibiting patronage by minors. Dr. Hornung (who told me she just lost a patient to melanoma — “a beautiful 45-year-old single mother of four children who had been an avid indoor tanner”) also advocates starting to teach children at a very early age to always use sunscreen and to avoid excessive sun exposure even when they do use it, since even the best sunscreens cannot fully prevent sun damage. Just as child-restraint laws fostered routine seat belt use in older children and adults, wise sun habits initiated in early childhood could carry over for a lifetime — and a longer life.

business/international,China’s Efforts Fail to Contain Market Plunge - The New York Times SHANGHAI —  As the Chinese stock market slumps, the country’s government has stepped in boldly, unveiling a series of measures to prop up shares. But those efforts have done little to stabilize the market, with stocks continuing to slide on Wednesday. The losses create a political and economic challenge for the nation’s leadership. Beijing could face social unrest if the sell-off accelerates, since tens of millions of ordinary investors have plowed their savings into the market. The psychological toll on investors, in turn, could erode consumer confidence, dragging down growth in the already slowing economy. “The stock market is connected to the real economy,” says Fraser Howie, a longtime Asia banker and co-author of “Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise.” “When you see such violent moves, you don’t know what kinds of ripples are going to come down.” The Chinese government is moving swiftly to prevent any broader fallout. The country’s central bank has made extra cash available to fund share purchases. Brokerage houses have been ordered to pump billions of dollars into the market. And government-backed funds have earmarked billions more to prop up the shares of flagging companies. The mess in China has not roiled global markets. That is partly because the “Chinese financial system is largely sealed off from the global financial system,” Derek Scissors, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said in a report.
business/international,For now, the action is domestically focused. China’s Communist Party leaders are trying to restore confidence and stabilize the market before things get too ugly at home, introducing new fixes nearly every day. On Wednesday, China’s Ministry of Finance pledged to “adopt measures to safeguard the stability of capital markets,” and in particular protect state-owned financial enterprises. The move signals that this broad-based effort is being directed from the very top echelons of the state. “There are no buyers, only sellers,” said Francis Cheung, a market analyst at CLSA, the brokerage house. “So the government is buying, and they’ll ramp up buying to stabilize the market.” Trouble is, they haven’t found the right formula. Despite the latest batch of moves, China’s markets were battered on Wednesday. In Shanghai, prices plunged 5.9 percent. In Shenzhen, they fell 2.5 percent. The damage is also spreading regionally, to Hong Kong and Japan, where shares also fell sharply. While the markets are up over all for the year, the recent downward spiral is creating substantial pain. Both major exchanges are off between 30 percent to 40 percent in six weeks, putting them in bear market territory. The numbers don’t give the complete picture either. In recent days, many stocks have been halted because of exchange rules that are supposed to guard against too much misery in a single trading session. At least a third of the companies listed on the major stock exchanges had trading in their shares suspended on Wednesday.
business/international,Those market dynamics can create a chain reaction of selling. China’s major exchanges prevent a stock from falling more than 10 percent on any given day. When that happens, analysts say, many investors opt for selling other shares, broadening the sell-off. Then when the market opens the next day, they continue selling down the stock that was previously halted, effectively prolonging the turmoil. “It just delays the correction, so it delays the downturn,” said Mr. Cheung at CLSA. While China’s stock markets have a long history of volatility, the environment is different now. The country’s economy has been sluggish. The stock market is far bigger than it has ever been, second in size only to that of the United States. And aggressive investors, many of them first-time buyers of equities, have been playing a different game. They were buying stocks with borrowed funds, using leverage as if they were “barbarians at the gate.” The panic, in part, is being driven by concerns about the huge amount of borrowing. Some analysts estimated that margin buying reached about $550 billion, or as much as 15 percent of the value of all tradable shares on the two major exchanges. Fear is gripping the market after a phenomenal bull run in which mainland China’s major stock indexes doubled, tripled and even quintupled over the past few years. By the time the market peaked, in early June, share prices in China were among the most expensive in the world, vastly costlier than in the United States, Europe or Hong Kong.
business/international,Investors in mainland China, in other words, had to pay a huge premium to buy domestic shares, a sign the country’s stock market was frothy. Some analysts have noted that the price-to-earnings ratio of companies listed on China’s start-up index, called ChiNext, were far higher than those listed on the Nasdaq stock market in 2000, when the Internet bubble burst. Just a few weeks ago, the pipeline of initial public stock offerings was robust. There was the promise of innovative companies that could use the capital markets, rather than the banks, as a source of cash, and the prospect of new bourses being set up for China’s technology start-ups. China’s state-run news media, including The People’s Daily, helped hype the rip-roaring market. As recently as April, news media said that the bull market had “just begun,” only to warn some weeks later of the risks. Since then, sentiment has soured, and investors have lost confidence. The worry, analysts said, is that it could be a prolonged downturn, like the one that began in 2007 and lasted about seven years. The sharp decline in prices wiped out trillions of dollars in value from a market that at one point topped $10 trillion. Still, the decline has not yet erased all, or even most, of the gains. China’s major exchanges remain up about 75 percent from a year ago, in part because big state-owned companies have fared better.
business/international,In late June, the government cut interest rates, which is ordinarily a good sign for stocks, since it makes them more attractive relative to bank deposits. But share prices fell anyway. Since then, the authorities have introduced a wave of additional measures meant to prop up prices. Stock trading transactions were slashed. I.P.O.s were suspended. Huge stabilization funds were set up to purchase shares. Brokerage houses promised to buy more. And China’s insurance regulator eased rules so that insurers could more easily invest in stocks. In the face of further selling, the government continued to introduce new measures on Wednesday. China’s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees the country’s big state corporations, ordered many such companies with public listings not to reduce holdings of their own stock. The China Securities Regulatory Commission even issued a notice encouraging major shareholders, directors and executives of companies to increase their holdings of their companies’ stock. The commission emphasized that rules about the timing of insider stock transactions that might deter such purchases would not apply. It’s a “trial and error” approach, said Patrick Ho, a market analyst at UBS in Hong Kong. And more measures could come, as the authorities look to stimulate the economy and try to keep the market from falling too rapidly.
dining,Pork That’s Fast on the Grill, and Flavorful Too - The New York Times Butterfly wings are delicate things, diaphanous and fragile and nothing at all like the large, fat-veined chunk of boneless pork loin I had spread out on my cutting board one recent afternoon. Yet I kept the butterfly in mind as I prepared the pork, slicing through the loin so I could quickly grill it to feed a crowd. I was, to use the butchering term, butterflying the loin, a very simple technique of cutting lengthwise through any thick boneless piece of meat until you’ve almost halved it, but not quite, leaving it attached on one side. When you open up the halves, they should resemble the symmetrical wings of a butterfly. At least in theory. With an oval chicken breast, this imagery holds if you squint a little. But with a cylindrical pork loin (or a lopsided leg of lamb for that matter), butterflies are merely a poetic notion. Another analogy is to think of opening the cut piece of meat like a book. In the case of a four-pound pork loin, picture a nice big tome — “Moby-Dick,” perhaps. The advantage of this kind of trimming is that the slimmed-down slab of meat will cook faster. For my pork loin, this means less than 30 minutes on the grill, instead an hour or more in the oven. (Do not substitute pork tenderloin, as it is an entirely different cut.)
dining,If you have access to a butcher, they can butterfly the meat for you. But if it’s the supermarket or bust, buy a boneless pork loin and cut it yourself. It’s not at all hard to do if you’ve got a sharp knife. I like to marinate butterflied pork loin with plenty of garlic, herbs, cumin and lemon. But you can adapt the basic cooking technique and flavor it any which way. Or leave it plain and porky, rubbing it down with salt and a little pepper. Just be sure to at least season the meat at least a few hours in advance. As the salt dissolves and forms a brine, it helps the pork retain its moisture. Then don’t overcook it. Pull the meat off the grill when it’s still medium rare (135 degrees on an instant-read thermometer) so it stays nice and juicy and beautifully pink in the center. A grilled pork loin may not be fluttery or delicate, but it’s hearty and luscious enough to satisfy a hungry crowd.

business/international,Congressional Panels Approve Fast Track for Trade Deal, With Conditions - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  House and Senate committees this week easily agreed to give President Obama fast-track authority to negotiate a sweeping trade accord with Pacific nations, but the package of bills intended to speed completion of the deal also imposes difficult burdens on its negotiators. Senators demanded tough limits on currency manipulation by trading partners of the United States and placed restrictions on the import of products made with child labor. One provision would prohibit consideration of trade agreements with any country considered a violator of human-trafficking rules, a seemingly noncontroversial addition. But it could knock Malaysia from the deal, a 12-nation accord still being negotiated known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Another provision would preclude trading partners from organizing boycotts, imposing sanctions or pressing divestment on Israel — popular here, less so in the Muslim countries in the deal. As the trade promotion authority bills head to the House and Senate floors in coming weeks, skeptics and opponents have made it clear they are not finished. “There’s not been a T.P.A. considered seriously by the House and Senate for 12 years, so this is something we take seriously,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who helped win passage of the currency manipulation amendment and promised many more proposals for the Senate floor.
business/international,The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday voted 25-13 on a bill that would give Congress the ability to vote yes or no on trade agreements, but without the ability to make amendments, over the next five years. Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican from Wisconsin, the committee’s chairman and an ardent trade supporter, kept his party in line and voted down substantive changes to the bill. Senate Republicans were less successful in defending a delicate fast-track compromise from significant changes. The Senate Finance Committee voted 20-6 for similar legislation late Wednesday night, but only after a bipartisan group of skeptics imposed new demands. The trade promotion measures already included strict and burdensome demands, including a four-month delay between the completion of a trade accord and consideration by Congress, and a two-month public comment period before the president could finally sign a deal. That delay is likely to push congressional consideration into the next presidential election season, an unappealing prospect for supporters. But Congress is also poised to raise the bar for negotiators. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew maneuvered for months to avoid a requirement that future trade accords include measures to prevent countries from artificially depressing their currencies, which make their exports cheaper and United States imports more expensive. The Obama administration worries that would backfire on the United States if trading partners objected to the Federal Reserve’s use of currency sales or purchases to spur American economic growth. Administration officials say currency issues should be dealt with delicately, by multilateral organizations like the Group of 20 largest industrial economic nations.
business/international,“The legislation raises questions about consistency with our international obligations, and other countries might pursue retaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters,” Mr. Lew wrote in a letter to Congress on Tuesday. Senators in both parties disagreed. The Finance Committee voted 18-8 to add a provision to force the Commerce Department to treat currency manipulation as an illegal export subsidy and impose duties to counter it. The amendment was added to a separate customs enforcement bill moving alongside the trade promotion authority legislation — a victory of sorts for the administration, which beat back a separate currency measure that was to be added to the trade bill. But lawmakers said they would move in coming weeks to merge the customs and trade promotion bills. “Because China is now stealing from our best industries and hurting us in tech and in pharma — it’s no longer just furniture and clothing, as important as they were — we have to do something,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. A surprise addition from Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was an innocuous-sounding “No Fast Track for Human Traffickers” amendment, which would prohibit expedited consideration of trade agreements with any country in the top tier of the State Department’s human trafficking list. Included in that list of 23 nations in Malaysia. Mr. Menendez said his amendment came up just hours after the Senate approved a new anti-human-trafficking bill 99-0, so administration officials should not have been surprised.
business/international,“It’s a very simple proposition: We shouldn’t give fast-track status to countries engaged in human trafficking,” he said. “They still can get involved. They just have to get their act together.” An administration official involved in the trade talks said the legislation had far to go before it reached the president’s desk. But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, made it clear the White House would oppose Mr. Menendez’s amendment. “Blocking agreements with countries like Malaysia removes an important and effective incentive for them to improve their practices,” the official said. The official added that the White House was working with Congress to find “responsible options with objective standards and strong potential remedies” to deal with the currency issue. But the official said the administration remained opposed to the Senate legislation. The White House has a strong ally in Mr. Ryan. The chairman maintained firm discipline on his committee in a formal drafting session on Thursday that took all day and produced virtually no change to the initial bill. Mr. Ryan, who ran against President Obama in 2012 as the Republicans’ vice-presidential nominee, found himself defending the president against attacks by his own party. “This is a strange world we’re in these days,” Mr. Ryan said.
world/middleeast,Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes - The New York Times JERUSALEM —  Clearly unsatisfied with assurances from President Obama about the provisions of the Iran nuclear deal, Israel on Monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government’s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the “better deal” that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed. But Mr. Steinitz’s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday. Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel’s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides. Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach.
world/middleeast,Mr. Steinitz’s tone was a bit different, saying the changes — including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations — would make the accord “more reasonable.” But the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal. So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, “is wrong.” “The alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,” he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. “It is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.” The Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb.
world/middleeast,In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out. The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:  An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.  A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.  The closing of the Fordo facility as an enrichment site, even if enrichment activities are suspended there. This was also an early United States objective. The compromise struck allows a small number of centrifuges to spin but bars the enrichment of uranium there; instead, other elements will be created for medical isotopes.
world/middleeast, Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with “possible military dimensions.” It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency — 11 of which it has declined to answer so far — before it would receive full sanctions relief.  A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.  “Anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism — the details of which are unclear — to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site. The reaction from Israel came after Mr. Obama’s assurances that the preliminary agreement was the “best bet by far” to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and his pledge to the Israelis that the United States had “got their backs.” The disagreements between Israel and the Obama administration over the Iran talks have severely strained the American-Israeli relationship in recent months, with the tone on both sides often confrontational. The White House was infuriated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to address a joint meeting of Congress in March in order to criticize the emerging agreement without consulting the White House.
world/middleeast,Despite Mr. Obama’s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” where he said: “I’m not trying to kill any deal. I’m trying to kill a bad deal.” Yet Israel’s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone. Mr. Halevy told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that “in order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.” Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. “I don’t know because the details have not been worked out.” he said. “There are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.” On Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, “not to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.”
world/middleeast,Referring to Mr. Obama’s explanation about inspections in an interview with Thomas L. Friedman, a New York Times columnist, Mr. Steinitz said it was “not good enough.” It was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence. But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a “sober analysis” of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran’s missile capability. As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government’s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement. “This is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn’t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it’s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “That will be an important part of our case moving forward.”
science,The Ant Queen Is Dead. Let the Battles Begin. - The New York Times The upheavals that take place in the highly social societies of insects would not be out of place in “Game of Thrones.” Queens die. New queens arise. Wars are fought. Slaves are taken. But when a queen dies in a colony of Indian jumping ants, Harpegnathos saltator, the result is truly bizarre, at once almost human and completely alien. In a typical colony of these ants, a queen has children and female workers work, taking care of the larvae and hunting for food. The queen sees to it that the female workers do not reproduce by emitting a chemical that keeps them submissive and sterile. When the queen dies, however, a tournament results. Female workers fight one another and a small group of them emerges as a new triumphant class to replace the queen. Their physiology changes, as does their behavior. Mating with their brothers in the colony, this new group of gamergates, as they are called, begin to reproduce. The ants, which live in flood plains in India, are called jumping ants because they leap at their prey with jaws wide open and lock onto the spider or hapless insect on which they have pounced. They keep well in the laboratory, said Clint A. Penick, who studied them at Arizona State University, so they are easy to study.
science,They are also big for ants, almost an inch long, and they are one of the few ant species that are keyed into visual cues. “When you walk into a lab they actually look at you,” he said. “It’s kind of like having a wolf-pack in a shoe box.” Dr. Penick, who is now at North Carolina State University, wanted to find out the biochemistry behind this unusual change in reproductive function. He and colleagues published their findings this month in The Journal of Experimental Biology. In many ants a substance called juvenile hormone is connected to changes in reproductive status. But not always. When Dr. Penick and colleagues tested the gamergates they found higher levels of dopamine, a brain chemical involved in reward circuits in human and other mammalian brains. So they set up artificial tournaments by putting together female workers without a queen or group of gamergates to suppress their reproductive behavior. Each ant had her own identifying color-code painted on like a coat of arms. Dueling and biting began and the aggressive ants showed increased levels of dopamine. They also found that if they moved an ant that had ramped-up dopamine levels related to tournament success to a colony with active gamergates or a queen, the female workers would engage in what is called policing behavior. Like mean girls, they would all gather round and bite down on the female who was stepping out of her role, holding her still for about 24 hours.
science,The result was a drop in dopamine levels and a return to submissive behavior and lack of fertility. The link between dopamine and dominance and aggression is not that surprising, but researchers would like to know whether it is a signal to start the physiological changes necessary to reproduce.

world/asia,ISIS Claims Deadly Attack on Shiite Mosque in Afghanistan - The New York Times KABUL, Afghanistan — Suicide attackers stormed a crowded mosque in Kabul during Friday Prayer, officials said, killing at least 20 people and wounding dozens of others in the latest in a series of deadly attacks against Shiites in Afghanistan. The Islamic State, which previously claimed deadly assaults against Shiite targets in the country, said its militants were behind the attack, according to the group’s Amaq news agency. Worshipers who had jumped out of windows and fled barefoot from the siege described scenes of panic and bloodshed after gunmen entered the compound in a residential area in the north of the city. The men stormed in after an explosion, believed to have been caused by grenades thrown at security guards at the entrance. Eidi Muhammad Akbari, who fled to safety, said that hundreds of people had been stuck inside. “Half of the mosque was full of worshipers — women upstairs and men downstairs, hundreds of men and women,” he said, pacing barefoot. “They threw a grenade inside and then entered.” Multiple heavy explosions were heard. As plumes of thick smoke rose above the mosque, witnesses said, the Afghan forces tore down a rear wall to rescue dozens of worshipers trapped inside. “I personally helped evacuate 20 dead bodies, many of them women,” said Sayed Hussain, who managed to get inside the mosque to look for his friends. “They had killed people wherever they found them.”
world/asia,Nearly four hours after it began, elite Afghan forces declared the siege was over. “We are still transferring casualties to hospitals,” said Mohammed Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry. He said that in addition to those killed, at least 40 others were wounded. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said three attackers were involved in the siege, which killed at least 10 civilians and three police officers. At least 30 civilians and police officers were wounded. “The police evacuated 107 people trapped in the mosque,” Mr. Danish said. But survivors said the death toll might be much higher. Mohammed Jawad Qurbani, who was trapped in the mosque for three hours before he was rescued by the police, said dozens of men and women tried to hide at the home of the mosque’s imam in the corner of the compound. “The attackers quickly went upstairs, where women were praying,” Mr. Qurbani said. Gunfire and explosions were heard as special forces, using drone cameras and accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs, scrambled to find a way into the compound. Their armored vehicles came under fire as they tried to go in the front entrance, one police officer said, and the forces sought to gain access through homes behind the mosque, even as residents tried to flee with their families. A mother arrived at the security cordon, wailing and begging the police to let her proceed toward the mosque. “My son is not answering the phone,” she said. “What do I do?”
world/asia,The police apologized and said they could not allow her to pass because fighting was underway. Deadly attacks against Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan have increased in recent months, and a local affiliate of the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for many of them. On Aug. 1, the group attacked a Shiite mosque in the western city of Herat during evening prayer, killing almost 40. Human Rights Watch, in a statement, said the deliberate targeting of a group of unarmed civilians in a place of worship amounted to a war crime. “This contemptible act against a religious minority, claimed by ISIS’s Afghan affiliate, is a grim reminder that civilians bear the brunt of Afghanistan’s war,” said Patricia Gossman, senior Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. The Taliban, which in the past have been behind other deadly attacks in the country, denied responsibility this time. “We are not involved in today’s attack on a mosque in the Khair Khana area of Kabul,” a Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said in a WhatsApp message. He attributed the attack to unidentified groups “that are trying to create discord within our nation.”

health,If You’re Sick, Stay Away From Work. If You Can’t, Here Is What Doctors Advise. - The New York Times When Elle Fraser, a business operations assistant for the New Jersey Devils, came down with the flu just before Thanksgiving last year, she didn’t think about staying home from work. The hockey team had home games on Wednesday and Friday that week, and she worried that her work would never get done without her, even if she had a 103-degree fever. She toughed it out, alternating between chills and sweats, falling asleep at her desk, wiping down every surface she touched, and insisting to co-workers she was wearing mittens to handle tickets only because she was cold. On that Wednesday, Ms. Fraser, 23, worked from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. On Thanksgiving Day, she slept most of the day. The next day, she went back to work, just as sick as she was on Wednesday. Sure, she technically had a choice to use a sick day and stay home, but that was not how she saw it. She thought she didn’t really have a choice. “Nobody tries to convince you to go home because they knew in that situation they’d be doing the same thing,” she said. Some people might read her account as a tribute to hard work and selflessness. Others might be aghast that she had risked exposing others to illness.
health,It’s clear on which side doctors come down: They say workers with the flu or a cold should use sick days far more often than they do. Though millions of Americans don’t get paid time off when they’re sick, those who do have the option often don’t take it. “If it’s bad enough that you’re wondering if you should stay home, you should probably stay home,” said Dr. Pritish K. Tosh, an infectious diseases researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Remember: It’s not just about you. Even if you can battle the flu by enduring a miserable week, it can be deadly for others, especially pregnant women, young children and older people. And no matter how many precautions you take, there’s no way to eliminate risk to people around you. As a general rule, Dr. Tosh suggested people stay home until they are fever-free for 24 hours. He said he stayed out of work for three or four days the last time he had the flu. “People can be infectious even before they start to have symptoms, but most of the time that they’re going to be most infectious is going to be when they are sickest, especially if they’re having fevers,” he said. Infectious germs are spread most frequently by airborne “respiratory droplets” from sneezing and coughing. The flu virus can last for up to 24 hours depending on the surface, Dr. Tosh said.
health,By coughing or sneezing into your hands, or wiping a runny nose, your hands can spread the germs to everything you touch — including surfaces many other people touch, such as door knobs, elevator buttons or shopping carts. “You’re never truly not contagious until all of those symptoms are resolved,” said Dr. David Shih, executive vice president of strategy, health and innovation at CityMD, which runs a chain of urgent care centers in New Jersey, New York and Washington. Let’s say you’re ignoring the doctors and going out into the world anyway. You’re not alone: A CityMD survey in August found that 69 percent of Americans with the flu or flulike symptoms said they went to the drugstore or a pharmacy, 43 percent said they went to the grocery store and 39 percent said they went to work. Millennials (76 percent) were far more likely than those 35 or older (56 percent) to have left the house the last time they were sick. Though you can’t eliminate the risk of infecting others, there are steps you can take to minimize it: • Get in the habit of coughing and sneezing into your elbow, not your hand. Children are being taught to cough like Dracula. • Limit your interaction with other people as much as possible. If you’re going to work, consider skipping nonessential meetings. • Avoid physical contact with other people, especially shaking hands. • Wipe surfaces down after touching them. • Use hand sanitizer or wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.
health,• Wear a mask to limit the respiratory droplets. • Take medication to reduce your symptoms. Oh, by the way, get your flu shot. Stay-at-home parents scoff at the idea of sick days, as do millions of other workers whose jobs don’t offer paid time off. “For people who are living paycheck to paycheck or have significant debt, the risks of staying home and losing pay or potentially losing their job are far too great,” said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies and strategies at the National Partnership for Women and Families. Low-income earners and part-time workers are especially likely to work while sick, including those at restaurants and hospitals. Ms. Shabo and advocates like her are pushing for laws mandating paid sick days, which are in place or will be soon in eight states, 30 cities and two counties. “It’s important from a public health perspective, and a workplace morale perspective, that people can take the time they need to recover,” she said.
business/economy,The U.S. Added 261,000 Jobs in October; Here’s the Upshot - The New York Times The hurricane-battered job market surged back to life in October, the government reported on Friday, the latest sign that the American economy has entered perhaps its strongest stretch of growth in years. Yet the latest round of jobs data did nothing to resolve the question that has bedeviled the economic recovery for years: When will job growth translate into strong wage gains for American workers? Average hourly earnings were 2.4 percent higher in October than a year earlier, barely keeping pace with inflation. Considering the tight labor market, with unemployment at its lowest level since Bill Clinton was president, many economists say the dividends have been paltry. “It’s certainly trending the right way, but it’s surely still unexciting — even unacceptable — wage growth at this point,” said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America. Employers added 261,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department said, the most in more than a year. A strong rebound in job creation had been expected after hurricanes in Florida and Texas kept tens or even hundreds of thousands of workers away from work — and off payrolls — in September. The storms’ effects were clearest in the weather-dependent leisure and hospitality sector, which lost 102,000 jobs in September, then gained them all back and more — 106,000 jobs — in October.
business/economy,The hurricanes’ damage to the labor market also was not quite as bad as initially believed. The Labor Department on Friday revised its estimate of September payrolls from a decline of 33,000 — the first net loss in jobs in seven years — to an 18,000-job gain. With the revision, the economy has now added jobs for 85 straight months, a record. Economists recommended setting aside both the September and October reports and instead focusing on the longer-term picture. The United States has been adding about 170,000 jobs a month this year, the slowest pace since 2010 but still a rate most economists consider fundamentally healthy. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell yet again to 4.1 percent, its lowest level since 2000. The labor force shed 765,000 workers in October, but most economists dismissed the drop as a correction after four straight months of gains. “The trend is rock-solid,” said Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody’s Analytics. “The labor market just continues to chug along, and it’s showing very little evidence of slowing.” Indeed, there are signs that the economy as a whole is gaining strength. Last week, the government reported that gross domestic product rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the second-straight quarter of solid growth. Consumer spending, the dominant driver of economic growth in recent years, has stayed strong: Retail sales posted a big gain in September, and consumer confidence hit a nearly 17-year high this week.
business/economy,But consumers are no longer alone in driving the economy forward. Stronger global growth (along with a weaker dollar) has led to higher demand for American goods and services in recent months, aiding the manufacturing sector and increasing exports. “It’s finally feeling like the economy is starting to fire on multiple cylinders rather than relying solely on consumers,” said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. President Trump hailed the strong jobs report on Friday afternoon, tweeting “JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!” Many economists, however, argue that the president deserves little credit for the strong job market, which predates his time in office. And the recent run of strong economic data could complicate the Republican argument that a tax cut is needed to promote economic growth. The solid jobs figures on Friday, combined with the other recent economic data, also make it likely that the Federal Reserve will push ahead with plans to raise interest rates despite sluggish inflation. The Fed this week left interest rates unchanged but hinted that it expected to raise rates at its December meeting unless the economy changes course. The strong economy, however, only adds to the enduring mystery of anemic wage growth. Average earnings actually fell slightly in October compared with September, and although that was partly a statistical quirk caused by the hurricanes, the slowdown was larger than most economists expected. The year-over-year pace of growth, at 2.4 percent, was the weakest since early last year.
business/economy,The problem is hardly a new one. Throughout the recovery, there have been predictions that wage growth would accelerate as unemployment fell. And throughout the recovery, those hopes have been dashed. Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, likened wage growth to a baseball team that keeps crushing fans’ hopes for a championship. “We’ll continue to ‘wait till next month’ for better growth in wages,” Mr. Hamrick said. “It’s been disappointing for years now.” There are hints of progress. Earnings growth, at least before adjusting for inflation, has accelerated a bit in recent years. And more sophisticated measures show somewhat stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index, a measure of compensation that considers benefits as well as cash pay, was up 2.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace in two and a half years. Some industries are seeing faster growth — and not just for high-earners. In recent months, there have been hints that wage gains are filtering down to workers in fast food and other low-wage industries. In September, the retail giant Target announced that it was raising pay for all its workers to at least $11 an hour and would pay at least $15 an hour by the end of 2020. That move, and others like it, is putting pressure on other low-wage employers to increase pay. “It’s really hard to retain employees when those companies are saying, ‘Any employee in our company is getting at least $15 an hour,’” said Jennifer Durham, chief development officer for Checkers and Rally’s, a drive-through burger chain with 860 locations across the country.
business/economy,So far, however, Checkers and Rally’s has resisted broad-based pay increases, choosing instead to focus on helping employees earn more through advancement. “Base pay is a starting point, but it’s not the entire proposition,” Ms. Durham said. Republicans in Washington in recent weeks have proposed their own solution to slow wage growth: lower taxes on businesses, which they argue would lead to big pay increases for workers. Many economists are skeptical that companies would pass tax savings on to workers, or argue that the benefits of the Republicans’ proposed tax plan would be far smaller than its authors claim. Instead, economists point to another factor holding back wage gains: productivity. Growth in productivity — how much workers can produce in an hour, on average — has been slow, making it harder for companies to improve wages without eating into profit margins. “It’s hard to get wages really taking off without productivity growth,” Mr. Ryan said. Productivity growth accelerated in the third quarter, though it is too soon to know whether the that represents the start of a longer-lasting rebound. And despite the disappointing pay data, there are signs that companies are being forced to work harder to attract employees, and to keep the ones they have from bolting to competitors. A report from the payroll-processing firm ADP this month found that people who switch jobs are seeing significant pay gains, which suggests workers are jumping ship in search of better opportunities.
business/economy,David Staszewski, executive vice president of sales for Wireless Zone, a cellphone retailer, said that over the last six months, the company’s franchisees had increasingly complained about holding on to workers. Many of them have had to raise pay or restructure commissions to keep employees, he said. “They’ll move at the blink of an eye and really not care,” Mr. Staszewski said. “A friend of theirs will call up and say, ‘Hey, it’s better over here,’ and they will up and leave.”
world/europe,François Fillon, Facing Calls to Quit French Race, Enjoys a Day of Gains - The New York Times PARIS — Monday was a day of reprieves for François Fillon, the embattled center-right candidate for president of France, who has been grappling with allegations of corruption and calls for him to drop out of the race. First came the end of a threat that Alain Juppé, a prominent rival, would challenge or even replace him as the standard-bearer of the center-right. Mr. Juppé announced in the morning that he had decided “once and for all” not to run. A second threat, that the Republicans party would publicly disavow Mr. Fillon, was averted later in the day. Top party officials emerged from a meeting in Paris to say that they had agreed unanimously to keep on supporting him. French news outlets reported that Mr. Fillon, who took part in the meeting, put his foot down, emphasizing that divisions within the party could not spread further. Even so, Mr. Fillon’s troubles are not over. With less than 50 days to go before the first round of voting on April 23, the rifts on the French right that have been exposed by the scandal surrounding Mr. Fillon are unlikely to heal before the presidential and legislative elections. Hundreds of Mr. Fillon’s former backers have distanced themselves from him, and some in his party continue to doubt that he can win now. But the developments on Monday seemed to bolster Mr. Fillon’s claims that there is no one suitable to replace him.
world/europe,“No one can stop me from being a candidate,” Mr. Fillon said on Sunday in an interview on the television channel France 2. Mr. Juppé, who is mayor of the southwestern city of Bordeaux, told reporters there on Monday that the presidential campaign had been dominated by “unprecedented” confusion. “What a waste,” he said, accusing Mr. Fillon of squandering the center-right party’s chances of winning. Mr. Juppé, a moderate, ran in the Republicans’ presidential primary in November but lost to Mr. Fillon, who campaigned on a harder line. He criticized Mr. Fillon on Monday for his “obstinacy,” and he called Mr. Fillon’s dismissive response to the corruption allegations against him “a dead end.” But Mr. Juppé, 71, said he was not the man to replace Mr. Fillon now. He said that French voters were hungry for new political faces untainted by scandals, and that he did not quite fit the bill. “It is too late for me,” he said. Mr. Fillon, who like Mr. Juppé is a former prime minister, won primaries on the right and center-right in November, led in the polls and appeared to be on track to reach the second round of voting, where he would have a good chance to defeat his likely opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. But Mr. Fillon’s campaign was upended by reports in the satirical and investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné that his wife and two of his children were paid with taxpayer money to be parliamentary aides, posts that might not have involved much genuine work.
world/europe,The reports prompted an investigation by financial prosecutors, and they deeply dented Mr. Fillon’s standing in the polls, dropping him to third place behind Ms. Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, an independent candidate and a former economy minister. Mr. Fillon said last week that judges investigating the embezzlement allegations had summoned him for questioning on March 15. But he defiantly vowed to continue running, even if, as expected, he is formally charged. That defiance turned what, until then, had been mostly uneasy grumbling into a cascade of defections, with more than 300 backers dropping their support for Mr. Fillon and calling for the Republicans to find a new candidate. An allied party, the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents, also dropped its support for Mr. Fillon. Nicolas Sarkozy, a former president who also lost to Mr. Fillon in the primaries, said in a statement Monday morning that he wanted to organize a meeting with Mr. Fillon and Mr. Juppé to find a “dignified and credible way out of a situation that can no longer last.” So far, Mr. Fillon has dug in his heels. At a rally organized on Sunday in Paris, he lashed out at those calling for him to drop out. “They think I’m alone; they want me to be alone,” a combative Mr. Fillon told the crowd as he stepped on stage at the Trocadéro, across from the Eiffel Tower. “Am I alone?” he asked, and the crowd roared.
world/europe,“If, by magic, the French had been able to witness what I’ve seen these last weeks, a wave of disgust would submerge them,” Mr. Fillon said, denouncing “those who desert the sinking ship.” Mr. Fillon has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the scandal. His wife, Penelope, spoke publicly on Sunday about the matter for the first time since it broke, telling the newspaper Journal du Dimanche that she had carried out “very different tasks” for her husband as a parliamentary assistant, including writing memos and press reviews. Ms. Fillon also said she had urged her husband to continue his campaign, as did the thousands of supporters who stood under pouring rain Sunday afternoon in Paris, waving French flags and chanting for Mr. Fillon to “hold fast” because “France needs you.” “It’s the union between the people and the future president,” Franck Patti, 53, a project manager for the city of Paris, said about the rally. A core faction of Republican rank-and-file voters have stood by Mr. Fillon, dismissing the allegations against him and warning that they could stay home on Election Day if he were to drop out. “The Republicans must see that Fillon is their natural candidate,” Mr. Patti said.
world/americas,U.N. Plans Reforms to Stamp Out Sexual Abuse by Peacekeepers - The New York Times UNITED NATIONS — Faced with persistent allegations of sexual abuse by United Nations peacekeepers, the new head of the world body is proposing to stop paying countries that fail to investigate claims against their soldiers “in a timely manner,” and to put that money instead into a trust fund to assist survivors. In what he calls “a new approach,” the secretary general, António Guterres, also wants all United Nations personnel to attest, in writing, that they understand the policy against sexual exploitation and abuse, which includes paying for sex. In addition, he intends to develop a new set of rules to prevent sexual abuse by peacekeepers — possibly including “prohibitions on the consumption of alcohol.” The proposals, contained in a draft report obtained by The New York Times, are scheduled to be publicly released Thursday. Allegations of sexual abuse, including against children and other vulnerable civilians in some of the world’s most troubled spots, have long dogged the world body, and have come under increased scrutiny over the last few years. Both Mr. Guterres and his predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, vowed to tackle the problem, and last year the United Nations began to identify countries whose troops were accused. In 2015, Mr. Ban fired the head of a peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic, where some of the most serious allegations had emerged.
world/americas,But those efforts have done little to stamp out the problem. In 2016, the number of accusations against military and civilian personnel increased from previous years, affecting 311 “known victims,” according to the report. And, despite stepped-up reporting of abuse cases, the numbers still may not reflect a complete toll of victims. “We feel certain that not all cases are reported,” the report warns. About half the victims last year were children, according to a new public database created by the United Nations. The largest number of allegations are against peacekeeping troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country whose own conflict has been marked by astonishingly high rates of rape. Several survivors have filed paternity claims against United Nations personnel. In cases of soldiers who are accused, the United Nations itself cannot investigate the allegations. That is up to the peacekeepers’ home countries, which vary widely in their willingness to hold their troops accountable, and to inform the world body of the results of any inquiry. Mr. Guterres, who took over as the secretary general in January, is under pressure to deliver results. Not only has sexual abuse by peacekeepers tarnished the reputation of the organization as a whole, it has also drawn the scrutiny of lawmakers in the United States, the country that pays for more than a quarter of the body’s peacekeeping budget. The report proposes the creation of a new assistant secretary general-level position to serve as a victims’ advocate at United Nations headquarters “to ensure that every victim receives appropriate care, follow-up attention, and information on the progress of his or her case.”
world/americas,Mr. Guterres said he also plans to appoint victims’ advocates in the four peacekeeping missions where the highest number of allegations have been reported: Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti and South Sudan. Among the report’s recommendations are a new set of rules with the aim of preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. “The protocol could also include prohibitions on the consumption of alcohol,” the report states, “and a requirement for individual written attestations to confirm that the individual understands the values and principles of the United Nations.” Some of the proposals are notable in that they are not already in place. The report says the United Nations would more carefully screen job candidates to ascertain whether there are outstanding allegations against them in another part of the organization’s system. And all staff members would be required to acknowledge in writing every year “that they are aware of our standards, that they personally commit to them, and that they understand fully the consequences of failing to do so.” Some of the most contentious proposals — such as withholding reimbursements to countries for their peacekeepers — would need to be approved by the General Assembly, and many countries are likely to push back. A trust fund has been set up to assist survivors. So far, only $436,000 has been contributed from five countries: Bhutan, Cyprus, India, Japan and Norway.
arts/dance,Mariana Valencia’s ‘Album’ Moves Toward Biography - The New York Times The choreographer Mariana Valencia has been thinking about her personal history — or, as she calls it, herstory. In her new work, “Album” — a compilation of dance, monologue and song — she approaches making performance as assembling notes for a future biographer. Dance is often romanticized for its ephemerality, but Ms. Valencia, shaping her own narrative, intends to leave a record. On Friday, April 7, Ms. Valencia unveils what she has developed in the first half of a two-year residency at Brooklyn Arts Exchange. At an early showing in November, she imbued even melancholic moments with her terse, inviting sense of humor, switching matter of factly between tasks. One section honored the Haitian-born poet and performance artist Assotto Saint, who died of AIDS in 1994, while another found her singing a euphoric ode to rice. Ms. Valencia likens the piece to both a photo album and a music album. By the end, a stranger has become a friend. (bax.org)
sports/baseball,As Opening Day Approaches, Mets Must Clarify Roles for Three Pitchers - The New York Times JUPITER, Fla. — The Mets’ decision makers will meet Tuesday to discuss the final shape of the season-opening roster. Among the most pressing topics will be what roles to assign Steven Matz, Zack Wheeler and Seth Lugo. A day after the Mets revealed that Matz had been dealing with soreness and irritation in his throwing elbow, he made 55 throws from flat ground. The discomfort wore off the more Matz threw, Mets Manager Terry Collins said. Matz said he tried to shorten his arm swing when throwing because Dan Warthen, the pitching coach, had noticed an atypical motion in his pitching that could be contributing to the problem. Matz also said doctors believed that the discomfort could have been related to surgery he had in October to remove bone spurs from the elbow. Collins said it was unclear if Matz could be ready for the start of the season next week. Wheeler or Lugo could fill Matz’s spot in the rotation, or they could be assigned to the bullpen. Wheeler could even remain in extended spring training if the Mets choose to act cautiously. And they might, considering that Wheeler has missed the past two seasons recovering from Tommy John surgery and will be on an innings limit in 2017. In the Mets’ 5-0 split-squad win over the Miami Marlins in Jupiter on Monday, Wheeler turned in his best outing of spring training: five scoreless innings, three strikeouts and two hits allowed on 70 pitches. His fastball velocity was 94 to 96 miles per hour.
sports/baseball,“He’s made huge strides in such a short time,” Collins said. Wheeler added: “Today proved that I am ready. Whether I start out the season or come in later, it doesn’t matter to me. I’ve only got 100-something innings.” Lugo, on the other hand, sputtered in his first start back with the Mets after a strong showing in the World Baseball Classic, where he played for Puerto Rico. He helped save the Mets’ 2016 season with strong pitching in the second half, but Lugo allowed four runs over four and one-third innings against the Washington Nationals in a 6-0 loss in Port St. Lucie. His role, at least to start the season, could be clarified on Tuesday, along with the status of Matz and Wheeler. “We’ve got to consider what’s best for the player and best for the organization,” Collins said. “This is no time to experiment. This is the time to win games.”
travel,Guide to Being Bumped (or Not) - The New York Times ONE hundred twenty-two seats. One hundred twenty-eight passengers waiting to board. Someone’s going to be bumped. That travel nightmare may play out more frequently this year as airlines continue to cut capacity in an effort to keep up with rising fuel prices, leaving fewer seats for passengers. Last month, Delta said it would cut 25 percent of its flights departing from its Memphis hub and is reducing capacity on some trans-Atlantic routes. US Airways said capacity later this year could be down 1 percent. And United, which is in the process of merging with Continental, said it would reduce domestic capacity by 4 percent at the end of the summer. Airlines regularly overbook flights to help offset no-shows and to ensure that flights are packed with paying customers. Last year, out of 595 million passengers, about 681,100 were denied seats on planes, according to the Department of Transportation. Most of those people volunteered to give up their seats in return for some form of compensation, like a voucher for a free flight. But D.O.T. statistics also show that about 1.09 of every 10,000 passengers was bumped involuntarily. Airlines are required to ask people who are not in a hurry to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation, before passengers who do not want to give up their seats are kicked off. But with capacity cuts, getting customers to volunteer is tricky. Full planes mean that the next flight out with an open seat might not be until the next day or even the next.
travel,Still, there are some travelers who see the flight crunch as a lucrative opportunity. Among them is Ben Schlappig. The 20-year-old senior at the University of Florida said he earned “well over $10,000” in flight vouchers in the last three years by strategically booking flights that were likely to be oversold in the hopes of being bumped. “I don’t remember the last time I paid over $100 for a ticket,” he boasted. His latest coup: picking up $800 in United flight vouchers after giving up his seat on two overbooked flights in a row on a trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Or as he calls it, “a double bump.” Obviously not your typical traveler, Mr. Schlappig is among a small, but passionate group obsessed with accruing frequent-flier miles. An elite flier on United, American and other carriers, he regularly makes “mileage runs,” crisscrossing the continent in a day with multiple airport stops simply to rack up miles, a pursuit he chronicles (writing under the name Lucky) on the One Mile at a Time blog on BoardingArea.com, which is geared to road warriors. Along the way, he deliberately seeks out flights he thinks will be oversold. “Every time I book a ticket, in the back of my mind is which flight has the best chance of being bumped,” he said. His strategies — which include booking the last flight of the day, telling the check-in clerk or gate agent that he is willing to give up his seat even before an announcement has been made and praying for bad weather — have already earned him more than $2,800 in flight vouchers so far this year. But his experiences also provide some education for travelers looking for ways to avoid being bumped.
travel,Below, insider tips to the bumping game. In most cases, do the opposite if you want to keep your seat. Be the first in line. Tell the check-in clerk or gate agent that you may be willing to give up your seat. That way you will be first on the list if they need volunteers. Alternatively, passengers who don’t want to be bumped should check in early to help ensure a seat. If a flight is oversold, the last passengers to check in are often the first to be bumped. Fly through hubs. Be aware that flying through busy hubs at peak times increases your chances of getting kicked off a flight. To up his chances of being bumped, Mr. Schlappig said he opts for flights through Chicago O’Hare, a busy hub, in late afternoon, when many international flights are scheduled to arrive. “They assume some people will get stuck at immigration and people will misconnect because a flight is late,” he explained. “If I see all the flights from Europe are coming in on time, I know they will need five or so volunteers.” Take the red-eye. As delays and cancellations build up on any given day, those last flights out can quickly fill up with displaced passengers, increasing your odds of getting bumped. “Gate agents call them cleanup flights,” said Mr. Schlappig, who scored a $400 voucher and a hotel room by volunteering to give up his seat last month on an overbooked red-eye from Los Angeles to Washington.
travel,Choose the right airline and the right day. You have a better chance of landing an oversold plane by flying American Eagle, which had the worst bumping rate (or the best, if you’re trying to be bumped) last year — 4.02 involuntary denied boardings per 10,000 passengers. JetBlue, which prides itself on rarely overbooking its planes, bumped the fewest passengers. In general, busy flying days like Monday, Friday and Sunday as well as holiday travel periods can also up your chances of being bumped. Check the weather. Mr. Schlappig intentionally flies in December, January and February through Washington, Chicago and Denver because of the potential for winter storms. Weather-related cancellations, he said, often result in overbookings as airlines work to accommodate passengers. Know the rules. Passengers who are involuntarily bumped and rebooked on another flight within two hours after their original domestic flight time (within four hours for international) are entitled to $400 in cash under Department of Transportation rules. As a volunteer, don’t accept any flight vouchers worth less. In November, Delta added a new twist by accepting bids from passengers willing to give up their seats on oversold flights. At a check-in kiosk, for example, passengers can input the dollar amount they would accept for volunteering to be bumped. But they could end up being outbid by a passenger who is willing to accept less for giving up a seat.
travel,Ask for more. The more desperate the airline is to get people off the plane, the more bargaining power you are likely to have. Will the airline provide free meals, a hotel room or an airline lounge pass? Most airlines give their staff the authority to up the ante when a flight is oversold and volunteers are few to none. One exception: United standardized its voluntary bumping compensation last year, offering a flat rate of $400 in travel vouchers to those willing to give up a seat on a domestic flight. Be nice. Being polite amid the chaos of an oversold flight can go a long way. “You don’t want to nag the agent for an upgrade when 20 people are on line,” said Mr. Schlappig, who will occasionally ask for an upgrade for giving up his seat after the oversold flight departs. “Gate agents don’t care who you are, they care how you treat them,” he said. “If you treat them with respect and you’re easygoing, it makes all the difference.”
world/europe,‘Brexit’ Threatens Subsidies for U.K.’s Landed Gentry, and Queen - The New York Times SANDRINGHAM, England — It is a club that includes some of the world’s richest people. There are dukes, sheikhs, flamboyant entrepreneurs — even Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family. What they have in common besides ownership of some of Britain’s finest estates — adorned with stately homes, manicured gardens and, sometimes, racing stables — is their legal status as farmers, which means they are on the dole for European Union farm subsidies. The queen’s idyllic 20,000-acre estate at Sandringham is among the huge holdings supported by the annual payouts, receiving more than $675,000 in European farm subsidies last year (down from $975,000 the year before). But that could be about to change because of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. The idea that public subsidies help the rich get richer may be unpopular, but while payments can be tracked on an official website, the decisions on them have been sheltered from view by the European Union’s much criticized Common Agricultural Policy. Once Britain is out of the bloc, however, the British Parliament will inherit the politically explosive issue of underwriting some of the cost of maintaining the estates of wealthy landowners. At a time when even the Conservatives under Prime Minister Theresa May have declared war on the growing wealth inequality and the inequities of capitalism, there is a rising clamor to stop, or at least curb, the handouts to the titled, and entitled.
world/europe,“It’s completely indefensible,” said Chris Bryant, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker, former minister and author of the coming “Entitled, a Critical History of the British Aristocracy.” “The only way we have been able to defend it in the past is that it is a European Union system,” he said. The British government has, Mr. Bryant added, “for years argued that we spend too much on agriculture, and the logical consequence of that would be not to have such high subsidies.” Recipients include a cast of the rich and famous, with money finding its way to another prominent member of the royal family via the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate established by Edward III in 1337. Its revenues go to Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, an heir to the throne. In 2016, the duchy received more than $130,000 in European Union subsidies. Other wealthy beneficiaries have included the Duke of Westminster, who died last year; the Duke of Northumberland; Khalid Abdullah al-Saud, owner of the Juddmonte racing stables; Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai, who owns the Godolphin stables; and James Dyson, the pro-Brexit businessman and inventor known for his vacuums, who also owns a farming business. The government has promised to retain current subsidies until 2022, but dropped strong hints that thereafter, the rich might have to pay more of their own way.
world/europe,In July, Michael Gove, the secretary of state for food, the environment and rural affairs, criticized a European farm subsidy system that “rewards size of landholding ahead of good environmental practice, and all too often puts resources in the hands of the already wealthy rather than into the common good of our shared natural environment.” Decisions have yet to be made, but ministers are studying ways to shift cash from farmers with large estates to those struggling with smaller holdings. Buckingham Palace said the subsidies for Sandringham also included payments for a separate estate, Balmoral, in Scotland, but it would not comment on what might happen after Brexit. In a statement, it said that “subsidies are open to all farmers; and like others with agricultural interests, some subsidies are received on the queen’s private estates. Figures are in the public domain as a matter of record.” But at Sandringham recently, where the public can walk through the queen’s house, view prized portraits and heirlooms — including shotguns and other antique weaponry — visitors seemed less than convinced that the cash was needed. Linda Thorpe, a health administrator, argued that while the Sandringham farm supported livelihoods, farmers generally got too much subsidy. Her husband, Colin Thorpe, was more blunt, saying: “Money always goes to money. That will never change.” Kevin Kilkenny, who trains apprentices in Hull, in northeast England, added: “It’s the old boys’ club. It is all the rich boys in the rich club looking after each other.”
world/europe,Brussels has tried several times to limit the maximum amount that farmers can claim, and individual governments are already entitled to impose curbs on big payments. But such initiatives have often clashed with Britain’s national interest. As a big net contributor to the European Union, it believed it got a raw deal from Europe’s agricultural policy because Britain has less farmland than, for example, neighboring France. Yet, of the subsidy that does flow to Britain, a significant proportion goes to owners of bigger parcels of land, who form a relatively large part of the nation’s farmers. The European Union has been scaling back its agricultural policy and trying to reward better environmental practices. Its defenders argue that farm subsidies help provide food security while sustaining the economies of remote rural communities that have few alternative sources of income. But Dieter Helm, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in energy, utilities and the environment, argues that rewarding people for owning land is “a terrible policy.” Though he opposes Brexit, he argues that “when we leave the European Union, the one shining opportunity is that we don’t have to be involved in this.” Professor Helm says that the British government will either devote less money to farm subsidies over all or distribute the funds differently, and that there will be a ceiling on subsidy grants to individual claimants. “There is enormous pressure, rightly, to stop subsidizing the large intensive farms of the lowlands,” he said. “There is a natural evolution away from paying people who have several thousand acres and toward the smaller farms, which tend to be in the uplands. It’s a no-brainer.”
world/europe,Some critics counter that cutting subsidies would put British farmers at a disadvantage, vis-à-vis their continental competitors, and that large landowners may break up their holdings into smaller plots of land to get around curbs on big beneficiaries. Professor Helm argues that tariffs could be applied to food imports if British farmers cannot compete, and that splitting up holdings to keep subsidies could be treated like tax evasion. As for Queen Elizabeth, David McClure, the author of “Royal Legacy,” a book on the monarchy’s finances, argues that even though Sandringham has historically struggled to make a profit, the queen’s finances are solid enough to survive a loss of the subsidies. “She’s not going to be pawning the family silver,” Mr. McClure said. Before last year’s British referendum on quitting the European Union, The Sun newspaper claimed that the queen supported Brexit. Buckingham Palace denied it, and a media standards watchdog later described the article’s headline as misleading. Either way, royal courtiers have woken up to some consequences of the Brexit vote. The latest annual report submitted by the Duchy of Cornwall said that Brexit had “caused some uncertainty,” noting that planning had become harder because “the circumstances around many decisions are bound to change.”
us/politics,Spending Bill Passes, Averting a Shutdown - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  With only hours to spare on the last day of the fiscal year, Congress averted a government shutdown on Wednesday by approving a temporary spending measure to keep federal agencies operating through Dec. 11. In the House, the legislation was approved only because of strong support by Democrats — a sign of how angry rank-and-file Republicans remain over their powerlessness to force policy changes on the Obama administration. The House vote was 257 to 151, with 186 Democrats and 91 Republicans in favor. All of the “no” votes were by Republicans. In one last display of their fury, House Republicans on Wednesday adopted another resolution to cut off government financing to Planned Parenthood. The resolution was to be sent to the Senate, where Democrats were certain to block it. Ultimately, the internal Republican fight over the bill and how strongly to confront the White House cost John A. Boehner his job as speaker. While Mr. Boehner’s resignation announcement last week essentially assured Democratic support for the measure, the bill does nothing to resolve the core disputes over fiscal policy between Republicans and President Obama, setting up even larger and potentially more calamitous battles in the months ahead. Congressional Democrats and Obama administration officials said they were eager to begin negotiations with Republicans on a longer-term spending measure. It is far from clear, however, that any deal can be reached soon, given the upheaval in the House.
us/politics,The White House said Mr. Obama would sign the temporary measure but also chastised the Republican-controlled Congress. “The American people deserve better than last-minute, short-term legislating,” the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, wrote in a statement. “There’s no reason that we should deny American families and businesses the certainty and support they need by kicking the can down the road again.” Republicans have pointedly blamed Congressional Democrats for blocking all efforts to adopt the regular annual spending bills, and the White House has consistently made clear that Mr. Obama would veto any measures that reflected solely Republican fiscal priorities. The temporary spending measure will keep the government operating at roughly last year’s levels — a rate of about $1.017 trillion a year, with some notable changes for emergency situations, such as $700 million to fight wildfires in the West. In the larger debate, Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats are pushing to lift spending caps agreed to in previous fights, saying they are constraining economic growth and job creation. Republicans are generally opposed to increasing spending, but some are pushing for more military spending. At the very least, these Republicans say, there should be negotiations to readjust spending priorities. Among the issues that the White House and Republicans must confront are a potential need to raise the federal debt ceiling to avoid a first-ever default, the expiration of many highway programs at the end of October, the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and the need for a longer-term spending accord.
us/politics,While Mr. Boehner has expressed a desire to do as much as possible before he leaves Congress at the end of October — “I don’t want to leave my successor a dirty barn,” he said — it seems unlikely that many of the big issues can be resolved before his departure. The House is scheduled to be in session for only 13 days in October. There is a weeklong recess for Columbus Day, and there will be several distractions. Not only do House Republicans need to choose new leadership next week, but on Oct. 22, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, will be on Capitol Hill to testify before the Select Committee on Benghazi. Asked how much Mr. Boehner would be able to accomplish, Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, replied, “Less than he thinks.” Earlier on Wednesday, the Senate approved the temporary spending bill by a vote of 78 to 20. Because of the unpredictability in the House, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had taken the unusual step of having the Senate act first on the spending measure. Continuing the bitter debate over spending on the Senate floor, each party blamed the other for forcing the government to the edge of a shutdown. Mr. McConnell noted again that Democrats had blocked all 12 spending bills that were approved by the Appropriations Committee. It was “part of some arbitrary strategy,” he said, “to force our nation to the brink.”
us/politics,Mr. McConnell said Democrats should shift tactics if they want to achieve a broader fiscal agreement. “I think the American people are ready for our colleagues to finally get serious and get back to work,” he said. He added, “Moving forward will require Democrats to turn the page on bad habits and dysfunction.” The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, noted Mr. Boehner’s resignation and described the Republicans as being in disarray. “He’s resigning because he knows he can’t deal with these people,” Mr. Reid said. “We have to do better than just keeping the federal government operating by a continuing resolution,” he added. “We have to stop devastating sequester cuts from hitting our military and our middle class.” Mr. Reid warned that the fight over raising the federal debt ceiling would be more urgent than the spending fight. “We all know that in a matter of weeks, unless we act, the United States will lose its ability to pay its bills,” he said. “If you think shutting the government down is bad, and I do, it pales in comparison to the government defaulting on all its debts.” As the day drew to a close, there were signs that the hard-line House Republicans, who had pushed for Mr. Boehner’s resignation, remained hungry for additional change. “I am disappointed that despite the gruesome and incontrovertible video evidence of Planned Parenthood’s activities, the president got his way and nothing changed,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. “Taxpayers are tired of being treated this way, and they are fed up with politics as usual.”
us/politics,Airstrikes by Russia Buttress Turkey in Battle vs. ISIS - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support Turkey’s offensive in northern Syria against the Islamic State, an important evolution in a budding Russian-Turkish partnership. The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria’s ultimate fate. The air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlin’s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic State’s self-declared capital. The Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24 attack plane that had violated Turkey’s airspace. Russia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a cease-fire in Syria — one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y.P.G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria.
us/politics,Some analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the country’s major cities to the south. “The Russian-Turkish rapprochement is largely tactical,” said James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. “Russia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime. And it allows Russia to exploit the U.S. shift to Turkey’s rival, the Y.P.G., by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State, which the U.S. inexplicably is not providing.” President-elect Donald J. Trump has spoken positively, though in vague terms, about the possibility of cooperating with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the Obama administration’s efforts to forge a common political and military strategy with the Kremlin on Syria collapsed after Russia supported Syrian forces and Iranian-backed fighters with its air power in the brutal retaking of Aleppo. Turkey began the operation at Al Bab, east of Aleppo, without coordinating with the United States and without the benefit of American airstrikes. “This is something that they’ve decided to do independently,” Col. John Dorrian, the spokesman for the American-led operation against the Islamic State, said in November.
us/politics,Turkey appeared to have assumed that it would make short work of the Islamic State fighters there. But the fighting has been stiff. In late November, the Turkish military’s problems were compounded when three of its soldiers were killed in what Turkish forces said was a Syrian airstrike. Mr. Erdogan later spoke by phone with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who assured him that Russia had not been involved in the air attack, according to Turkish news reports. The improving ties between the two autocratic leaders opened the door to greater cooperation. The Turkish military spoke publicly about the Russian role in a Jan. 2 statement that noted that Russian warplanes had struck targets the previous day about five miles south of Al Bab. American officials, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing intelligence, said that Russian airstrikes in the Al Bab area began at the end of December, and that Russian aircraft were flying near Al Bab as recently as Friday. The effectiveness of the Russian air operations, which have mainly involved dropping “dumb,” or unguided, bombs, is unclear. As Turkey’s casualties have mounted in the Al Bab operation, Turkish officials have complained about the lack of American air support and have even made veiled threats that Turkey might suspend allied combat flights against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria from its major base at Incirlik, which would be a major blow to the American-led air campaign.
us/politics,American officials suggested that the holdup in carrying out allied airstrikes in recent weeks was related to a Turkish decision to ban the Americans from flying reconnaissance drones in and around Al Bab to help identify and confirm targets, as well as bad weather. The Turkish military said that measure was needed to ensure that no potentially hostile aircraft flew over its troops, but it has hampered the United States’ ability to carry out airstrikes without endangering civilians. Operating without the benefit of precise intelligence, the United States recently engaged in what officials called a “show of force” operation in which American aircraft flew low over Al Bab and dropped flares. But last week, the Turks agreed that the United States could fly drones and other aircraft to gather intelligence, which paves the way for the American-led coalition to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Al Bab, American officials said. The United States regards the Kurdish forces as some of the most effective fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. But in deference to Turkish sensitivities, the Americans have declined to arm them directly. The Turks, however, regard them as nothing more than an arm of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an insurgent Kurdish group in Turkey and Iraq. The Turks have blamed the group for killing dozens of Turkish security forces in recent weeks.
us/politics,By any measure, the nascent cooperation between Russia and Turkey is a striking development. The situation was far different when Russian warplanes arrived at Latakia, Syria, in September 2015 to help the Assad government take on rebel groups, including some backed by the United States and Turkey. Relations were thrown into a crisis after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24 attack plane and the Russian pilot was fatally shot by Syrian rebels as he was parachuting down. Mr. Putin denounced the shoot-down as a “stab in the back.” Russia responded by deploying the S-400, an advanced air-defense system, at Latakia, and imposed economic sanctions against Turkey. But over the past year, the calculations of the two countries have changed. While President Obama warned that Syria would become a Russian military “quagmire,” the Russians, working with Iran, Iranian-backed forces and the Syrian military, helped Mr. Assad take back Aleppo in the waning months of the Obama administration without substantial Russian casualties. Still, Russia has to reckon with the fact that the Syrian military lacks the troops to control all of the country. At the same time, Turkey’s immediate objectives have shifted. Worried about the possibility that Kurdish fighters might link up separate cantons to establish an autonomous enclave across northern Syria, as well as about the presence of Islamic State fighters near its borders, Turkey sent its own forces into northern Syria in August.
us/politics,The Turkish offensive, which has enlisted the support of Syrian opposition groups that Turkey has backed, succeeded in taking the town of Jarabulus. But it has become bogged down near Al Bab, the last major town west of Raqqa still held by the Islamic State. The Russians notified the United States about the flights using a special hotline between Russian forces in Syria and the American air war command at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The hotline’s goal is to “deconflict” air missions carried out by the Russians and the American-led coalition.
dining,Unfiltered Fervor: The Rush to Get Off the Water Grid - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — At Rainbow Grocery, a cooperative in this city’s Mission District, one brand of water is so popular that it’s often out of stock. But one recent evening, there was a glittering rack of it: glass orbs containing 2.5 gallons of what is billed as “raw water” — unfiltered, untreated, unsterilized spring water, $36.99 each and $14.99 per refill, bottled and marketed by a small company called Live Water. “It has a vaguely mild sweetness, a nice smooth mouth feel, nothing that overwhelms the flavor profile,” said Kevin Freeman, a shift manager at the store. “Bottled water’s controversial. We’ve curtailed our water selection. But this is totally outside that whole realm.” Here on the West Coast and in other pockets around the country, many people are looking to get off the water grid. Start-ups like Live Water in Oregon and Tourmaline Spring in Maine have emerged in the last few years to deliver untreated water on demand. An Arizona company, Zero Mass Water, which installs systems allowing people to collect water directly from the atmosphere around their homes, began taking orders in November from across the United States. It has raised $24 million in venture capital. And Liquid Eden, a water store that opened in San Diego three years ago, offers a variety of options, including fluoride-free, chlorine-free and a “mineral electrolyte alkaline” drinking water that goes for $2.50 a gallon.
dining,Trisha Kuhlmey, the owner, said the shop sells about 900 gallons of water a day, and sales have doubled every year as the “water consciousness movement” grows. What adherents share is a wariness of tap water, particularly the fluoride added to it and the lead pipes that some of it passes through. They contend that the wrong kind of filtration removes beneficial minerals. Even traditional bottled spring water is treated with ultraviolet light or ozone gas and passed through filters to remove algae. That, they say, kills healthful bacteria — “probiotics” in raw-water parlance. The quest for pure water is hardly new; people have been drinking from natural springs and collecting rainwater from time immemorial. The crusade against adding fluoride to public water began in the 1950s among Americans who saw danger in the protective measures that had been adopted over decades to protect the populace from disease and contamination. But the off-grid water movement has become more than the fringe phenomenon it once was, with sophisticated marketing, cultural cachet, millions of dollars in funding and influential supporters from Silicon Valley. One recent morning in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., Cody Friesen, the founder and chief executive of Zero Mass Water, was inspecting water collection panels he had installed for his investor Skip Battle, a longtime tech leader who now sits on the boards of LinkedIn, Netflix and OpenTable.
dining,The system — called Source, which retails for $4,500, including installation — draws moisture from the air (the way rice does in a saltshaker) and filters it, producing about 10 liters of water a day and storing about 60 liters. The goal, Mr. Friesen said, is to make water “that’s ultra high quality and secure, totally disconnected from all infrastructure.” “Just take a breath of air,” said Mr. Friesen, a professor of materials science at Arizona State University. “Take a deep breath. No matter how wealthy or poor you are, you can take a breath and own that air that you breathe. And yet water — the government brings it to you.” Mr. Battle’s system runs on power from its own small solar panel. It feeds into a tap set up in his stone garden, where he goes to drink. He said he’s been making all his meals and drinks with it. Mr. Battle poured himself a glass. “The water from the tap just doesn’t taste quite as refreshing,” he said. “Now is that because I saw it come off the roof, and anything from the roof feels special? Maybe.” The most prominent proponent of raw water is Doug Evans, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. After his juicing company, Juicero, collapsed in September, he went on a 10-day cleanse, drinking nothing but Live Water. “I haven’t tasted tap water in a long time,” he said.
dining,Before he could order raw water on demand, Mr. Evans went “spring hunting” with friends. This has become more challenging lately: The closest spring around San Francisco has recently been cut off by landslides, so reaching it means crossing private property, which he does under cover of night. “You have to be agile and tactile, and be available to experiment,” he said. “Literally, you have to carry bottles of water through the dark.” At Burning Man, the summer festival in the Nevada desert that attracts the digerati and others, Mr. Evans and his R.V. mate brought 50 gallons of spring water they had collected. “I’m extreme about health, I know, but I’m not alone with this,” Mr. Evans said. “There are a lot of people doing this with me. You never know who you’ll run into at the spring.” The founder of Live Water, Mukhande Singh, started selling spring water from Opal Springs in Culver, Ore., three years ago, but it was a small local operation until this year. Marketing materials show Mr. Singh (né Christopher Sanborn) sitting naked and cross-legged on a hot spring, his long brown hair flowing over his chest. Pure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter, the gold standard of home water treatment, but for Mr. Singh, the goal is not pristine water, per se. “You’re going to get 99 percent of the bad stuff out,” he said. “But now you have dead water.”
dining,He said “real water” should expire after a few months. His does. “It stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,” he said. “If it sits around too long, it’ll turn green. People don’t even realize that because all their water’s dead, so they never see it turn green.” Mr. Singh believes that public water has been poisoned. “Tap water? You’re drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,” he said. “Chloramine, and on top of that they’re putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it’s a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.” (There is no scientific evidence that fluoride is a mind-control drug, but plenty to show that it aids dental health.) Talk like Mr. Singh’s disturbs Dr. Donald Hensrud, the director of the Healthy Living Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. What the raw-water partisans see as dangers, he says, are important safety measures. “Without water treatment, there’s acute and then chronic risks,” Dr. Hensrud said, including E. coli bacteria, viruses, parasites and carcinogenic compounds that can be present in untreated water. “There’s evidence all over the world of this, and the reason we don’t have those conditions is because of our very efficient water treatment.” Dr. Hensrud said he has noticed more interest in alternative water sources; a patient recently asked questions about a raw water he had been drinking. “There are people, just like with immunizations, that don’t accept the status quo,” Dr. Hensrud said.
dining,The rules for selling bottled water are imposed by states and the Food and Drug Administration, which does not specify how water be treated but sets acceptable amounts of chemicals and bacteria at a low level. State and federal inspectors make unannounced visits to bottling plants to test for harmful contaminants. Seth Pruzansky, the chief executive of Tourmaline Spring (whose website touts its “sacred living” water), got an exemption from the State of Maine in 2009 to sell his water untreated. “The natural food industry has been in the dark ages when it comes to water,” he said. “Now there is a renaissance.” The movement against tap water, like the movement against vaccines, has brought together unlikely allies from the far left and the far right. Conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, founder of the right-wing website Infowars, have long argued that fluoride was added to water to make people more docile. Similar claims can be heard in the largely liberal enclaves where Live Water is seeing interest spike. “Fluoride? It’s a deathly toxic chemical,” said Vanessa Kuemmerle of Emeryville, Calif., who does landscape design for large tech companies. She said she was an early adopter of raw water, and has noticed many of her clients following suit. “They’re health-conscious people that understand the bigger picture of what’s going on,” she said. “Everyone’s looking for an edge: nootropics, Bulletproof coffee, better water.” The health benefits she reported include better skin and the need to drink less water. “My skin’s plumper,” she said. “And I feel like I’m getting better nutrition from the food I eat.”
dining,In the community of tap-water skeptics, many talk about water the way others might about fine wine. “My friends who drink spring water, when they come over now they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, give me the good stuff,’” said Amanda Thompson, a writer in San Francisco. “The consciousness around water is changing.” Not everyone has been receptive. Many San Franciscans are proud of their tap water, which comes from Hetch Hetchy, a reservoir in Yosemite National Park. “My landlord lives across the street and thinks I’m crazy,” Ms. Thompson said. “He gave me a big rant around Hetch Hetchy water and how the water’s so good. I always hope he’s not around when there’s a delivery.” Raw water is such a nascent business that there’s debate over what exactly to call the liquid. Daniel Vitalis hosts a podcast, “ReWild Yourself,” that promotes hunting for food and gathering water; he started the site called FindASpring.com to help people locate springs. He prefers the term “unprocessed water,” which echoes the idea of processed versus unprocessed food. “I don’t like ‘raw water’ because it sort of makes people think of raw sewage,” Mr. Vitalis said. “When you say ‘live water,’ that’s going to trigger a lot of people who are into physics and biology.

technology,What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology’s Tsunami - The New York Times
sports/baseball,Tim Tebow Is a Hit With the Fans and Hitless on the Field - The New York Times SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The player came to home plate, bat in hand, and was greeted by the opposing catcher, Nick Ciuffo, who is acquainted with most of his opponents in the Arizona Fall League from a youth spent on baseball diamonds. This hitter, though, Ciuffo knew only by reputation. So as Tim Tebow was getting comfortable in the batter’s box, Ciuffo introduced himself. “I can’t really like you because I’m a big South Carolina fan,” Ciuffo said he told Tebow, who laughed and responded, “Well, nobody’s perfect.” The scene, from a game on Thursday between the Peoria Javelinas and the Scottsdale Scorpions, was a postcard-perfect tableau of Tebow’s opening week here. Two months ago, Ciuffo, a former first-round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Rays, did not know that Tebow, the former Heisman Trophy-winner from Florida and a former N.F.L. quarterback, even played baseball. Yet here Tebow was, competing with and against a group of top-level prospects, like Ciuffo, in an advanced league that is often a steppingstone to a career in the majors. One of Tebow’s Scorpions teammates is Greg Bird, a first baseman who hit 11 home runs for the Yankees as a rookie in 2015 before missing all of this year following shoulder surgery. Another teammate, and a fellow member of the Mets’ organization, is Gavin Cecchini, who made his major league debut in September after a late-season call-up from Class AAA; Cecchini doubled twice in one of the few games he played in the majors.
sports/baseball,The 29-year-old Tebow, meanwhile, last played baseball as a junior in high school in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., in 2005. It is a daunting task to try to knock off 11 years of cobwebs and the cover of the baseball against pitchers like Thursday’s Peoria starter, Kyle McGrath, who had a cup of tea at Class AAA this season, pitching one and two-thirds innings for San Diego’s team in El Paso. Not surprisingly, in his first week here, Tebow sometimes looked outclassed. He went hitless in 11 plate appearances in his first three games, recording six groundouts, three strikeouts and two walks against the highest quality pitching he has faced by far in his new baseball adventure. On the flip side, he has already demonstrated a good eye, chasing few bad pitches. “I totally get that it’s a process,” Tebow said. And whether he is polished on the diamond seems not to matter to the fans who show up in their Jets replica No. 15 Tebow jerseys or their Denver Broncos replica No. 15 jerseys or their Florida replica No. 15 jerseys. Daniel Kelly, a one-time Jets scout who left football to become a debt counselor and a minister in Arizona, showed up at Tebow’s Arizona Fall League debut at Camelback Ranch Stadium on Tuesday night in a No. 15 pinstriped Mets jersey. It was a gift from his wife, Samantha, who paid extra for express delivery last week from Florida so that Hurricane Matthew would not prevent the shirt from arriving in time for the game.
sports/baseball,The day after his debut, Tebow played his first home game at Scottsdale Stadium in front of nearly 1,800 fans, which was well above last year’s average of 500 for Scorpions games. At home or on the road this past week, the fans were like the tides: When Tebow was preparing to hit, they spilled down from their seats in the shade to vantage points near the on-deck circle, where they snapped selfies with Tebow in the background or trained their lenses on him. After his at-bat they retreated, to get out of the mid-90s heat. Tebow is excellent for business, but is baseball excellent for him? His fall league manager has kept an open mind. “I want to look at it with clear eyes,” said Tom Goodwin, the Mets’ first-base coach during the major league season. During his 14-year playing career, Goodwin was a teammate of Barry Bonds for one season in San Francisco, which proved great preparation for presiding over the Tebow media show. It’s a show that generates inevitable cynicism from others — that this is all a publicity stunt or simply an effort by the Mets to build up credit with Tebow’s agent, who also represents the All-Star outfielder Yoenis Cespedes. Cespedes can opt out of his current contract after the World Series and the Mets, perhaps with the help of his agent, are hoping they can convince him to stick around.
sports/baseball,Goodwin, however, maintained that Tebow is on the Scorpions for the same reason as his teammates: to improve as a player. He may have a lot to learn on the field, Goodwin added, but Tebow also has leadership skills, a factor that Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson cited when the team signed Tebow for $100,000 last month. Those attributes were on display Tuesday, when after going 0 for 3 at the plate in his first game and crashing face-first into the left-field wall while chasing a fly ball, Tebow comforted a fan who had collapsed in convulsions and stayed with him until his seizures subsided and the paramedics arrived. Noticing that the fan was wearing a Batman T-shirt, Tebow asked him if he liked the comic book character. “I was just trying to find something that he’d relate to,” Tebow said later. Tebow ended up spending more than 15 minutes talking to the man about a wide range of topics, from fly fishing in North Carolina to football in the Southeastern Conference. The rest of the Scorpions waited on the team bus. “He was a little late for the bus,” center fielder Champ Stuart said. “But he had a great excuse.” Tebow, who is also continuing his stint as a weekend college football analyst while he plays in the fall league, is aware his every move, his every good Samaritan act, is scrutinized for ulterior motives.
sports/baseball,“It’s not something I can control, so I really don’t spend time worrying about it,” he said, adding: “When you stand for something, or you try to, you’re going to be criticized. And that’s part of the world.” Tebow said he does not pay attention to what is being said or written about him, or at least tries not to. “They tell you to let it go in one ear and out the other,” he said. “I try not to let it even get to an ear.” But he is open to what his younger teammates have to say, and they have already said a lot. Scorpions catcher Taylor Ward, a Los Angeles Angels prospect, joked that Tebow’s glove looked so dated that he would not be surprised if it was the one he used in high school 11 years ago (it is not). Ward also took a playful swipe at Tebow’s uniform pants, which are hemmed so they fall to the tops of his shoes. “Definitely, I would have his pants over his cleats,” Ward said with a laugh, adding, “Just kind of have to talk to him a bit because baseball players have to have that swag.” Every time Tebow batted in his first three games, players with conspicuously longer baseball résumés than his leaned on or over the railing of the opponent’s dugout to watch. From his catcher’s crouch on Thursday, Ciuffo had the best vantage point.
sports/baseball,After their initial exchange, Ciuffo and Tebow kept up their banter. During one plate appearance that day, Tebow complimented Ciuffo on a throw he had made. Ciuffo said he replied, “Now if I could figure out the offense part.” Tebow told him he would be fine. In Ciuffo’s next at-bat, he tripled. When Tebow later came to the plate for another at-bat, he grinned at Ciuffo and said, “Man, I should be your coach.” Ciuffo beamed as he told the story. “It’s really cool to see him out here,” he said. “I think everybody deserves a chance. If he’s good enough, put him in the big leagues. If he’s not, he’s not.”
movies,Auditing Ape School - The New York Times We started with the breathing: low, deep, yogalike. Our eyes closed, our bellies unflexed. I was at a studio in New Orleans, sitting alongside Judy Greer (below) and Toby Kebbell, who were learning to move like primates for their roles in “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.” Terry Notary, an actor, movement coach and de facto ape expert, was leading the way. “Think of a helium balloon on a string,” he said, as we leaned forward. “We’re not using any muscles; we’re just undoing tension.” The secret to being apelike, Mr. Notary said, is to disengage your brain. “We’re just sort of undoing the social conditioning that we’re subject to as humans and becoming the animals that we really are.” It has its perks: “You see everything all at once,” he said of our heightened primate senses. “If anything moves in the room, you will feel it.” Was that the back wall I could suddenly glimpse with my gaze still forward? Or was that merely an exaggerated jolt of my own ridiculousness, as I moved around on all fours, my arms clamped into metal extenders? “My trick,” Mr. Kebbell said, demonstrating a turned-out stance, “is to remind myself I have a thumb on my foot.” Ms. Greer settled into her chimp squat. “It’s a workout,” she said, and a lesson in humility. “I used to think everyone should be a waitress or a waiter for at least a month of their lives, and now I feel like everyone should go to chimp school.”
nyregion,Gone With the Wind, a Puerto Rican Dream - The New York Times There really ought to be a law about playing “En Mi Viejo San Juan” these days. Even in the best of times, the song’s melancholy lyrics about a native son longing to return to Puerto Rico before dying is guaranteed to make listeners cry. This season — with tens of thousands forced to flee the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria — the tear-jerker takes on a special meaning as a new generation of reluctant migrants is forced to find shelter with relatives in New York, Florida and elsewhere. Rosa Iris Vega can relate. She spent decades working as a letter carrier in Harlem, raising two children as a single mother fleeing a violently abusive husband. She worked so hard in the summer that her daughter still remembers how steam rose from her skin when she took a shower at the end of the day. Yet she achieved her dream, despite a bout with breast cancer, retiring in 2013 to her childhood home in Caguas with her second husband, whom she met on the job. At her 68th birthday party last week, she was reduced to tears as a trio serenaded her with some of the old standards. This was not in Puerto Rico, but the Bronx, where she was now living with her daughter, Yadhira Gonzalez-Taylor, in a tidy house on a quiet street not far from Co-Op City. This was not how it was supposed to be.
nyregion,“My dream came true,” she said, curled up on the couch beside her husband, Nestor Lopez. “But Maria destroyed it. She took away the dream I had built for my old age. I thought we would be there until the day I died. But we were only there for five years. I had wanted to be buried there next to my parents. Now it’s the only thing I’ll be able to do.” Millions of Puerto Ricans have gone north over the decades in search of better lives for themselves and their children, working as seamstresses, janitors, doormen or — if they were lucky — owning a bodega. The plan for many of them was always to save enough money here so they could retire to the verdant island of dim childhood memory. The old songs sustained them in what they hoped would be a temporary detour. Now those tunes can be a painful reminder of Maria’s cruelty. But they can also be a gift, reminding them of the intense love that beats in the hearts of sons and daughters in exile. Ms. Vega’s daughter, Yadhira Gonzalez-Taylor, knew that, which is why a few weeks ago she reached out to Elena Marrero, a retired teacher and photographer known as Mamarazzi, for help in finding a trio of musicians to mark her mother’s birthday.
nyregion,Ms. Gonzalez-Taylor, a lawyer for the city’s Education Department, had tried to get her mother to move in with her before Maria, but she refused, even though she was weakened by the aggressive return of her cancer. Ms. Vega and her husband rode out the storm in their home, scurrying from room to room as the storm uprooted trees, tore roofs off other houses and left the tile floor dangerously slick from rain that had seeped inside. The aftermath proved worse. With no water or power, the heat started to get to her. Finally, her daughter managed to get her on a cruise ship headed north, thanks to a foundation that her husband, a firefighter in New York, knew was offering help. Ensconced in the Bronx, she started treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering, where doctors also found a dangerous cardiac condition her doctors in Puerto Rico had overlooked. “I am convinced she would have died if she had stayed in Puerto Rico,” her daughter said. “She got more care in two months at Sloan than in two years in Puerto Rico.” Granted, Ms. Vega’s cancer and its treatment have weakened her, leaving her winded after walking the few steps from the kitchen to the living room. Ms. Gonzalez-Taylor, aware of what the coming year may bring, decided she had to do something special for her. She and her brother, Hector Gonzalez, invited a group of friends and relatives to her house for a birthday party, which had to be postponed a few days after her mother was hospitalized for fluid in her lungs.
nyregion,As people milled about the living room, the trio, Los Autenticos, assembled outside the house. On cue, they strode through the door singing traditional Puerto Rican Christmas songs. Ms. Vega clutched her hands to her chest and started crying. The group stood proudly before their special audience, telling her to ask for anything she wanted. Through tears and smiles, she had been transported. “They took me back 50 years,” she said the morning after. “In that moment last night, I was not here. I was in mi barrio. Every song they sang, I could see in my mind the original artists who played them.” And she saw a glimpse of a tradition she had upheld every year since her retirement, when a roving band of musicians and neighbors crammed into her house for a movable feast of music, food and drink known as a parranda. “At least I had a bit of that last night,” she said. “This Christmas, with such sad memories I can say I had my parranda. And here I am. When God wishes, I am at his will, I hope he lets me live a little more. If not, well, everyone who has gone to the other side has never come back. That must mean they are happy where they have gone.”
us,Measles Cases Linked to Disneyland Rise, and Debate Over Vaccinations Intensifies - The New York Times LOS ANGELES — A measles outbreak that began at Disneyland is spreading across California and beyond, prompting health officials to move aggressively to contain it — including by barring unvaccinated students from going to school in Orange County. The outbreak has increased concerns that a longstanding movement against childhood vaccinations has created a surge in a disease that was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Health officials said 59 cases of measles had been diagnosed in California as of Wednesday, with an additional eight related cases spread through Utah, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Mexico. Among those infected are five workers at Disneyland, where the outbreak was spotted in mid-December; 42 of the 59 California cases have been linked to the Disneyland outbreak. The cases were a continuation of what health officials said was a worrisome increase in measles in Orange County and other places where parents had resisted the urging of health professionals to inoculate their children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 644 cases of measles from 27 states last year, by far the largest number since 2000. Before measles vaccines became commonplace in 1963, about three million to four million Americans a year contracted the disease, the agency said, and 400 to 500 died from it. The latest outbreak has renewed a heated debate about an anti-vaccination movement championed largely by parents who believe discredited research linking vaccines to autism, or who believe that the risks of some vaccines, including the measles inoculations, outweigh any potential benefit.
us,“We can expect to see many more cases of this preventable disease unless people take measures to prevent it,” said Dr. Gilberto F. Chávez, the deputy director of the California Center for Infectious Diseases. “I am asking unvaccinated Californians to consider getting vaccinated against measles.” Dr. James Cherry, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the outbreak was “100 percent connected” to the anti-immunization campaign. “It wouldn’t have happened otherwise — it wouldn’t have gone anywhere,” he said. “There are some pretty dumb people out there.” Health officials in Orange County issued a letter to parents saying that students who could not prove they had received a measles shot could be barred from class; more than 20 were sent home from an Orange County high school this week. “The majority of the cases that we are seeing here are underimmunized,” said Dr. Eric G. Handler, the public health officer for Orange County, referring to children who had not been vaccinated or had received only one of the two necessary shots. “This is a serious contagious disease that is preventable. The message is absolutely critical that if you are not vaccinated, you need to get vaccinated.” The vaccination exemption rate among kindergarten students in California — cases in which parents said they did not want their children vaccinated for health, religious or other reasons — was 3.1 percent in the 2013-14 school year, according to the C.D.C. report. Oregon had an exemption rate of 7.1 percent, the nation’s highest, the report found. Health officials said the vaccination rate needed to be above 95 percent in all communities to prevent outbreaks.
us,Still, the California figure can be deceiving. Health officials said there were pockets across the state, including wealthy neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Orange Counties and enclaves in Northern California, where the exemption rate jumped into the double digits. California has long been viewed as particularly prone to this kind of outbreak because of its population size and the number of people arriving from overseas. “The problem is that there are these pockets with low vaccination rates,” said Dr. Jane Seward, the deputy director of the viral diseases division at the C.D.C. “If a case comes into a population where a lot of people are unvaccinated, that’s where you get the outbreak and where you get the spread.” Organizations that have led the campaign of doubts about vaccinations suggested that it was too soon to draw such a conclusion. The groups cautioned parents not to be pressured into having their children receive vaccinations, which the organizations say have been linked to other diseases. Health professionals say those claims are unfounded or vastly overstated. “It’s premature to blame the increase in reports of measles on the unvaccinated when we don’t have all the facts yet,” said Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group raising concerns about inoculations. “I do know this: Fifty-seven cases of measles coming out of Disneyland in a country with a population of 317 million people is not a lot of cases. We should all take a deep breath and wait to see and get more information.”
us,A handful of doctors seem sympathetic to these views. Dr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica pediatrician who has cautioned against the way vaccines are used, said he had “given more measles vaccines” than ever before but did not like giving the shot to younger children. “I think whatever risk there is — and I can’t prove a risk — is, I think, caused by the timing,” he said, referring to when the shot is administered. “It’s given at a time when kids are more susceptible to environmental impact. Don’t get me wrong; I have no proof that this vaccine causes harm. I just have anecdotal reports from parents who are convinced that their children were harmed by the vaccine.” The battle has moved to state legislatures, where lawmakers have sought to make it easier for parents to obtain exemptions from vaccination requirements. However, all 31 bills introduced from 2009 to 2012 that would have loosened the exemption process were defeated, said Saad B. Omer, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University who studies vaccine refusal. Three out of five bills that sought to tighten the requirement passed, he said. California tightened its “personal belief” exemption law last year, requiring parents to submit a form signed by a health care provider. But Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, added a religious exemption at the last minute; parents who choose that option do not need a doctor’s signature.
sports/baseball,Baseball Playoffs: What if Three Teams Tie for Two Wild-Card Spots? - The New York Times None of the six divisional races in baseball were close this year. But the wild-card races look to be going right down to the wire. The close battles raise the possibility that 162 games will not be enough to separate the teams and that a tiebreaker will be needed for the first time since 2013. The race in the National League is so close that it might produce something never before seen in Major League Baseball: a three-way playoff. Should only two teams be tied for the last wild-card spot when the season ends Sunday, the resolution is fairly straightforward. They would play a single game, which would be considered the 163rd of the regular season, on Monday night, with the home team determined by the head-to-head record of the two teams. Such a situation last occurred when the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Texas Rangers in 2013 for the right to face the American League’s other wild-card team, the Cleveland Indians, in the playoffs. There have been 14 tiebreaker playoffs in baseball, beginning in 1946 when the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in what was then a best-of-three series to take the National League pennant. The Toronto Blue Jays beat Baltimore, 5-1, on Tuesday and opened a two-game lead over the Orioles for the first wild-card spot in the American League. The Orioles still have a one-game edge for the second spot.
sports/baseball,The N.L. race is more volatile. The Mets routed Miami, 12-1, on Tuesday to maintain at least a half-game advantage over the San Francisco Giants, who played later, for the top wild-card spot. The St. Louis Cardinals entered Tuesday a game behind the Giants. Although a long shot, a three-way tie for the two wild-card spots is possible. You may have noticed that three is an odd number, making a fair playoff rather difficult. If it happens, it will work like this. To start, the teams will have to be ranked. The first criterion is head-to-head record. This falls in favor of the Mets and the Cardinals, who each hold a 4-3 record against the Giants, so they would play first, probably Monday. The winner would make the playoffs, but the loser would get another chance and play the Giants in San Francisco, probably Tuesday, in a win-or-go-home game. The winners of the two games would then meet Wednesday in the real wild-card game. There are a couple of complications, even if this playoff is needed. The host of a Mets-Cardinals game is still to be determined because the teams have gone 3-3 against each other. The next tiebreaker is divisional record, so the last few regular-season games will determine which team ranks higher. For the record, the top-ranked team actually has a choice of whether it plays in the Monday game or waits until Tuesday. But no team is likely to choose one chance at the playoffs, as the Giants would get, rather than two.
sports/baseball,The traveling complications might be as tangled as the playoff rules. In theory, the Mets could play four games in three cities in four nights: Sunday at Philadelphia (regular season), Monday at St. Louis and Tuesday at San Francisco (tiebreaker games), and Wednesday at St. Louis (wild-card game). And the prize, should the Mets get through this gantlet? A series against the juggernaut Chicago Cubs.
world/middleeast,In Syria, Rebels Threaten Kurdish-Controlled Territory as U.S. Allies Clash - The New York Times BEIRUT, Lebanon — In a new escalation that further complicates American involvement in the Syrian war, Syrian rebels pressed deeper into the northern part of the country on Sunday, seizing territory with the aid of Turkish airstrikes. The rebels, with Turkey’s help, took the border town of Jarabulus last week from the Islamic State — an incursion supported by the United States. But the rebels are now advancing into territory controlled by Syrian Kurds. That means the new fighting pits two American-backed Syrian forces against each other: rebel groups aided by the C.I.A. and allied intelligence agencies, and Kurdish-led militias that work with the Pentagon under an umbrella group called the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F. The United States has considered the Kurdish-led militias its most reliable partner on the ground in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. The United States has in recent days appeared to rebalance its support for the Kurdish militias with its backing of the Syrian rebels and Turkey, a NATO ally. The Turks consider the Syrian Kurdish militias their enemy and are intent on keeping them from taking over an unbroken stretch of land along the border. As part of that rebalancing, the United States warned the Kurds last week that they should return to the eastern side of the Euphrates River, essentially asking them to cede control of areas they had seized recently from Islamic State fighters.
world/middleeast,But it is unclear what the United States will do if its allies continue to fight each other. Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, wrote in an email on Sunday: “While we are closely monitoring reports of clashes south of Jarabulus — where ISIL is no longer located — between the Turkish armed forces, some opposition groups and units that are affiliated with the S.D.F., we want to make clear that we find these clashes unacceptable.” He added: “This is an already crowded battle space. Accordingly, we are calling on all armed actors to stand down immediately and take appropriate measures to deconflict.” The offensive on Sunday was on the western side of the Euphrates, including in the villages of Jib al-Kousa and Amarna, where the airstrikes hit. The Kurdish-led militias said that they had left the area, but that groups aligned with them remained in charge. The Syrian rebels, however, said the Kurdish militias had not left and had started the fight by attacking a Turkish tank. Amarna and Jib al-Kousa fell to the rebels, according to a Turkish statement. It added that 10 villages had been taken from Kurdish control and four from the Islamic State. It was not the first time the American-backed groups had clashed — they have bitter differences over the possibility of Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria — but their battles could be the most consequential yet, occurring at a volatile time in the multisided five-year conflict.
world/middleeast,The most powerful Syrian Kurdish party is reeling from what its supporters see as an American betrayal after the United States gave the green light for Turkey to send tanks and allied rebels into Syria last week. Turkey sees a chance to curb the growing power of the Syrian Kurdish party, which it says is indistinguishable from the P.K.K., a Kurdish insurgent group that Turkey is battling at home and considers a terrorist organization. But Turkey is also in the midst of a delicate partial rapprochement with the Syrian government’s main ally, Russia, which is watching to see how far Turkey will go in backing the rebels trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. All of that is happening as Russia and the United States seek, without success so far, to lay out parameters for joint military action against extremist groups, including the Islamic State, and a road map to a political transition in Syria in a bid to end the war. As the battleground in northern Syria became increasingly confused, it was unclear what was happening to the civilians caught in the crossfire. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, and Kurdish local news outlets declared that 35 civilians had been killed in the two villages hit by Turkish airstrikes. The Turkish government said it had killed 25 Kurdish “terrorists.”
world/middleeast,It was also unclear where the weekend offensive would stop. Some rebels threatened to advance to Manbij, a town recently recaptured from the Islamic State by the Kurdish-led forces with the help of intensive American airstrikes. The Kurds say that they have left the town, which is west of the Euphrates and is mainly Arab, but that they have handed the area to a local military council made up of their allies. Some Syrian rebels interviewed by telephone said they were determined to take back what they considered Arab land from the Kurdish-led forces, who have captured a long stretch of the border. The Kurdish-held territory is separated by an area still under Islamic State control. But others said they wanted to fight only the Islamic State and the Syrian government, not Syrian Kurds. One of those rebels, Ahmad Kanjo, a commander, said he had been forced to act because his fighters had come under attack by Kurdish-led forces. “We weren’t planning to open a front with them,” he said, but added that an attack from Kurdish forces had hit a Turkish tank — Turkey confirmed that one soldier had been killed — and had killed three of his men. “We are lost,” he said in a telephone interview. “My enemy was supposed to be Daesh” — an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State — “and the regime, but the Kurds are attacking me from the back.” “I don’t know who is bombing whom,” he said.
nyregion/thecity,Come for the Train, Linger for the Music - The New York Times WHAT is it about subway music? Why is it so compelling, so intimate and potent? Why does it reach us in a way that street music doesn’t? And why does it interest us so endlessly? It seems there’s no limit to our fascination. Part of its power, I think, lies in the setting. We’ve left the air and light and freedom of the street, descending into the darkness of the underground. It’s a more mysterious place, more complicated. The subway is both suffocating and liberating. We hurtle through the darkness, locked beside strangers, breathing their air. We watch each other like hawks, though we pretend not to see each other, even if one of us is six inches away and singing at the top of his lungs. For the subway is also concert hall; musicians flock there, drawn by the acoustics and the captive audiences. The music echoes against the stone and in our souls. The music plays in the subterranean reaches of ourselves. We can’t ignore it. I live on the No. 6 line, near the Hunter College station. This season,  three men in their 50s have been singing there, in black jackets and berets. They have a keyboard and a rattle for backup, and they sing close harmony: Aaron Neville, Motown. The lead singer has a cherubic face, sunglasses and a big grin. They all have sweet voices, strong and mellow against the stone walls.
nyregion/thecity,“Since you’ve been gone,” they sing. They snap their fingers. “Could it be I’m falling in love?” On the fast songs they clap, smiling at us. When the train arrives and we get on, they’re still smiling as the doors close. We smile back: How can we not? They’ve made a silver space for us with those bright, sweet voices. As the train pulls away, the lead singer waves; we wave back. We don’t love everyone, though. At 14th Street is a young guy, down on the platform between the express and the local. He sits on one plastic bucket and uses his drumsticks on three others. Fast and dexterous, he gets into a long, complicated, rising crescendo, drumming on the buckets, the metal trash can, the pavement. He’s dazzling, he’s brilliant. We don’t care. He’s too loud. Everyone hears him, but no one looks at him. We walk past frowning, as though we’ve just remembered we left the stove on. SOMETIMES at 68th Street there’s a dignified middle-aged man, red sweater, brush cut. He has a deep, full, classical voice, and beautiful posture. He sings “Ave Maria” to an electronic orchestra. We listen respectfully. Some of us put money in his violin case. When the train pulls in, it drowns him out, but he keeps singing. We can see that this is a matter of principle, respect for the music. We can’t hear him, but we can see his throat pulsing, the veins in his forehead. As the train pulls away, he’s still singing, hands outstretched, Latin words pouring out soundlessly.
nyregion/thecity,It’s hard to hold a crowd on the platform. We’re a captive audience, but only until the train arrives. The mezzanine floor at 14th Street is a better venue because we don’t see the train we’re about to miss, and we might linger to listen. Late one afternoon, there are five guys there, in their early 40s: the Tin Pan Blues Band. They’re playing lively, funky jazz on banjo, clarinet, trumpet, saxophone, bass and a silver guitar. The trumpet player sits on a chair in the middle. He has a roundish face, a short, nondescript beard and glasses. They all look like this: friendly, a bit dorky. The clarinetist wears an ochre sweater with red diamonds across the chest. The trumpeter lowers his horn and begins to sing “St. Louis Woman.” He has a strong, bluesy voice, not beautiful, but full of heart. We all feel it. The bass thumps. The crowd thickens. The singer cries, “I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate.” We all wish we could, too. In an open space, two couples are dancing. A girl with long blond hair, a red sash around her hips, bell-bottom jeans. Her partner is a young guy, with a brown blazer and a soft cap. The other girl, with long hair and bangs, wears a black dress and neon pink tights. Her partner’s in a black blazer and a black hat with a red feather. They’re dipping and twirling, spinning and sliding. We’re rapt. There are about 40 of us. It’s nearly 5 o’clock, and we need to get home. We can’t move.
nyregion/thecity,The singer belts out “Bill Bailey.” The man beside me says, “No mike, right? He must be exhausted!” He’s right, there is no mike. It’s just us and them. A young mother holds her crying daughter  in her arms, swaying to the music. Her daughter turns quiet. The singer picks up his horn and puts in a mute. The dancers switch partners. The woman beside me says, in a thick Jamaican accent: “I love this music! I love the dancing! I love it!” People coming up the stairs find themselves suddenly center stage, in the middle of a concert. Hurrying past, they turn to look. Some of them quickly throw bills into the open case. The singer lowers his trumpet and leans back against the wall, belting out another song, eyes shut, heart open. It’s long after 5 when I finally tear myself away. They’re still singing. I go downstairs, still listening, and get on the wrong train. By the time I realize it, I’m on the wrong side of town. I get off the subway and go up to stand in the dark, waiting for the crosstown bus. It’s worth it. Subway music takes you where you want to go. The train is extra.
us,Greenpeace Activists Dangle From Oregon Bridge for 2nd Day to Protest Arctic Drilling - The New York Times Activists who have spent more than 24 hours dangling from an Oregon bridge to protest Shell’s plans to drill in the Arctic vowed to sustain their human barricade, after they joined kayakers in the water below to block an icebreaking ship from leaving Portland. Some of the 13 activists from Greenpeace are providing live updates from their swaying bivouacs beneath the St. Johns Bridge, where they unfurled banners and stayed roped together to form a blockade as helpers on the bridge lowered supplies in sacks. According to the Greenpeace blog, the icebreaker Fennica leased by Shell was prevented on Wednesday from joining the rest of the drilling fleet in the Arctic. Unless it does so, the company will be unable to proceed with drilling in the Chukchi Sea. The vessel is carrying a piece of equipment that is used to cap an oil well in the event of a blowout. A Shell spokesman, Curtis Smith, told The Associated Press: “As for the activities of the day, we respect the choice that anyone might make to protest based on Shell’s Arctic aspirations; we just ask that they do so safely and within the boundaries of the law.” On Thursday morning, the icebreaker started moving toward the bridge, with Coast Guard vessels nearby, and then retreated. The activists cleared out of the way for a barge, unrelated to the protest, to pass through.
us,The protest could become costly. On Thursday, a federal judge in Alaska ordered Greenpeace to pay an hourly fine starting at 11 a.m. Pacific time that would increase as the protest continues. The fine on Thursday is $2,500 an hour, and would rise by $2,500 each day until maxing out at $10,000 an hour from Sunday onward. The protest against Shell’s Arctic drilling plans in Portland follows another in Washington State, where protesters, some in kayaks, helped muster public pressure to seek a delay of the mooring of Shell’s rigs. It is not clear how long the activists can sustain their midair protest site over the Willamette River. Kayakers have been working in shifts, Daphne Wysham, a member of the group, told The Oregonian. The executive director of Greenpeace USA, Annie Leonard, said in an interview at the start of the protest that the bridge danglers and the kayakers were a “line of defense.” “And these activists, in the air and on water, are right now the last thing that stands between Shell Oil and its absolutely pathological plans to drill for oil in the Arctic this summer,” she said in an interview with Democracy Now! A spokesman for the local sheriff’s office, Lt. Steve Alexander, said on Wednesday in The Oregonian that the authorities were there in case anyone fell from the bridge and to keep the river navigable. Videos posted by Greenpeace USA show sacks of supplies being lowered to the dangling activists.
us,On a Reddit forum, the activists described some of the conditions, such as how they prepared for the heat of 100 degrees Fahrenheit: with long-sleeve shirts, sunscreen, shade and water. They are also posting images and updates on Twitter from the protest via #ShellNo of the view from their suspended sites.
world/africa,Burkina Faso Police Join Revolt - The New York Times DAKAR, Senegal — Police officers in Burkina Faso joined a growing wave of popular unrest on Thursday, firing their weapons in the air and shooting tear gas as discontent over high prices, low wages and the 24-year-rule of President Blaise Compaoré spread in the landlocked West African nation. Officers poured into the streets in the central district of the capital, Ouagadougou, on Thursday morning, according to a local journalist, Paul Miki Rouamba, who witnessed the scene. He said they had fired off shots around the central police station and roared through the capital on motorcycles to express their discontent over low salaries and some of the force’s commanders. The police in other cities of the impoverished, Colorado-size nation of 16 million also fired into the air in a show of anger at economic conditions, according to news organizations in Burkina Faso, including in the country’s second largest city, Bobo-Dioulasso. The day before, merchants in the city of Koudougou burned down several buildings associated with the local government to protest a crackdown on unpaid rent in the municipal market. The police are the latest group to exhibit frustration in Burkina Faso, joining students, soldiers and merchants in the tightly controlled, one-party state run by Mr. Compaoré ever since a coup d’état that saw the demise of his former army comrade, in the late 1980s.
world/africa,Mr. Compaoré was re-elected with over 80 percent of the vote last fall, amid opposition complaints of an unfair election, and his rule has mostly gone unchallenged in a country where 80 percent of the population relies on subsistence agriculture and three quarters are illiterate. That dynamic, analysts suggest — low educational levels in one of the world’s poorest countries — makes a North African-style revolt against a long-ruling autocrat unlikely. But with the political crisis this year in a neighboring state, Ivory Coast, on which Burkina Faso is economically dependent — thousands migrate there for work, and most goods pass through the port in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s main city — the country’s economy has suffered and social discontent has mushroomed. In February, students demonstrated after the death of a colleague in police custody, and five were killed. In April, soldiers rioted in the capital, looting businesses, hotels and the homes of government officials because they were unhappy over the prosecution of army comrades. Mr. Compaoré, a former army captain, dissolved his government and named the former editor of the state newspaper as prime minister. He did not, though, name any opposition figures to the new cabinet, and the unrest has continued. Analysts say there is no obvious link between the various protesting groups in the country except general discontent. “They seem to be somewhat separate strands,” said one Western expert on the country, who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize his current position. Everybody is angry at high prices, the expert said, “and almost nobody has confidence in the government. If the military stuff isn’t settled, everything else is up for grabs.”
world/africa,The opposition has called for a large-scale demonstration in the capital on Saturday.
business,Supreme Court Rules Iran Bank Must Pay for Terrorist Attacks - The New York Times WASHINGTON — Iran’s central bank must pay nearly $2 billion to victims of terrorist attacks, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday. In a 6-to-2 decision, the court said Congress had not exceeded its constitutional role in enacting a statute to make it easier for the plaintiffs to recover damages that had been awarded to them in a series of lawsuits. The cases were brought by the families of Americans killed in terrorist attacks found to have been sponsored by Iran, including relatives of those who died in the 1983 Marine Corps barracks bombing in Lebanon. That attack killed 241 servicemen. The plaintiffs sought to collect frozen funds from Bank Markazi, Iran’s central bank, relying on a 2012 federal law, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, that made the task easier by specifying assets of the bank that could satisfy the plaintiffs’ judgments. The law was quite specific, naming a single, pending consolidated case by caption and docket number. As a trial judge put it, the law “sweeps away” any “federal or state law impediments that might otherwise exist” to letting the plaintiffs obtain the money. The bank responded that the law violated the Constitution because it was focused on a single case and compelled courts “to reach a predetermined result.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rejected the argument, saying Congress has the power to alter legal standards in existing cases.
business,In dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said, “There has never been anything like” the 2012 law. “Hereafter,” he wrote, “with this court’s seal of approval, Congress can unabashedly pick the winners and losers in particular pending cases.” But Justice Ginsburg said the law was fairly routine, listing earlier ones that applied to given railroads, a single bridge, a specific settlement agreement and one oil tanker. “Congress may indeed direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases,” she wrote, adding that “a statute does not impinge on judicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts.” The 2012 law, she wrote, “provides a new standard clarifying that, if Iran owns certain assets, the victims of Iran-sponsored terrorist attacks will be permitted to execute against those assets.” “Applying laws implementing Congress’ policy judgments, with fidelity to those judgments, is commonplace for the judiciary,” Justice Ginsburg wrote. In any event, Justice Ginsburg wrote, the 2012 law still left courts with work to do, as it did not define key terms. Courts were required to sort out questions over the ownership and location of assets, she added. The decision, in Bank Markazi v. Peterson, No. 14-770, came as the United States and Iran have taken steps to ease tensions. Justice Ginsburg said the court should be wary of intruding on judgments made by Congress and the president in the conduct of foreign affairs.
business,“Congress passed, and the president signed” the 2012 law, Justice Ginsburg wrote, “in furtherance of their stance on a matter of foreign policy. Action in that realm warrants respectful review by courts.” The Obama administration supported the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court. When the case was argued in January, a lawyer for the administration drew a distinction between laws intended solely to pick a winner in a pending case and ones that changed the applicable law, even if only for a pending case. Chief Justice Roberts said that was a distinction without a difference. “You’re saying Congress has to be cute about it,” he said. Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, Samuel A. Alito Jr., and Elena Kagan joined all of Justice Ginsburg’s opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas joined most of it, but he noted without explanation that he did not accept the part of the opinion concerning the deference due the other branches in matters of foreign affairs. In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said the majority had yielded too much power to Congress. “No less than if it had passed a law saying ‘respondents win,’” the chief justice wrote, “Congress has decided this case by enacting a bespoke statute tailored to this case that resolves the parties’ specific legal disputes to guarantee respondents victory.” The 2012 law, he wrote, allowed Congress to assume a role that the Constitution had committed to the judiciary, “changing the law — for these proceedings alone — simply to guarantee that respondents win.”
business,“At issue here is a basic principle, not a technical rule,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote, one that he said, quoting a 1988 dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, may “effect important change in the equilibrium of power.”
world/middleeast,Assad Makes Unannounced Trip to Moscow to Discuss Syria With Putin - The New York Times MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, to Moscow for an unannounced visit to discuss their joint military campaign and a political transition in Syria, the Kremlin announced on Wednesday. According to a transcript posted on the Kremlin’s website, Mr. Putin met Mr. Assad late Tuesday and told him that Russia was ready to contribute not only to the fight against terrorism but also to a political settlement of the conflict that has raged for more than four years. Mr. Assad, in turn, briefed the Russian leader about the situation on the ground and on next steps. The surprise visit — evidently Mr. Assad’s first trip outside Syria since the civil war began there in 2011 — highlighted how the political and military horizon of the long war of attrition has shifted drastically because of Russia’s intervention. In the brief remarks released by the Kremlin, Mr. Putin told Mr. Assad that the military and political issues were linked. “On the question of a settlement in Syria, our position is that positive results in military operations will lay the basis for then working out a long-term settlement, based on a political process that involves all political forces, ethnic and religious groups,” Mr. Putin said. “Ultimately, it is the Syrian people alone who must have the deciding voice here.”
world/middleeast,In his response, Mr. Assad said that Russian intervention had halted the spread of terrorism and that a political transition could come after that threat was addressed. “If it were not for your actions and decisions, the terrorism that is spreading through the region now would have made even greater gains and spread to even wider territories,” Mr. Assad said, according to the Kremlin transcript. “We all know that any military action must be followed by political steps,” Mr. Assad said, calling the threat from terrorism a “real obstacle” to any political settlement. A summary of the discussion, also carried by the official Syrian news agency, said Mr. Assad had demanded that the United States and regional players like Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar halt support for his opponents. “Of course, the whole nation wants to participate in deciding the destiny of their state, not only the ruling party,” Mr. Assad said. Dmitry S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, would not comment on whether the two men broached the topic of Mr. Assad’s future during the talks, which Mr. Peskov described as “lengthy.” The most obvious focus of the talks was “the fight against terrorist and extremist groups, issues of the continuation of the Russian operation supporting the offensive of the Syrian military,” Mr. Peskov said. Just a day earlier, Turkey, one of Mr. Assad’s most implacable critics, said it would accept the Syrian leader’s staying in office for the first six months of a political transition, although the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, told reporters Wednesday that Turkey’s insistence that Mr. Assad must go had not changed.
world/middleeast,The United States and its regional allies, as well as central factions of the Syrian opposition in exile, reject the idea of a significant role for Mr. Assad in any transition. Those differences have stymied international efforts to negotiate a political settlement. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry, along with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, in Vienna on Friday for talks focused on Syria, the Russian foreign ministry announced. Aside from the obvious issues of mutual concern given the current military alliance of Russia and Syria, the meeting between Mr. Assad and Mr. Putin was another chance to emphasize Russia’s re-emergence as a crucial player in the Middle East. Part of the inspiration for Russian interference in Syria was to break out of the isolation imposed on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine. In the remarks posted on the Kremlin website, Mr. Putin highlighted the fact that he was the one who called the meeting and that Russia wanted to be involved in the military and political goals. “Despite the dramatic situation in your country, you have responded to our request and come here to Russia, and we thank you for this,” Mr. Putin said. He added, “We are ready to make our contribution not only to the military operations and the fight against terrorism, but also to the political process.” He said Russia would do this in coordination with other global powers.
world/middleeast,The lack of enthusiasm from Washington to Russia’s initiatives on Syria has been a disappointment to the Kremlin, and the meeting with Mr. Assad might put new pressure on the Obama administration to engage. Russia expressed displeasure on Tuesday that an agreement signed between the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defense earlier in the day had not gone further in forging cooperation in Syria. Mr. Assad has not made any public visits abroad since the uprising began in March 2011, with diplomats long speculating that, if he left, those around him might overthrow him. But the new Russian support, including this high-profile meeting in Moscow, has clearly given him extra clout and a new political lease on life. “He’ll return to Damascus temporarily reinforced by the Russian military and publicly expressed political support,” said a Western diplomat in the Middle East, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to the rules of his ministry. Mr. Putin has also made a habit of staking out policy positions or taking other actions that appear to contradict or at least supplant his previous statements. He was playing down the chance of military action in the days before his air force started bombing in Syria on Sept. 30. He and other Russian officials have also repeatedly said that they are not married to the idea of Mr. Assad as leader of Syria. But the meeting gave Mr. Assad a certain endorsement, and it also pointed to Russia as the crucial player in any future political transition in Syria.
world/middleeast,Analysts say they believe that Russia hopes to shore up Mr. Assad’s power over key parts of central Syria and then push the fight against Islamic State strongholds in the West. Russia and Syria tend to group the armed opposition organizations, including both the Islamic State and rebels backed by the West, as Islamic terrorists. Mr. Putin repeated his previous statements that at least 4,000 men from Russia and the former Soviet republics who have gone to Syria to fight for the Islamic State represent a real danger should they come home. That argument has fueled the popularity of the war at home. He has also sought to use Syria to burnish Russia’s credentials as a global power and his own as a central figure in solving international problems. During the visit, senior Russian officials joined Mr. Putin and Mr. Assad for dinner including the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu; the prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev; and Mr. Lavrov, the foreign minister. The Moscow meeting was the first encounter between the two presidents since Russian forces began airstrikes in Syria, and it is believed to be their first meeting since 2007. Diplomats have said previously that there was little warmth or chemistry between the two men. Although the air campaign has been publicly portrayed as an effort to turn back Islamic State militants, the main targets thus far have been the opposition units that most directly threaten Mr. Assad.
world/middleeast,Under the cover provided by about 50 Russian military aircraft, the Syrian armed forces, along with fighters from Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, have been pressing a ground offensive in and around important central cities, including Aleppo.
books,Excerpt - Driving on the Rim - By Thomas McGuane - The New York Times 1 My name is Berl Pickett, Dr. Berl Pickett. But I sign checks and documents “I. B. Pickett,” and this requires some explanation. My very forceful mother, a patriot and evangelical Christian, named me after the author of “God Bless America”; so, I am Irving Berlin Pickett and well aware of the absurdity of my name. My father wanted Lefty Frizzell Pickett. That would have been worse. In any case, my very name illustrates the borrowed nature of my life, not easily denied. In fact, I’ve learned to enjoy my circumstances as I have moved among people trapped in their homes, jobs, and families — and their names! My esteemed colleague Alan Hirsch, mountaineer and cardiologist, calls me Irving, with a chuckle. When I first arrived at our clinic from the Indian Health Service, Dr. Hirsch told me that I couldn’t call myself a physician until I had delivered babies to ambivalent parents or taught the old to accept their grotesque new faces. I don’t know about that, but I do abide in the conviction that I’ve come a long way, and lately I’ve wondered how this all happened. L. Raymond Hoxey bought an old mansion in Livingston, Montana, and converted the third floor into a delightful apartment with a view of the Absaroka Mountains. The second floor housed his print collection in archival conditions, with humidifiers and air-quality equipment. The first floor was divided into two smaller but still comfortable apartments, one of which was home to his assistant, Tessa Larionov, and the other, in summer, to a textile historian employed by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, who was also a trout fisherman.
books,The year the historian died, I was still in pre-med and painting houses to support myself; I moved into his vacated apartment. Acknowledging that there is a difference between being naive and being innocent, I will say that I was entirely naive. My parents lived a few miles away, but we weren’t getting along and I needed some distance, despite the fact that my mother was sick and often ranted about God. There are many versions of God around the world, but my mother’s was definitely a guy, and a mean one. Like many aspiring to study medicine, I planned to get rich but I wasn’t rich yet; I was just a poor house painter — out of work and looking for whatever came along — and despite all other evidence, I feared that I would be one forever, packing a great wheel of color chips from one indifferent house to another. I don’t mean to suggest mild insecurity here: by any reasonable standard, I was losing my mind.
books,Tessa Larionov was the daughter of a Russian engineer who had immigrated to the United States in 1953 and found his way to Montana, where he set up business building bridges for the railroad. His offices were in Choteau, where Tessa was born and grew up. Tessa’s mother was not Russian; her father had met her in New Jersey, where he first landed. She may have been Italian. Tessa was a powerfully built but attractive woman, with black hair, black eyes, and the look of a Tartar, wry and a little dangerous. She was liked by everyone who knew her. Trained in library science, she had worked as an archivist at some very august places, including the Huntington, in Pasadena, where she’d met her future employer and our landlord, L. Raymond Hoxey, who had let Tessa talk him into retiring to Montana to run his rare-prints business with her help. Hoxey was eighty-one years old, and his arrangement with Tessa was a means of avoiding assisted living. She was very fond of him and had wanted to go home to Montana, and so it worked for both of them. Tessa was exactly thirty, still single, though she had enjoyed an active love life, leaving in her wake only grateful hearts, or so she said. “They’re all still crazy about me,” she told me. “That’s why I left California.” Settling down was of no interest; she’d grown absorbed with the prints, and she wanted to keep her eye on Hoxey. I was twenty, but she treated me as if I were even younger — a salute to my retarded behavior.
books,My father had worked briefly as a pipe fitter for the Northern Pacific Railroad. In the course of corporate takeovers, the railroad had actually changed its name several times, but Northern Pacific was the one that stuck in all our minds. It meant something. Burlington Northern meant nothing. Then he had a little stock farm he liked to call a ranch, whose main purpose was to let him keep horses. But he lost it to the bank and went to work for the post office. My mother was a hairdresser and, because of her big mouth and religious mania, had enemies all over southwestern Montana and very few customers. During my childhood, they had had a traveling rug-cleaning business, and the three of us saw most of the West as we towed the steamer behind our van, an oldfashioned Steam Jenny with an oil-filled crankcase and a picture of a Vargas-type girl in black nylons emblazoned on its side — wonderful years, really. As an only child, I was all but homeschooled, then run back and forth between our house and the less fashionable of the two grade schools, before going to the local high school, where I was anonymous, never having been allowed by my overprotective mother to learn a sport. My mother joined one Pentecostal church after another, followed by my father, whose skepticism had long ago evaporated in the heat of her enthusiasm; they stopped just short of snake handling. But I liked to fish; I’d fish wherever there was water, and I fished in a lot of ditches where there was no hope of success. I now understand that I was for my age a weirdly underdeveloped human being, ripe for the sort of encounter I had with Tessa Larionov. Even my mother noticed my immaturity; she was always telling me, “Stop staring at people!” But she had once given me a gift beyond price: looking down at me when I was a little boy, she said, “You’re an old soul. You’ve been here before.”
books,It was Hoxey whom I got to know first. The day I arranged to rent from him, he happened to have received several Reginald Marsh prints, of which he was very proud and which he wanted me to see. I acted like I’d heard of Reginald Marsh. I didn’t know one painter from another, but I had a hunger for this sort of information; I felt it would be useful later, when I was rich. Hoxey was a pleasant old man who must have once been very fat, because he had loose flesh hanging from him everywhere and as many as seven chins. I always tried to count them while he was speaking to me, but then something in his remarks would break my concentration. This physicality, which bespoke a lifetime of phlegmatic living, gave his discourse on prints the authority of a weathered desert rat holding forth on cactus. I remember him carefully unpacking one of the prints — a kind of crazy thing with blank-faced people swarming in and out of doorways, none of them reacting to anyone else. Hoxey said that it was the calmest Reginald Marsh he’d ever seen. “No ‘Moonlight and Pretzels’ in this one!” he cried. I could see both that he’d be an agreeable landlord and that many health issues lay before him. As someone aspiring to be a doctor, I could make a little game of guessing which one would kill him.
books,Tessa asked me over one night for drinks. She had done a beautiful job of making her apartment habitable, with comfortable old furniture that she’d bought cheap and upholstered. She also had a good many of Hoxey’s prints on loan, though, as she explained, she was really just storing them, and her collection changed as things were sold from Hoxey’s inventory. She made a little face when she told me that she couldn’t afford to get attached to any of the prints, quite a trial for her, as she loved the art of all nations. Cocktails and art, I thought; maybe I’ll get into her pants. I’m sure that at the time I had a big goober smile on my face as I contemplated such an outcome. Tessa said I reminded her of Li’l Abner. “Because I work upstairs, I’ve had to become a walker just to get outside,” she said, making our drinks in a blender. “You start getting curious about different neighborhoods — where the railroaders lived, where the ranchers retired, where the doctors and bankers lived. In the winter, when the wind is up, I have to tie a scarf over my face. Anybody you see in the street is ducking for a building, kind of like in the Blitz.”
books,As I waited for my drink, I found myself leaning forward in my chair with my hands pressed between my knees. It was only when she stopped to look at me that I realized my posture was strange. I pretended that I was just stretching and leaned back in an apparently casual but quite uncomfortable position. As Tessa came toward me with a brightly colored drink, both she and it seemed to be expanding, and when she handed me the drink I wasn’t sure I was strong enough to hold it. I felt suddenly that everything was bigger than me, that I was in over my head, trying to handle a situation which, when I was rich, I would take to like a duck to water. But things settled down quickly as soon as she returned to her seat, and I was then glad to have the drink because I was a bit cotton-mouthed. I had gone from my first impulse of getting into her pants to fearing that she’d try to get into mine. I was not much of a drinker; water would have served as well. That summer I’d made an experimental foray into a local bar, feeling that I needed to learn to be more social. I struck up a conversation with a somber middle-aged fellow in a rumpled suit. He looked so gloomy that I regaled him with what I felt were uplifting accounts of my struggles at school. He stared at me for a while, until I sensed that all the timing was disappearing from my delivery. Finally he said, “Hey, boss, I got to go. You’re creeping me out.”
books,“Now,” Tessa said, “let’s start at the beginning: what do you think being a doctor will do for you?” “I don’t know.” My answer came out so quickly it startled her. She leaned back into the sofa — she was at one end, I at the other — with her elbow propped on the back of it and her fingers parting the hair on the side of her head. “You don’t know?” “I wish I did. Sorry.” Involuntarily singing out this last word. “No, that’s all right. That’s fine. If you don’t want to talk about it, I’m okay with that.” I didn’t share the image that I had of myself, still dark-haired but with a graying moustache, going up the gangplank of a yacht. I kept sipping my drink, looking into it as if it were a teleprompter and I were the president of the United States. The colorful liquid seemed like something I had found. I don’t know why I made people so uncomfortable. As a kind of icebreaker, I thought to ask her a question. “When people use the expression ‘rest in peace’ do you think they have some basis for saying it, or is it just wishful thinking?” I can’t imagine what made me believe that she’d have the answer to this doleful conundrum. But surely my mother’s poor health was on my mind. “You mean, about the dead?” “Sure.” Tessa looked at me for a very long time before saying anything.
books,“You know, let’s try this another time. Maybe it’s you, maybe it’s me, but at this point in time and space it’s just not happening.” I backed out of there like a crab. I felt sorry for Tessa; she probably had trouble sleeping after this weird visit from the new neighbor. I just didn’t know what to do about it — an apology would have made it seem even stranger. Thereafter, we sometimes ran into each other in the hallway adjoining our apartments, and it did not get any less awkward. I made increasingly maladroit attempts to be cordial, these being received with growing skepticism, even revulsion, until upon seeing me Tessa would dart into her apartment and slam her door. What was strange was that if I lingered in the hallway after she’d gone inside, I would always, moments later, hear her phone ring. Once she said to me, “I know you’re tracking my movements.” And another time, “Don’t think you’re fooling me.” And another, a cry, “Please stop!” “Stop what?” A mirthless laugh followed and a slammed door.
books,I made every effort to avoid these encounters. Indeed, I did start tracking her movements, if only to avoid her. She headed upstairs to work for Hoxey at exactly nine, out for the mail at ten thirty, lunch with Hoxey in his apartment Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, catered by Mountain Foodstuff, out to lunch Tuesday and Thursday, but always back by one thirty, dispatching UPS and FedEx and other outbound packages at four o’clock, at which point her workday was over. I really didn’t have a bead on her activities and so came and went from my apartment nervously. When she had men over, they seemed to linger around my door as if on the lookout for me. One strapping fellow with a shiny black goatee positioned himself as though to actually block my way. I gave him a big smile and pushed past. He smelled like motor oil. He said, “Hello, Doc.” Tessa must have told him that I was in pre-med. I said hello. I was glad to get inside, and when I looked through the little spy hole in the door, I saw into his ear. Concentrating on the Help Wanted ads calmed me down. I had discovered that I needed to look for work elsewhere, as people in town knew who I was and — this really is very funny — held my studies against me. “You can’t paint my house,” Mrs. Taliaferro said. “You’re going to be a doctor!”
books,“Not necessarily!” I said in my warmest tones, while hers cooled markedly. I have no idea why I answered her that way. I was sure I was going to be a doctor, but when I was under pressure to make conversation, it was as if all my life’s plans went up in smoke. I felt the need to persuade Mrs. Taliaferro that I would be a lifelong house painter. I kept studying the paper. I recognized that real opportunities existed for those who would sell cars or apply siding, but given the trouble I was having with my communication skills, I thought those occupations might not be up my alley. Still, I really felt that once I got my timing back — and it was a timing issue — I’d be able to look into a different set of prospects. I was very much focused on the chance to be unexceptional; if I had the opportunity to keep my head down, I meant to take it.
books,I got a job working for a very nice guy, or so I thought, named Dan Lauderdale. He was an attorney in Billings who specialized in whiplash and owned a cute little turn-of-the-century cottage in Harlowton, which he used as a weekend place — or, rather, somewhere to vacation with his secretary, who did not enjoy the same legal standing as his wife. “Lawyers like me make doctors leave the profession every day!” he joked. “Stick to painting houses.” But he was an amiable fellow with a big laugh that drew one’s attention away from his shrewd, close-set eyes. His dark brown curls were so uniform and regular as to suggest the work of a beautician. When I asked him if they were natural, he told me to mind my own business with such vituperation that I actually flinched. The previous owner of his cottage had used stolen Forest Service paint for the trim and shutters, and Dan now wanted it to be all yellow, “like sunshine, get it?” I was basically rehearsing what I thought to be the style of my current position when I said, “No problema,” but he must have sensed something wrong with my delivery, for his eyes grew narrow and he just said, “Right.” Many years later, Dan Lauderdale would become a well-known judge and part of my life.
books,I rented a pressure washer, masked everything, used a quality primer, and picked my weather for the final coat. It looked much better, but Lauderdale never responded to the bill I sent, nor the second or third. Live and learn. I wasn’t much interested in exploring my remedies, and since other revenues were unassured, I sold my car and went on a grocery binge. Also, in celebration of two months in the apartment, I bought a bed, which I put out in the middle of the living room, where I could luxuriate in all that space and gaze east, west, and south, but not north, at fine window views that were better than any painting, in that they were full of those moving, changing parts known as “Life.” I heard a timid knock on my door and called, “Enter!” I was stretched out on my new bed in my shorts reading a newspaper I’d found in the doorway to the bank. My visitor was the chief of police. I was really pleased to see him, so pleased that I easily set aside any worries over the reason for his visit. I suppose I was lonely. In a decent society, the chief of police is the one stranger you should be able to welcome into your home without reservation. In this case the first thing he told me was that I’d better get dressed, as I was going to jail. He gazed at me with sad knowingness. He had a big, warm face; it shouldn’t be misunderstood if I declare that he looked like Porky Pig, with all that guileless amiability, the same pink complexion.
books,“Tessa Larionov” — he gestured with his head in the direction of Tessa’s abode — “has charged you with making obscene phone calls to her.” “Oh?” I said. “I don’t have a phone.” For one miraculous moment, there were people passing all three windows, and the chief remarked that I needed curtains. “How bad were they supposed to be?” I tried to picture myself as the twisted man placing these calls. In a weird way, it seemed plausible. “They were not nice.”

world/europe,5 Fires That Shaped Modern London - The New York Times The fire that engulfed an apartment tower in London on Wednesday joins a list of disasters that have marked the city’s history. Few were more prominent than the Great Fire of 1666, which wiped out 80 percent of the city and led to a rebuilding that laid the groundwork for London as we know it today. Although modern Londoners live a life relatively sheltered from such destruction, some fires in recent history have shaped it. Here are five examples from the last 100 years. The Crystal Palace, built originally in Hyde Park for an industrial exhibition in 1851, was transferred to what was then the rural outskirts in southeast London a year later. There, the iron and glass structure stood as a Victorian-era leisure center, with a palm house and fountains. In 1936, it burned to the ground in a spectacular blaze that attracted a crowd of spectators. Among them, Winston Churchill, who later became prime minister, remarked that it was “the end of an age.” The names of a neighborhood and a soccer club recall the landmark, and park and some dinosaur displays remain on the site. In the final days of 1940, the Germans dropped incendiary bombs on London that started fires across the city. The night of Dec. 29 is remembered as “the Second Great Fire of London,” one of the worst of the Blitz, a series of air attacks against British cities during World War II.
world/europe,Two days later, The Times carried a first-person account of the bombing from William W. White, an Associated Press reporter. “We put in three calls to the Fire Department, but they were too busy to help us, for other bigger fires were raging in the neighborhood,” Mr. White wrote. “‘The building can’t be saved,’ somebody yelled and we ‘ran for it.’” Firefighters managed to save the iconic St. Paul’s Cathedral from the flames, reportedly on direct orders from the prime minister, Mr. Churchill. Denmark Street, on the edges of the Soho neighborhood, has been home to guitar shops and venues for emerging musicians for decades. But before commercial development in the area, it was the site of scruffy night life, including clubs that patrons entered by yelling up for a key. In 1980, a fire in two clubs killed 37 people when a disgruntled customer set fire to one of them. Both venues were friendly escapes for club-goers of many nationalities, including Colombians who worked nearby and came off shifts to dance salsa. Accounts of the blaze said it was devastating, but according to an investigation in the Independent newspaper, few remember it today. A fire that started on a wooden escalator in the King’s Cross London Underground station killed 31 people and injured many. Many commuters at the time had ignored a smoking ban in place in the subway system since 1984, and an inquest found that the fire was caused by a dropped match. Witnesses speaking to The New York Times described a scene of panic, with commuters clawing desperately toward the exits, their clothing and hair aflame. The fire led to the gradual replacement of wooden escalators and a stricter enforcement of the smoking ban.
world/europe,Six people, including three children, died after they were trapped in a fire in an apartment building in South London. The local council took the blame for failing to address fire hazards in the building.
sports/olympics,U.S. Women Jump, Spin and Soar to Gymnastics Gold - The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO — Led by the world’s best gymnast, Simone Biles, the powerhouse American women’s gymnastics team romped to the gold medal at the Rio Olympics Tuesday. The team of Biles, Laurie Hernandez, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and Madison Kocian lived up to expectations as prohibitive favorites by putting up the highest total score on every apparatus. Russia won silver and China bronze. The margin of victory was a whopping 8 points. The medal, the Americans’ third team gold after 2012 and 1996, came in the final Olympics for the national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi, a crucial player in the rise of American gymnastics for more than 30 years. Here’s how they did it. The Americans opened up with the vault. Two of them, Raisman and Biles, tried the difficult Amanar, in which the vaulter does two and a half twists with a blind landing. Raisman scored a 15.833, and Biles did even better at 15.933, despite making a hop on her landing. After one rotation, the Americans were already out in front, by 0.7 points over Russia, who performed on the bars. The bars were the one chance of the day to compete for team members Douglas, the 2012 all-around champion, and Kocian, a bars specialist and a 2015 world champion in the event. Both delivered. Douglas got lots of height on her release skills and hit her handstands, then stuck her double layout dismount to get a 15.766. Kocian performed one of the most difficult routines at the Games, and nailed it, scoring a stellar 15.933.
sports/olympics,The United States extended its lead to a comfortable 4 points over China. Russia slipped to third. No serious mishaps for the Americans on the sometimes perilous beam. Raisman hit her double Arabian dismount for a 15.0; Hernandez gave a disciplined performance for a 15.233. The incomparable Biles survived a balance check and made just a small hop on her dismount — one of the hardest in the world, a full-twisting double tuck — for a 15.3. Because they were the top qualifiers, the Americans got to end on floor exercise. That was considered an advantage because the Americans’ floor scores tend to be high, and crowd support for the floor is big. But with a nearly 5-point lead over China, it hardly mattered. Hernandez gave her typical charismatic performance, starting with a wink for the crowd. The scoring system tends to favor difficult tumbling over choreography. Hernandez, however, has helped to bring artistry and dance back into American gymnastics, to the applause of many. Biles’s second tumbling pass includes a double layout with a half-twist and a blind landing, a move dubbed the Biles because she was the first gymnast to land it in top-level competition. Great performances have come to be expected from the American women’s team. They didn’t even need a great performance to win on Tuesday. But they delivered one anyway.

world/europe,As Ties With U.S. Cool, Europeans Look to Forge Other Alliances - The New York Times WASHINGTON — The weather, and her reception here, were far colder than when she visited last summer during the Obama administration, but Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign minister, made it clear that she can handle a chill in the air. “I think we are entering into a different phase of our relationship,” Ms. Mogherini said Friday in a 30-minute interview, adding, “A more transactional approach means Europeans will be more transactional, and we will base our approach on our interests.” But Ms. Mogherini said she had received important reassurances from top administration officials on the Iran nuclear deal and on Russian sanctions. “I was reassured by what I heard in my meetings on the intention to stick to the full strict implementation of the agreement in all its parts,” Ms. Mogherini said of the Iran deal. On Russian sanctions, she said President Trump’s policy was essentially identical to former President Barack Obama’s and to Europe’s. Ms. Mogherini met on Thursday at the State Department with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; at the White House with Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser; and with Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump who is also the president’s son-in-law. Ms. Mogherini said she and Trump administration officials remained in disagreement on some issues, including refugees and migration, climate change and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “I will go back to Brussels clearly with the sense that, yes, we have differences,” she said.
world/europe,More broadly, Ms. Mogherini said that an administration that has made “America First” its guiding principle will find that Europe can be equally self-interested. And she politely reminded everyone just how vital Europe is to the economy and security of the United States. Mr. Trump has a jaundiced view of the European Union, seeing it as a trading rival and predicting that other member nations will follow Britain in voting to leave. His attitude is such a stark contrast with that of Mr. Obama that the European Council president, Donald Tusk, recently placed Mr. Trump on a list of threats to the union alongside radical Islam. Ms. Mogherini said she sensed a gradual shift in the administration’s attitudes. “I think that it is becoming more and more clear that the European Union is an indispensable partner in some fields,” she said. But she is not counting on a complete transformation. “In international relations, you don’t base your work on hope,” she said. She bluntly warned the administration not to nominate an ambassador to the European Union who is critical of the bloc, as has been rumored, or attempt to negotiate a bilateral trading agreement with Britain for years. “The European Union is here to stay,” she said, adding that even though Britain may leave, “the other 27 will stick together and stay together because it’s in their interests to do so. I’ve never seen them more determined.” Ms. Mogherini implied that the European Union could start picking off some of the United States’ most likely free-trade partners.
world/europe,Among Mr. Trump’s first actions was to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trading pact. China is already hoping to replace the United States as a trading partner in Asia, and Ms. Mogherini suggested that her bloc could do the same elsewhere. A deal between the European Union and Canada is scheduled to be finalized next week, and other deals could be in the offing “as our partners in the world are looking more and more to Europe as a reliable partner.”
world/middleeast,Saudis Face Mounting Pressure Over Civilian Deaths in Yemen Conflict - The New York Times CAIRO — Saudi Arabia and its allies faced mounting international pressure on Tuesday to halt a bombing campaign in Yemen the day after airstrikes killed dozens of people at a village wedding on the Red Sea coast. The attack occurred Monday morning in the village of Wahija, south of the city of Mokha, and appeared to be one of the deadliest involving civilians since the military campaign began in March. Witnesses said Monday that at least 70 people had been killed in tents set up for the wedding. On Tuesday, two local medical officials said as many as 81 people had died. The attack on the wedding, along with a string of recent airstrikes that have led to large numbers of civilian deaths, has fueled accusations that the Saudi-led military coalition is conducting an increasingly reckless offensive as it tries to defeat the Houthis, a rebel movement from the north of Yemen. The strikes have prompted a series of unusually angry statements from normally cautious United Nations officials who have singled out the coalition for causing the majority of civilian deaths in Yemen’s six-month war. There have also been signs that the Obama administration could face more questions over its military support of the air campaign. On Tuesday, Representative Ted W. Lieu, Democrat of California, sent the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a letter citing reports of civilian deaths and requesting that the United States “cease aiding coalition airstrikes in Yemen until the coalition demonstrates that they will institute proper safeguards to prevent civilian deaths.”
world/middleeast,A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition denied on Monday that coalition warplanes were responsible for the wedding bombing, telling Reuters that there had been no coalition operations in the area for days. On Tuesday, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, speaking to reporters in New York, said the Yemeni authorities would investigate the allegations. He added that the coalition sought to “minimize casualties” when possible. Mr. Jubeir said the Saudi-led coalition was often blamed for damage done by the Houthis. “We need to be careful about facts and fiction,” he said. Frustration with the coalition burst into public after months of private grumbling by diplomats over the airstrikes but also over a continuing blockade that has caused shortages of food, fuel and medicine. In Geneva on Tuesday, Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said in a news briefing that the coalition was “indubitably responsible for the naval blockade of Yemen’s main seaports.” The blockade, he added, is exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that has left four out of five Yemenis requiring assistance, and 1.5 million people internally displaced. Yet most of the diplomatic irritation over the last few days has been fueled by the airstrikes. On Monday, after calling for an end to the bombing in his address to the General Assembly, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, released a statement condemning the wedding party bombing. He warned that “any intentional attack against civilians is considered a serious violation of humanitarian law.”
world/middleeast,Mr. Ban called on all parties involved in the Yemeni conflict “from inside and outside the country to immediately cease all military activities.” Mr. Colville said that civilians were being killed by “an increasing number of airstrikes targeting bridges and highways.” A recent report by the high commissioner’s office found that almost two-thirds of reported civilian deaths “had allegedly been caused by coalition airstrikes, which were also responsible for almost two-thirds of damaged or destroyed civilian public buildings,” Mr. Colville said. The United Nations has been trying to investigate human rights violations by all sides in the Yemen war. But Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have tried to block any international inquiry. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly dismissed accusations that airstrikes are killing civilians and has instead blamed the Houthis for the deaths. Mr. Colville released new casualty estimates for the war on Tuesday, saying at least 2,355 civilians were killed from March 27 to Thursday. A previous estimate, through the end of June, had put the civilian toll at 1,527. The Obama administration, which counts Saudi Arabia as one of its closest Arab allies and backs the ousted Yemeni government, has provided intelligence to the war effort as well as logistical support, like refueling, to coalition warplanes. In a letter sent Tuesday to Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the coming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr. Lieu requested that the Defense Department clarify whether American officials knew how many civilians had died as a result of coalition airstrikes, whether civilians were being targeted and what types of assistance the United States was providing to the coalition.
world/middleeast,In an interview, Mr. Lieu, who served in the Air Force as a judge advocate general, said it was unclear from news reports whether the coalition was “grossly negligent or intentionally targeting civilians.” “There is clearly no military value in a wedding party,” he added.
nyregion,Schumer Wants Bus Safety Grades Posted on Windshields - The New York Times A federal law requiring bus companies to post safety ratings where passengers can see them might have prevented a deadly bus crash in Queens last month, Senator Chuck Schumer said, if riders had known where to look for the evaluations. Mr. Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Sunday that he wants to strengthen that law, which he helped pass in 2012, by amending it to require bus operators to post restaurant-style letter grades on their vehicles’ windshields. “While there are safety grades when someone gets on a bus, they have no idea what they are,” Mr. Schumer said at a news conference at the Roosevelt Island Tramway plaza, along a stretch of Second Avenue at 59th Street where heavy traffic, including charter and tour buses, rumbled by. “They are required to be posted on the websites, but they are posted in such a small, hidden way no one sees them.” Since 2012, bus companies have received one of three safety ratings — satisfactory, conditional and unsatisfactory — from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, a division of the Department of Transportation. Mr. Schumer wants those ratings converted to letter grades — A, B and C — and the grades posted on bus windshields. Mr. Schumer displayed a mock-up of what the grades might look like, noting their similarity to the grades required by New York City in the windows of bars and restaurants, a system Mr. Schumer praised as a success.
nyregion,“We need this change,” Mr. Schumer said. “The law is on the books, but the federal D.O.T. has not enforced it in an appropriate way. We need them to do that, and do that now, and it could go a long way to preventing the kind of horrible crash we saw in Queens.” Around 6:15 a.m. on Sept. 18, at the start of the Monday morning rush, a charter bus operated by the Queens-based Dahlia Group ran a red light at the intersection of Main Street and Northern Boulevard and struck a city bus. The collision killed the Dahlia driver, Raymond D. Mong, and two others, and injured 16 people. The charter bus was traveling at 58 miles per hour — nearly twice the speed limit — at the time of the crash. Mr. Mong, it was later learned, had been fired in 2015 as a bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority after an accident in which a sedan he was driving crashed into two cars on Interstate 95 in New Haven and he fled the scene. He received a suspended jail sentence and was placed on probation after being convicted of driving under the influence and evading arrest. Dahlia, Mr. Schumer said, “had a terrible safety record — 11 violations — and the driver, this driver who caused these deaths, had been previously fired from the M.T.A. because of a D.U.I.” “But the passengers who got on the bus had no idea Dahlia was not a safe company,” he said. “That’s the tragedy of this.”
nyregion,Last year, a Dahlia bus operated by another company, VMC East Coast, overturned during snowy weather en route to a Connecticut casino, injuring 30 people. In the last two years, Dahlia buses have been ticketed for speeding at least four times, including two instances when one of its buses was exceeding the speed limit by at least 15 miles per hour, according to federal records, which also ranks Dahlia in the bottom 20 percent on unsafe driving. For all that, as of Sunday, Dahlia still rates as “satisfactory” for safety on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website — the equivalent of an “A” under the grading system Mr. Schumer proposes. Still, Mr. Schumer speculated that had the letter-grading system already been in place for a while, “Dahlia would have had no choice but to be far more careful. They might not have hired a bus driver who had had a previous D.U.I. conviction.” Jeremy Walker, whose Massachusetts-based bus company, Yep Tour, has paid a six-figure fine as part of its battle with New York City officials over permits and routes, said on Sunday that he agreed with Mr. Schumer that bus company safety is an issue in need of attention. But Mr. Walker doubted that a letter-grade system would alter passenger choices, which he said are based primarily on ticket price. “To just give someone an A, B, C, does he really think that’s going to change people riding?” he said.
nyregion,Mr. Walker also criticized the underlying ratings. “The problem is those grades don’t specifically tell the complete truth,” he said. “It’s like a two-year review, and if a company makes changes, nobody’s going to know that” until the next ratings are issued, he said. On Sunday, Mr. Schumer also said that many operators have no violations, and that highly visible letter grades would prompt passengers to use the safer carriers while forcing the unsafe ones to improve.
technology,How Netflix Is Deepening Our Cultural Echo Chambers - The New York Times When “One Day at a Time” started its run on CBS in December 1975, it became an instant hit and remained so for almost a decade. In its first year, “One Day at a Time,” a sitcom about working-class families produced by the TV impresario Norman Lear, regularly attracted 17 million viewers every week, according to Nielsen. Mr. Lear’s other comedies were even bigger hits: One out of every three households with a television watched “All in the Family,” for instance. Last week, a new version of “One Day at a Time” started on Netflix. Critics praised the remake for its explorations of single parenthood and class struggle, a theme that has faded from TV since Mr. Lear’s heyday. Yet, well intentioned and charming as the new streaming version may be, there’s a crucial aspect of the old “One Day at a Time” that it will almost certainly fail to replicate: broad cultural reach. The two versions of “One Day at a Time” are noteworthy bookends in the history of television, and, by extension, the history of mass culture in America. The shows are separated by 40 years of technological advances — a progression from the over-the-air broadcast era in which Mr. Lear made it big, to the cable age of MTV and CNN and HBO, to, finally, the modern era of streaming services like Netflix. Each new technology allowed a leap forward in choice, flexibility and quality; the “Golden Age of TV” offers so much choice that some critics wonder if it’s become overwhelming.
technology,It’s not just TV, either. Across the entertainment business, from music to movies to video games, technology has flooded us with a profusion of cultural choice. More good stuff to watch and listen to isn’t bad. But the new “One Day at a Time” offers a chance to reflect on what we have lost in embracing tech-abetted abundance. Last year’s presidential election and its aftermath were dominated by discussions of echo chambers and polarization; as I’ve argued before, we’re all splitting into our own self-constructed bubbles of reality. What’s less discussed is the polarization of culture, and the new echo chambers within which we hear about and experience today’s cultural hits. There will never again be a show like “One Day at a Time” or “All in the Family” — shows that derived their power not solely from their content, which might not hold up to today’s more high-minded affairs, but also from their ubiquity. There’s just about nothing as popular today as old sitcoms were; the only bits of shared culture that come close are periodic sporting events, viral videos, memes and occasional paroxysms of political outrage (see Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech and the aftermath). Instead, we’re returning to the cultural era that predated radio and TV, an era in which entertainment was fragmented and bespoke, and satisfying a niche was a greater economic imperative than entertaining the mainstream.
technology,“We’re back to normal, in a way, because before there was broadcasting, there wasn’t much of a shared culture,” said Lance Strate, a professor of communication at Fordham University. “For most of the history of civilization, there was nothing like TV. It was a really odd moment in history to have so many people watching the same thing at the same time.” That’s not to romanticize the TV era. At its peak, broadcast TV was derided for its shallowness, for its crass commercialism, for the way it celebrated conformity and rejected heterodoxy, and mostly for often not being very creative or entertaining. Neil Postman wrote that we were using TV to “amuse ourselves to death,” and Newton N. Minow, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President John F. Kennedy, famously called it a “vast wasteland.” Yet for a brief while, from the 1950s to the late 1980s, broadcast television served cultural, social and political roles far greater than the banality of its content would suggest. Because it featured little choice, TV offered something else: the raw material for a shared culture. Television was the thing just about everyone else was watching at the same time as you. In its enforced similitude, it became a kind of social glue, stitching together a new national identity across a vast, growing and otherwise diverse nation.
technology,“What we gained was a shared identity and shared experience,” Mr. Strate said. “The famous example was Kennedy’s funeral, where the nation mourned together in a way that had never happened before. But it was also our experience watching ‘I Love Lucy’ and ‘All in the Family’ that created a shared set of references that everyone knew.” As the broadcast era changed into one of cable and then streaming, TV was transformed from a wasteland into a bubbling sea of creativity. But it has become a sea in which everyone swims in smaller schools. Only around 12 percent of television households, or about 14 million to 15 million people, regularly tuned into “NCIS” and “The Big Bang Theory,” the two most popular network shows of the 2015-16 season, according to Nielsen. Before 2000, those ratings would not even have qualified them as Top 10 shows. HBO’s “Game of Thrones” is the biggest prestige drama on cable, but its record-breaking finale drew only around nine million viewers. Netflix does not release viewership numbers, but a few independent measurement companies have come up with ways to estimate them. One such company, Symphony Advanced Media, said Netflix’s biggest original drama last year, “Stranger Things,” was seen by about 14 million adults in the month after it first aired. “Fuller House,” Netflix’s reboot of the broadcast sitcom “Full House,” attracted an audience of nearly 16 million. On Wednesday, Symphony said that about 300,000 viewers watched the new “One Day at a Time” in its first three days on Netflix. (These numbers are for the entire season, not for single episodes.)
technology,For perspective, during much of the 1980s, a broadcast show that attracted 14 million to 16 million viewers would have been in danger of cancellation. We are not yet at the nadir of the broadcast era; cord-cutting is accelerating but has still not become a mainstream practice, and streaming services only just surpassed majority penetration. So these trends have a ways more to go. As people pull back from broadcast and cable TV and jump deeper into streaming, we’re bound to see more shows with smaller audiences. “This is just generally true with how blockbusters across the media are going,” said James G. Webster, a professor of the School of Communication at Northwestern. “Some big ones could get bigger than ever, but generally the audience for everything else is just peanuts.” A spokesman for Netflix pointed out that even if audiences were smaller than in the past, its shows still had impact. “Making a Murderer” set off a re-examination of a widely criticized murder trial, for instance, while “Orange Is the New Black” was one of the first shows to feature a transgender actor, Laverne Cox. I buy this argument; obviously, powerful cultural products can produce an impact even if they’re not seen by everyone. But I suspect the impacts, like the viewership, tend to be restricted along the same social and cultural echo chambers into which we’ve split ourselves in the first place. Those effects do not approach the vast ways that TV once remade the culture: how everyone of a certain age knows the idioms of “Seinfeld” (“It shrinks?”), or followed the “Cheers” romance of Diane and Sam, or how a show like “All in the Family” inspired a national conversation about the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement.
technology,It’s possible we’re not at the end of the story. Some youngsters might argue that the internet has produced its own kind of culture, one that will become a fount of shared references for years to come. What if “Chewbacca Mom” and the blue and black/white and gold dress that broke the internet one day become part of our library of globally recognized references, like the corniest catchphrases of television’s past, whether from “Seinfeld” or “Diff’rent Strokes”? That could happen. At the risk of alienating the youngsters, though, I’ll offer this rejoinder: “What you talkin’ about, Willis?”
business/dealbook,Deutsche Bank Fined in Plan to Help Russians Launder $10 Billion - The New York Times Deutsche Bank agreed on Monday to pay a $425 million fine to New York State’s main financial regulator to settle charges that it helped Russian investors launder as much as $10 billion through its branches in Moscow, London and New York. The punishment represents the latest regulatory black eye for Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest. In the last decade, it has been implicated in several financial scandals, including pushing toxic mortgages on investors and manipulating London’s main lending rate for its own financial gain. Deutsche Bank also agreed to pay 163 million pounds, or about $204 million, in civil penalties in a separate settlement with the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain in the matter, the bank and the regulator said on Tuesday. In its investigation, the New York State Department of Financial Services found that between 2011 and 2015, a group of Deutsche Bank executives based mainly in Moscow and London helped wealthy Russians send money overseas by arranging stock trades that had no economic purpose other than disguising what the client was doing. What was known as the Russian mirror trading scheme “occurred while the bank was on clear notice of serious and widespread compliance issues dating back a decade,” said Maria T. Vullo, the superintendent for financial services at the department. “The offsetting trades here lacked economic purpose and could have been used to facilitate money laundering or enable other illicit conduct.”
business/dealbook,Deutsche Bank, under its new chief executive, John Cryan, has been moving aggressively to restructure its trading and banking unit and reach deals with regulators worldwide in the many investigations into its conduct. An agreement with the Justice Department late last year to pay $7.2 billion for selling dubious mortgage securities addressed the most significant of these regulatory actions, given the size of the penalty. The Russian scheme, while much smaller in scale and in terms of economic harm to the bank, nevertheless highlights what has been a pervasive culture at Deutsche of skirting regulations to pad profits and personal bonuses, the Department of Financial Services said. In its order, the department said the scheme started in the years after the financial crisis when trading revenue in Deutsche’s Moscow office dropped by half. Despite misgivings, traders proceeded with the transactions to secure commissions in slow markets, the order said. In one case, investigators found that a supervisor in the Moscow office had been paid $3.8 million for “consulting agreements” by the companies behind the trades. Many of these dollar-based mirror transactions flowed through the office of Deutsche’s New York bank, which regulators here have often criticized for its lax compliance and monitoring systems. More than $10 billion in laundered money was directed toward London and New York from Moscow, investigators found. The department discovered that Deutsche executives in Moscow had plenty of opportunities to crack down on scheme but did not do so.
business/dealbook,And in particular, the bank’s Know Your Customer screens, a crucial cog in its compliance department that analyzes the identity and intent of a prospective client, failed on numerous occasions. In a statement, Deutsche Bank said it had cooperated with the investigation and had set aside sufficient cash in its reserves to cover the fine. As part of the punishment, Deutsche agreed to hire an independent monitor, who after being approved by the Department of Financial Services will review the bank’s relevant compliance system.

science,The Orionid Meteor Shower Will Peak Tonight. Don’t Expect Much. - The New York Times Thursday night’s Orionid meteor shower will most likely be a bust, thanks to the pesky moon. The Orionids are named because they appear to radiate from the direction of the Orion constellation. But during their peak Thursday night and Friday morning this year, they’re getting upstaged by a brighter neighbor in the sky. “Turns out tonight the moon will park itself very close to the Orionid radiant and completely wash out the Orionid meteors,” said Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. The moon will be a waning gibbous, which means that more than half of it will be shining. But even if that bright white orb wasn’t masking the show, the shower would probably still be lackluster, according to Dr. Cooke. In recent years the Orionid shower has been pretty weak, showing only between 15 and 20 meteors during the peak. During its most active years, there can be as many as 80 or 90 meteors per hour streaking some 147,000 miles per hour through the atmosphere at the shower’s peak. The Orionids are like the encore performance for Halley’s comet. Every year Earth passes twice through the particles that the dirty snowball left behind during one of its many journeys around the sun. We saw its first performance earlier this year in May with the Eta Aquarids. Despite tonight’s poor meteor shower forecast, you can still attempt to see some cosmic fireworks when the moon checks out right before dawn.
science,“If you can stay up late enough, then you can catch a glimpse of it,” said Jackie Faherty, an astronomer from the American Museum of Natural History. “Or alternatively just get up really, really early before sunrise.” If you don’t see any streaking fireballs tonight, don’t fret too much because in December another shower, the Geminids, is expected to brighten the night sky with between 120 and 160 meteors per hour. So even if the moon is shining, you’ll still get a good show.
world/middleeast,Businesses’ Doors Creak Open in a West Bank ‘Ghost Town,’ Decades After Massacre - The New York Times HEBRON, West Bank — It took Mohammad Abu Halaweh a good 10 minutes to pry open the rusted metal doors of his butcher shop for the first time in two decades. He had the key, an old-fashioned iron number as big as his hand. But he had to press a sandaled foot against the door and leverage his body weight to yank off a second lock. A handful of curious children had gathered by the time he finally finished the job with the help of a hammer. Inside, Mr. Abu Halaweh found what he had left back in 1994, when the Israeli military shuttered the shops of al-Sahla Street in the Old City of Hebron after an American-born Israeli doctor’s murderous rampage left 29 Muslim worshipers dead at the nearby Tomb of the Patriarchs. A scale covered in dust. The back room where the goats were killed, still a bit rank. An ancient ceiling fan. The shell of a refrigerator with empty meat hooks. “This is the table where we used to chop the meat,” he said. The reminiscing was cut short by an Israeli soldier, who ordered him to close up once again. It took Mr. Abu Halaweh, a bearded man of 50 in a gray jalabiya, almost as long to get the warped doors secured anew as it did to open them.
world/middleeast,This was the first Friday of Ramadan, when the Palestinian mayor of Hebron announced that 70 of the 300-odd shops on al-Sahla Street could reopen. But the Israeli military insisted that it had agreed to only seven, citing security concerns in a place where clashes with settlers are common. So al-Sahla, once a thriving marketplace off the storied Shuhada Street, remained a ghost town, as the Israeli human rights group B’tselem termed it in 2007. “It’s a progressive process,” said Matthieu Desselas of the Hebron office of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which helped negotiate the deal. “The more shops are open, the more movement there will be. It’s a long-term strategy.” Shway-shway, as they say in Arabic: slowly, slowly. Too slow, shop owners and residents complained. They said seven stores would not be enough to bring people back, especially since Israeli checkpoints surround the area and prevent Palestinian cars, and thus quantities of goods, from entering. “You need three things to open a shop: owner, product and customers,” said Issa Amro of Youth Against Settlements, an advocacy group. “This is propaganda; on the ground, nothing is changing. It’s increasing the mistrust.” The Old City of Hebron may be the most tense and fraught patch of the occupied West Bank. The remaining Palestinian families report a near-constant standoff with Israeli settlers, who began squatting in the neighborhood — where Jewish history is centuries old — shortly after Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 war. Foreigners in white and red shirts and matching vehicles labeled Temporary International Presence in Hebron stand vigil to document problems, as soldiers and tanks stalk the still street.
world/middleeast,On Friday morning, a religious Jew with prayer fringes hanging over his shorts jogged through. Then came a group of European tourists in sun hats, cameras at the ready. New blue street signs, in Hebrew and English but not Arabic, call it Emek Hebron Street. Ghassan Abu Hadid, who has lived all his 32 years on this block, saw a different scene in his mind. The central taxi stand on one corner, buzzing with fares. Across the street, a stand filled with fresh produce. Behind the doors covered in peeling white paint, a home-appliance store. Next to it, a poultry market, and next to that a fragrant spice shop. “You could barely walk here because it was so packed with people,” Mr. Abu Hadid recalled. That was before Baruch Goldstein’s 1994 massacre at the tomb, which Muslims call the Ibrahimi Mosque, and before the 1997 Hebron Protocol that divided the city of 200,000 Palestinians and perhaps 700 Jews, leaving this section under the control of the Israeli military. Before the violent second intifada that stretched from 2000 to 2005, when Palestinians killed 22 Israelis in Hebron, including 17 security officers and 10-month-old Shalhevet Pass, according to B’tselem, and Israeli forces killed 88 Palestinians, nine of them minors. “The declared commitment to free movement and unity of the city was rendered meaningless,” the group’s 2007 report says, citing a new curfew and street closings that led Palestinians to abandon more than 1,000 apartments above the shuttered storefronts. “What was once the vibrant heart of Hebron has become a ghost town.”
world/middleeast,Back then, Abed Muhtaseb’s souvenir shop, across from the Jewish entrance to the revered tomb — which also draws international tourists — and Khaled Fakhouri’s pottery workshop next door were the only businesses open on al-Sahla Street, according to the locals. A year ago, the Red Cross persuaded the Israelis to permit a few more to unlock their doors: There is now a tiny cafe and two places that type up official documents, residents said, but they operate only a few hours a day for lack of traffic. Now, another handful got the go-ahead, including several owned by Mr. Abu Hadid’s extended family. He has put in a new tile floor and painted the walls pink in one storefront, planning to invest about $8,000 to create a small grocery. On Friday, he examined the ancient, broken-down machines of the little factory where he used to help his grandfather grind wheat and local spices like zatar. And he put a cage of pigeons a few doors down: maybe a pet shop? “I’m going to buy a fridge, I’m going to bring some shelves,” he said of the grocery-to-be. As for the factory: “We’re going to renovate all these machines and get it back up and running.” But, he warned, “If they don’t remove the checkpoints, this whole thing is for nothing.” How will shop owners stock supplies when the turnstile at the checkpoint prevents them from even bringing through a handcart? Why would shoppers bother leaving the sprawling Old City souk, with its wondrous smells of baking sweets, to venture down to this contested, dilapidated stretch?
world/middleeast,The mayor, Daoud Zatari, said that unless storefronts on both sides were given permits – something the military had so far declined – he would “tell the shop owners not to open.” “It’s not logical; any security justification doesn’t make any sense,” Mr. Zatari said. “I will not be in a good position with my people to have this shop open on one side, and this shop closed on the other side.” Tamar Toledano, a military spokeswoman, said she had no idea why the mayor had announced that 70 shops would reopen, raising false hopes. “For now, it’s seven,” she said. “It’s a very complicated city. It’s little steps. It’s one step at a time.” Mr. Abu Hadid took a little step on Friday. Actually, he took a seat, placing a plastic chair outside the shop, something he said Israeli soldiers had not allowed in a long time.
business/dealbook,A Gay, Latino Partner Tests Goldman’s Button-Down Culture - The New York Times R. Martin Chavez possesses the light-filled office of a Goldman Sachs partner, with a sweeping view of the Statue of Liberty. But what sets his office apart is the gallery of objects and books arrayed behind the desk. There is the rose-petal birthday present from his husband — a framed card that says “I love you” in Braille. Below that stands a picture of a wiry terrier named Galahad, acquired as a “sobriety dog” when Mr. Chavez stopped drinking in the 1990s. A few feet down, a basketball perches on a shelf. “Basketball is so not me that I decided to put it up there so people could say, ‘What is Marty doing with a basketball in his office?’” he said, bursting into a peal of laughter. Mr. Chavez, who is 52 and has a thick beard, represents a departure from the button-down partners of Goldman lore — plutocrats who wore their power on their sleeves and turned the bank into the most vaunted, feared and secretive company on Wall Street. Goldman’s reputation took a beating after the 2008 financial crisis, when Rolling Stone called the company a “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.” The current presidential race, echoing with populist, anti-Wall Street messages, is putting the company’s ruthless reputation in the spotlight again.
business/dealbook,Today Goldman is trying to change not only that public image, but also some of the central tenets of its culture, like the secrecy and reliance on back-room dealings. The company’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has said he wants Goldman to be thought of as a tech company — putting it in direct competition for talent with the Googles and Facebooks of the world. No one is more central to these efforts than Mr. Chavez. Mr. Chavez, who was promoted just over two years ago to oversee the company’s 9,000 or so computer engineers — nearly a third of the staff — is pushing the 147-year-old company to, among other things, share more of its data and software with clients. His centerpiece project, Marquee, gives clients access to sophisticated trading data previously available only by phoning a Goldman employee. Marquee is so closely associated with Mr. Chavez, in fact, that it was initially called “Martee,” a play on his first name. But it has faced internal resistance. Some colleagues complain that the company is handing out valuable information while paving the way for job cuts. Mr. Chavez has responded forcefully, according to people who witnessed some of these conversations. “He basically said something to the effect of: ‘If your job is a purely manual job and you are just clicking buttons, you should look to upgrade your skills set now,’” said Adam Korn, a trading executive. “He was pretty direct.”
business/dealbook,Some of Mr. Chavez’s ideas about openness date to his early years in Silicon Valley, where sharing is a religion. They haven’t always worked out: At one start-up, he proposed publicly posting everyone’s salaries, an unpopular idea. For Mr. Chavez, transparency is a kind of personal credo. He displays his gay and Latino identities proudly, as well as the Japanese tattoos on his arms. Conversations with him routinely turn to the intricacies of marrying his husband, a Briton, and raising their baby son, who was born to a surrogate in California. He urges his colleagues to open up more as well, arguing that it can serve as an antidote to the negative public image of Goldman. Mr. Chavez represents broad pressures across the financial industry. The 2008 economic crisis and the regulations that followed it are forcing banks to become less opaque and more technologically savvy and efficient. This has shifted the center of power in the business away from the trading desks, where it was before the crisis, and toward the programmers and engineers — until recently dismissed as the geeks in the back office. Particularly at a place like Goldman, the changes can be an uncomfortable fit with business practices and a culture that have been built up over decades. Charles M. Elson, an expert on corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said that Goldman, born as an adviser to corporations, is not used to operating out in the open.
business/dealbook,“Fundamentally, it’s trying to refit an old car,” said Mr. Elson, who is the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, named for the man who ran Goldman in the 1980s. “It’s not buffing that’s going to do it,” Mr. Elson said. “In this new environment you have to rethink the whole chassis.” Mr. Elson said that Goldman went through a similar change when it converted from a partnership to a publicly traded company. That led to mass departures and internal battles, though Goldman emerged more profitable. It’s not clear that the current slimming-down and opening-up will lead to the same results. Mr. Chavez says that if efforts like his are successful, clients will see “a very different configuration of the financial services industry than the one we have now.” Goldman will still have the chief product of a bank — money to lend and invest — but he thinks that the ways in which customers get access to that money will rely more on software and less on the bankers who traditionally delivered Goldman’s services. Mr. Chavez grew up in Albuquerque with two parents who had not graduated from college and four siblings. All five of the children went to Harvard. His mother, a court stenographer whose parents had come from Mexico and Spain to the United States as immigrants, told Mr. Chavez that, because he was Hispanic, “To get half as far, you have to work twice as hard.”
business/dealbook,He was the statistician for the basketball team and read the Encyclopaedia Britannica front to back. “I have no idea how he did it,” his mother, Rose Chavez, said recently. He earned the nickname “motormouth” from an uncle. There was, though, at least one thing he didn’t talk about: his sexuality. He only came out the day after he defended his doctoral dissertation, in medical information sciences, at Stanford. The difficulty of being in the closet is part of what convinced Mr. Chavez of the importance of transparency. “It can be hard to be out — or one can imagine that it might be hard, which is more often the case,” he wrote in a memo to colleagues in 2011. “But if that imagination leads to holding back, manufacturing alternative stories of how you spent your weekend or where you spent your time off, that not only impacts your peace of mind, it also has negative consequences for your career.” When a recruiter from Goldman contacted him in the early 1990s, he worried that Wall Street wouldn’t take to his sexuality as kindly as Silicon Valley had. At the time he worked for a software start-up and had little notion of what Goldman even did. “I didn’t think much about Wall Street,” he said recently. “I thought I was being clever in getting a free trip to New York City.” During interviews at the bank, he said, he was impressed by his interviewers’ quick wits. And his future boss took it in stride when Mr. Chavez said he was gay.
business/dealbook,Soon Mr. Chavez was plunged into Goldman’s early efforts to automate its trading business with a computer system, SecDB, which is still the spine of its operations. Within the elite trading division where Mr. Chavez was placed, the J. Aron & Company operation — a shop that groomed many of the company’s leaders — he worked with Mr. Blankfein, now the chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, now Goldman’s president. Mr. Chavez struggled, though, with drinking, a vice he attributes to an overindulgence in New York’s gay night life. While going through Alcoholics Anonymous in 1997, Mr. Chavez got Galahad, the dog, to try to help him stay sober. He also decided he wanted a change of scene — pulling a “geographic” in the parlance of A.A. Over the protests of Mr. Cohn, he briefly took a job at another Wall Street company, Credit Suisse, then jumped back into the start-up world, building a company, Kiodex, that wrote software to evaluate energy-trading risks. Kiodex had a rough ride. First, the tech bubble burst. Then, Mr. Chavez decided to collaborate with Enron right before the energy company went bust. Sean Patrick Maloney, one of Mr. Chavez’s deputies at Kiodex, said Mr. Chavez’s outsider status gave him an unusual problem-solving creativity. “When you cross lines of difference in life — and you embrace things that to others seem taboo — it absolutely changes the way your brain works,” said Mr. Maloney, who is now a Democratic congressman from upstate New York. “He sees things that others miss.”
business/dealbook,Still, his approach would occasionally go astray. It was at Kiodex where Mr. Chavez proposed making everyone’s salary public. Tom Farley, then Kiodex’s chief financial officer, says he talked Mr. Chavez out of that. “The type of transparency that Marty espouses isn’t for everyone,” said Mr. Farley, who is now in charge of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Chavez, for his part, says the episode helped teach him not to prize “radical transparency for its own sake.” Kiodex eventually recovered. Mr. Chavez sold it and retired to his house on Fire Island. He was 40 years old. In the first weeks of his early retirement, Mr. Cohn phoned Mr. Chavez and asked him to return to Goldman. To consider the offer, Mr. Chavez traveled to a Catholic monastery in New Mexico for contemplation. At a Recode event last fall, he recounted how, while he was on toilet duty, God spoke to him and told him to go back to Goldman. This is dicey territory for a Goldman partner. Mr. Blankfein was pilloried when he said, in 2009, that Goldman was “doing God’s work.” Mr. Chavez said recently that he regrets his reference to God at the event, but the incident conveys the earnest passion with which he speaks about Goldman. Mr. Chavez was back at Goldman when the financial crisis hit — at the center of the bank’s efforts to calculate and track its health during those stressful times. Goldman made it through with better results than most rivals. But that success itself caused problems when government investigations uncovered instances in which Goldman profited from the country’s economic pain.
business/dealbook,Mr. Chavez recalls friends and family asking: How can you work there? It was a message echoing across the world, with Wall Street under fire for driving the nation to the brink of disaster. Goldman began a charm offensive. The company hired a new public relations chief, Jake Siewert, who previously worked as a chief White House spokesman under Bill Clinton. Goldman also began advertising campaigns stressing its philanthropic work and the financing it provides for projects like a new basketball arena in Kentucky. The crisis gave Mr. Chavez an opening to adopt a more aggressive strategy in his day-to-day work. With Wall Street facing the prospect of declining revenue and rising costs, the company was receptive to his proposals to standardize and automate more of its trading operations. Part of the savings to Goldman came from job cuts, though the bank does not provide detailed numbers. He also pitched automation as a way to help Goldman comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform, which aimed, in part, to make trading more transparent and easier for regulators to track. In the summer of 2013, an incident illustrated the perils of the old ways of doing business and paved the way for Mr. Chavez’s elevation to chief information officer. Goldman’s options-trading desks had installed faulty software that caused sharp swings in the market and resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses. An internal investigation found that the group installing the software had not been in touch with other parts of the trading business.
business/dealbook,In the past, the elite trading-desk programmers — strategists, or “strats” in Goldman lingo — had been in a different division from the traditional I.T. department. Mr. Chavez gained control of both units and unified them, causing some consternation on both sides. The strats worried about being dumbed down, employees say, while the I.T. engineers worried about being marginalized. Mr. Chavez also began aggressively pushing projects like Symphony, a program begun as a way to allow Goldman employees to communicate. Under Mr. Chavez, however, it was spun off into an independent company that the broader banking industry is now collaborating on. One draw of the system is that it may provide at least a partial alternative to expensive Bloomberg terminals. Symphony is representative of Mr. Chavez’s larger strategy. He gave up the opportunity to develop the software internally and turn it into a source of revenue in order to create something that everyone in the industry might use, and that might allow Goldman to communicate with all of its clients better, even if it is not making money off Symphony itself. But the software, like other programs Mr. Chavez is pushing, faces major hurdles to its success. It still needs to win over investment firms — the biggest clients of the banks — and many of them are hesitant to use software that, they worry, might give the banks a way to snoop on their communications.
business/dealbook,Mr. Chavez’s efforts have also faced skepticism in the technology community, in no small part because of a prominent case in which the company accused a former employee and programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, of stealing Goldman’s software upon leaving the company. Mr. Aleynikov prevailed in court. And the case left the impression in the tech world — among some of the very programmers Goldman is now trying to recruit — that the bank would always value its bottom line over the ideals of Silicon Valley. Mr. Chavez was not involved in Mr. Aleynikov’s case. And he has been trying to confront Wall Street’s mixed reputation among programmers. He has gone to lead recruiting events at elite institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where the number of students applying to Wall Street has fallen sharply, in part because of the perception of the industry as stuffy and slow-moving. Mr. Chavez has not been shy about pushing the company to embrace social issues as a selling point. He urged its human resources department to expand benefits to gay partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. He then encouraged Mr. Blankfein to speak out in support of gay marriage. Still, he acknowledges, there is much to do. At the Recode event last fall, he joked about Goldman’s lack of diversity. He was in an office, he said, with a fellow Hispanic executive, when another executive stopped by. “He opens the door, he sticks his head in, and he says, ‘50 percent of the Hispanic partners of Goldman Sachs, right here, right now.’” The task now, he said, was to take Goldman “to a different place.”

world/africa,Fearing ‘Total Chaos’ in Libya, U.N. Plans New Peace Talks  - The New York Times GENEVA —  The United Nations said Wednesday that it was starting a new round of talks here aimed at ending the chaos and violence in Libya, as international concern grows over the widening influence of Muslim extremists there. The talks, aimed at reaching a political settlement, including a national unity government, are seen as a last chance to end months of fighting among rival militias that has plunged Libya into deepening insecurity and economic chaos and destabilized surrounding countries, Bernardino León, special representative of the secretary general and head of the United Nations Mission in Libya, said in Geneva. “It’s going to be a long process; it’s going to be difficult,” Mr. León said. “We are not expecting to have a breakthrough tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. There is a gap between the parties, which is becoming more complicated; there is more fighting on the ground.” Mr. León called for the talks after two months of consultations with a wide variety of groups, including the government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni, now based in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the rival Libya Dawn movement, which seized control of the capital, Tripoli, in August. Other participants in the talks include representatives of some militias and important municipalities, Mr. León said. Despite the lengthy preparations, some important political actors have not committed to the talks, though the door remains open, Mr. León said.
world/africa,Mr. León stressed the critical importance of reaching a settlement now. “There is military and security chaos in the country,” with new lines of conflict opening in recent weeks, a surge in terrorist activity in many areas and an economic crisis, he said. The abduction of 21 Egyptian Christians in recent days by militants associating themselves with the Islamic State underscored concern about the spread of Muslim extremist groups outside the main areas of conflict in Syria and Iraq. “The general impression is the country is very close to total chaos,” Mr. León said, warning that if this effort failed, it would be hard to imagine a situation that would allow another peace process to start. On top of the fighting by rival militias, Mr. León cited fears that Libya is heading for an economic crisis. Fighting in recent weeks has damaged key oil facilities, cutting exports, and falling oil prices have knocked a further hole in the only major source of revenue supporting Libya’s national budget. Libya’s militias have said they do not want to fight and instead want a political solution, Mr. León said, observing that although they had not announced a cease-fire, the fighting had eased in the last two or three days. “I would like to think that it is because we are having these talks, and both sides are trying to show good will,” he said.
world/africa,The first round of talks in Geneva will continue until Saturday, Mr. León said, adding that he hoped that after participants reported back to Tripoli, the discussions would resume early next week. “As early as next week, we would like to start talking to military actors in a conference setting,” he said.
arts/television,Revisiting ‘Deadwood,’ a Lawless Prelude to TV’s New Golden Age - The New York Times After watching the pilot episode of “Deadwood,” I got up, lowered the blinds, dimmed the lights and burned through the rest of the DVD in a fugue of wonder and excitement. I didn’t leave the series until the next day, staggering limply into the harsh sunlight like Ray Milland in “The Lost Weekend.” It was 2004, and I had been the chief television critic at The New York Times for about a year. HBO had sent me advance screeners of its new western. And I was discovering binge watching. There are dramas that are arguably better or more widely appreciated than “Deadwood”: “The Sopranos,” “The Wire” or “Breaking Bad.” But of all the shows I have reviewed over the past 12 years, “Deadwood” is the one I would most like to see again for the first time. In that first jolt of surprise and enthrallment, it felt as if David Milch had created “Deadwood” just for me — I’ve always loved westerns — twisting the genre to invent something new. I wrote at the time that westerns were like men’s clothes or formal poetry: There is a certain liberty in their constraints, and some limitations inspire creativity. “Deadwood” turned out to be a television sonnet with a hip-hop beat. Before “Mad Men” or “The Americans” found new ways to reclaim the past, this was a period piece ahead of its time, a modern drama set during the Dakota gold rush of the 1870s. A grim, washed-out palette of sepia and gray replaced the familiar Technicolor panoramas of John Ford westerns.
arts/television,This depiction of the West was sophisticated and deeply layered, sometimes comical but always brutal. Fetid, crowded, filthy Deadwood wasn’t just primitive — it was primal. Murdered men were fed to pigs. Sex in the brothels was almost as callous. The characters spoke a new language, too, an incongruous mix of poetry and profanity that hasn’t been matched by any other show, not even the first season of “True Detective.” Mr. Milch spiked the commonplace blasphemy of the 1870s with obscenities so crude they would make rappers flinch. But threaded through the spew of swear words would be sudden flights of near-Shakespearean eloquence. Comforting a slighted henchman, the town pimp and saloonkeeper, Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), was soothing: “Whatever lurks ahead, whatever grievous abominations and discord, you and me walk into it together, like always.” Fans of the show — and I was one of the first — fell in love with Swearengen, the murderous, devious and world-weary Old West mob boss. The show had a putative hero, Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), a former marshal turned shopkeeper, but Swearengen was the real star, a complicated, beguiling antihero high in the pantheon of the so-called difficult men of television’s second Golden Age. I was even more smitten with Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), the profane and drunken sidekick to Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) — both historical figures reimagined by Mr. Milch. Jane dressed, drank, cursed and fought like a man, but when she looked at Wild Bill, her face softened with a spinsterish yearning that was heartbreaking. Then someone else would speak up and she would snap back to her usual snarling, bullying self.
arts/television,Deadwood was lawless territory, which was interesting because Mr. Milch cut his teeth on “Hill Street Blues” and “NYPD Blue,” the kind of contemporary cop shows that eventually all but killed the TV western. It seemed fitting that he would pay reparations by riffing on frontier lawlessness and disorder. In a 2004 interview, he told the journalist Ned Martel that he wanted to explore the “primordial ooze” of law enforcement. In Deadwood, the closest thing to justice was revenge with peer review. Mr. Milch has a complicated history, and his next two shows for HBO, “John From Cincinnati” and the ill-fated “Luck,” were astonishingly flawed. But I admire his unsteadiness almost as much as I respect the more consistent brilliance of David Chase or Vince Gilligan. Mr. Milch’s ambitious, anarchic flops make the success of “Deadwood” all the more miraculous. The series reached the flash point of creativity, talent and audacity needed for truly great television. And, on reflection, “Deadwood” was more than than an exemplar of its era; it also served as a fitting metaphor for our time. Once the Internet took hold, TV turned almost as lawless as the Black Hills, a gold-rush medium of ruthless prospectors, few rules and infinite potential. But even “Deadwood” settled down and turned civic-minded by Season 2. Television may still be plagued by illegal streaming. But in the end, the Internet didn’t exterminate the networks, it just changed the way we watch their shows.
arts/television,I came to the critic’s job from the news side, and I spent my early days focused on television coverage of the Iraq war and the 2004 election. Reality TV was the other hot topic when I started, even if most of those shows — “The Osbournes,” “The Bachelor,” “Fear Factor” — were more fun to analyze as expressions of the national id than to watch. Lots of extraordinary things were already happening on television: “The Sopranos” was still on the air, and so was “The Wire.” Broadcast networks and HBO were the mainstays, with FX and Showtime learning to take risks. Then shows like “Damages,” “Homeland” and “The Americans” started breaking through, and suddenly we were in a new age of exploration. One pleasure of being a critic was navigating the global reach that Netflix and other streaming sites brought to American viewers; it was exhilarating to discover foreign shows like “Forbrydelsen,” “Borgen” and “Spiral.” When I asked for the job, some of my colleagues were surprised, and a few could barely disguise their contempt for the medium, asking me pityingly how I could bear to watch all that junk. Twelve years later, the same people excitedly lobby me on behalf of new shows they have discovered. (If anything, it’s now the film critics they pity.) “Deadwood” lasted for three seasons. But today those episodes are always within instant reach, on HBO Go and other places, and my viewing time, since I am leaving the beat, is now my own. Paradoxically, one of the rewards for not being a television critic is that you get to watch more television: Now I can stream “Deadwood” whenever I want, however I want.
sports,Oksana Masters’s Road From a Ukrainian Orphanage to Paralympic Stardom - The New York Times PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Twenty years ago, it would have been hard to imagine 8-year-old Oksana Masters — three feet tall, 35 pounds, no thumbs and misshapen legs — included in an NBC montage of the world’s best athletes, or having her face plastered on train station posters. But Masters, now 28, is expected to be one of the most visible and popular athletes at the Paralympic Games here this month. She is featured in commercials for Toyota and Proctor & Gamble that showcase her strength and resilience as that rare athlete who wins medals in both Winter and Summer Games. Her friend Mikaela Shiffrin, the superstar skier and Olympic gold medalist, recently posted an Instagram photo wishing her luck. Masters’s emergence as one of the bigger and better-compensated stars in U.S. Olympic sports illustrates how an athlete’s back-story — and the social and traditional media buzz it can generate — can be as important as what transpires on the field of play, or even the competition in which she is participating. And few athletes have a back-story as compelling and aspirational as Masters, who has already been featured in Sports Illustrated and posed nude for ESPN The Magazine. Masters’s agent Brant Feldman, who also represents other Olympic athletes who would kill for Masters’s sponsor portfolio, said she wants to show people that may look like her that they can still aspire to anything even if you don’t have legs. “These brands have allowed her to bring that message out there,” he said.
sports,At the games themselves, Masters, a double amputee and nordic skier, plans to enter as many as six events. It’s a remarkable load for any athlete. But it is one that Masters, a multisport athlete who also competed at the Paralympic Games in London (rowing), Sochi (cross-country skiing) and Rio (cycling), is more than equipped to handle. Born in Ukraine in 1989 with severe physical defects most likely related to radiation poisoning from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Masters was given up for adoption at birth. She spent her first seven and a half years in the country’s troubled orphanage system, where malnourishment and emotional and physical abuse were common. Children were bullied by older orphans, and exploited by adults. At age 6, she was given a photo of Gay Masters, a single American woman who wanted to adopt her. Oksana Masters clung to the picture and waited. It gave her hope. But a ban on Ukraine adoptions delayed her prospective mother for two years. “I was a troublemaker,” Oksana Masters says. “I got in a lot of trouble and never learned from that. If they hit me, I just laughed. It’s the one thing they can’t take from you. “They started saying, ‘Your mom’s not coming to get you, because you’re a bad girl.’ You start to believe it.” Masters doesn’t like to focus on the suffering she endured, but she has vivid memories of the night her mother rescued her. She wanted to stay up and wait for her new mother, who had again been delayed by paperwork in Kiev, but her caretakers forced her to go to bed.
sports,“I remember the hallway was super dark and dim-lit and smelled like mildew, and I remember sliding on the floor a little bit on the way to bed because the pipes were burst and water was leaking,” she recalls. “When they put you to bed, you’re laying on your back and they tuck the covers under you super tight so you can’t turn.” Then she felt a tap on her shoulder. Gay Masters was kneeling by her bed with a Ukrainian interpreter. “I said, ‘I know you. You’re my mom. I have your picture,’” Oksana Masters says. “I remember her smiling and her hand touching me. She said, ‘I know you. You’re my daughter.’” When she arrived to her new home in Buffalo, Masters was nearly 8 years old, undersized and emaciated. She soon gained weight, grew and adjusted to life in the U.S., but she faced a daunting set of medical issues. Masters was born with five webbed fingers on each hand, and no thumbs. Her left leg was six inches shorter than her right, and her legs lacked weight-bearing bones. She had endured multiple, and in some cases misguided, surgeries in Ukraine. Later, doctors would discover that she was missing some of her stomach, as well as parts of her arm muscles and ligaments. She was born without tooth enamel — at the orphanage she was held down as a tooth was pulled without anesthesia. She arrived in the United States with four abscessed teeth and a fear of the dentist.
sports,“Love is not the only answer,” says Gay Masters, a speech and language pathologist at the University of Louisville. “You have to really work hard to help them trust and grow. But she came with so much spunk, I just got out of her way." She recalls how her daughter once saw another child dangling from the top bar of a swing set. Oksana Masters wanted to do it, too, but with webbed hands and no thumbs, she couldn’t grasp the bar. “I put her down and said, ‘This is one of the things you need thumbs for,’” Gay Masters says. Ever-defiant, Oksana Masters later persuaded a babysitter to take her back to the swing set. “Within two weeks she could do it by herself,” her mother says. “Turns out, you don’t need thumbs to do that. That girl surprises me; she always has. She’s always done the impossible.” The challenges continued: surgeries to separate her webbed fingers and to create thumbs; the amputation of her shorter leg at age 9 and the other leg at 14, with the promise of improved mobility with prosthetic limbs; and a move to Louisville, to be closer to her grandfather. Oksana Masters struggled with adjusting to a new school, her new body and prosthetics, and the return of dark memories of the orphanage. Her mother pushed her to try sports, including a rowing group for children with disabilities.
sports,“As soon as she got into the water, she was so good,” her mother says. “Sports did save her life. She took all that anger, all that fear, and worked it out.” Oksana Masters stuck with the sport, progressing through the rowing circuit. In 2011 she partnered with Rob Jones, a Marine veteran who had lost both legs in a land mine explosion the previous year. Masters and Jones won the bronze medal at the 2012 London Paralympic Games, and she was hooked on international competition. But rowing was just the start. After London, Oksana met Eileen Carey, the head coach for U.S. Paralympic Nordic Skiing, who recruited her to try out for the Winter Games. She began training in Colorado, where she fell in love with both winter sports and Aaron Pike, an accomplished wheelchair track athlete at the University of Illinois-Champaign who had also been invited to the nordic training camp. “We started flirting and talking,” Masters says. “Next thing you know I’m asking if I can do laundry there. I had laundry where I was, I was just looking for reasons to come over.” The relationship moved slowly. Both competed for the U.S. Paralympic teams in Sochi, where Masters won silver and bronze in cross-country skiing, and in Rio de Janeiro — Masters in hand cycling and Pike in track. Now both have qualified for Pyeongchang in cross-country skiing and biathlon, and they train and live together in Bozeman, Mont.
sports,“I get more nervous watching her,” says Pike. “I hope she doesn’t fall, that she hits every shot. I’m less nervous starting my own race.” After having a single deal with KT Tape in Rio two years ago, Masters has recently won the support of major sponsors — including Toyota, Procter & Gamble, The Hartford, Visa, and Nike — easing a burden after years of financial struggles (she once slept in her car during a competition because she didn’t have the money for a hotel). Shiffrin, who met Masters during a commercial shoot for Visa in New Zealand, said she was an immediate fan. “She was so cool and down to earth and peppy and just seemed like she’s totally inspired on life,” Shiffrin said. “Then I heard about her story and was just dumbfounded by how much she’s had to overcome her entire life, but she’s the last person to hold a grudge. I take a lot of inspiration from that.” One more obstacle cropped up for Masters in the lead-up to her fourth Paralympics, in Pyeongchang, where she had been viewed as a top contender after winning four gold medals at the 2017 World Para Nordic Skiing World Championships. In late February, she slipped on a patch of ice in Bozeman, falling and dislocating her elbow. The injury was a significant setback — she may have to switch her shooting arm in the biathlon, and it’s unclear how fast she can propel herself on skis without full strength in her elbow. Undaunted, she plans to compete in the biathlon on Saturday and take part in six events during the games.
sports,“I’m not chasing medals,” Masters wrote in an Instagram post. “I’m chasing after my dream of representing my country, any young girl who was ever told she would be too small to be an athlete, anyone who was ever told it would be impossible to comeback from an injury and still compete at an Olympic and Paralympic Games.” When Shiffrin learned about Masters’ injury, she posted an Instagram photo of the two of them and was eager to offer support. “That’s a really big injury to have,” Shiffrin said. “But I have absolutely no doubt that she’s going to be able to blow everyone away with how she overcomes it and her mental toughness.” Masters said she plans to approach these games as she does every race. As she watches the clock tick down to the start, she will take a breath. “I say, ‘I am’ — I breathe out — ‘strong. I am strong.’ And then I just take off.”
world/asia,In Seoul, Kerry Warns North Korea Against Missile Test - The New York Times SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State John Kerry warned North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, on Friday not to proceed with a test launching of its Musudan missile, which he said would inflame “an already volatile, potentially dangerous situation.” But Mr. Kerry also stressed that the United States was open to negotiations with North Korea if it committed itself to eventual denuclearization. The Musudan missile has a range of up to 2,500 miles, according to American officials, which means it has the potential to strike targets in Japan, South Korea and even Guam. South Korean officials said earlier this week that North Korea had been making preparations to test the missile. There has been speculation that Mr. Kim will order the launching to commemorate the anniversary on Monday of the birth of Kim Il-sung, his grandfather and the founder of North Korea, or that it might be fired while Mr. Kerry is in the region. “If Kim Jong-un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community,” Mr. Kerry said at a news conference after meeting with President Park Geun-hye and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se of South Korea. “It’s not going to change our current position, which is very, very clear: we will defend our allies,” Mr. Kerry said.
world/asia,American officials have said that they have not detected efforts by the North Koreans to mobilize forces or make serious war preparations. And Mr. Kerry said the greatest risk would be a conflict that arose out of a series of miscalculations by North Korea, not a deliberate attack. Still, he underscored the risks. “Kim Jong-un needs to understand, as I think he probably does, what the outcome of the conflict would be,” Mr. Kerry said in a pointed reference to the United States and South Korean military capabilities. American officials say that the capabilities of North Korea’s Army have begun to erode because of equipment shortfalls and training deficiencies. But it has sought to compensate by fielding a large number of Special Operations forces, producing ballistic missiles and developing chemical arms and nuclear weapons, officials say. While the United States and South Korea have publicly said a launching would be a serious provocation, some American officials say it might also serve as a way for Mr. Kim to back away from a confrontation while saving face. “That might give Kim Jong-un some sort of off ramp,” said an American official who, following diplomatic protocol, spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity. “You could say, ‘I have stood up to the United States; I launched a missile.’ ” The American official said the United States had not seen any indications that a launching was imminent but noted that it could be carried out with little or no notice.
world/asia,Mr. Kerry is wrapping up a six-nation tour. With tensions running high on the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Kerry arrived in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Friday to reassure America’s ally and discuss United States-South Korea issues before Ms. Park comes to Washington next month to meet with President Obama. Though he has traveled to Asia for more than four decades, Mr. Kerry was visiting South Korea for the first time. Mr. Kerry noted that Mr. Obama had canceled some American military exercises to contain tensions in the region. Mr. Kerry also dispensed with one of the rituals of many visiting American dignitaries: a high-profile trip to the demilitarized zone between the North and the South. Besides stops in South Korea and Japan, Mr. Kerry will also visit China on Saturday to urge officials there to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Reiterating the longstanding American position, Mr. Kerry said the United States would never accept North Korea as a nuclear state. Talks involving the United States and North Korea, he said, can take place only if Mr. Kim agreed to move to denuclearization. “They simply have to be prepared to live up to their international obligations and standards, which they have accepted, and make it clear they will move to denuclearization as part of the talks, and those talks can begin,” Mr. Kerry said. “But they have to be really serious.” At the same time, a joint statement issued by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Yun endorsed Ms. Park’s efforts to establish a dialogue with North Korea.
world/asia,Under the previous South Korean leader, Lee Myung-bak, Washington and South Korea moved in lock step, keeping contacts with the North to a minimum and insisting on applying sanctions until North Korea would make serious steps toward denuclearization. Under Ms. Park, South Korea appears to have eased the stance. While South Korean officials said they wanted dialogue with North Korea to help explore ways of defusing the current crisis, they insisted they had no intention of compromising on the fundamental question of its nuclear program. “We will strongly retaliate against North Korean provocations, but if North Korea accepts change and joins us in dialogue, we will try to build mutual trust for co-prosperity,” Ms. Park told Mr. Kerry, according to an account provided by her office. As part of the trust-building effort, the South Korean government supported the provision of medicine to North Korea by nongovernmental groups. “Truly humanitarian aid and transparent aid,” Mr. Yun said, “is totally acceptable.” The disclosure on Thursday that the Defense Intelligence Agency had determined with “moderate confidence” that North Korea was capable of making a nuclear weapon small enough to be delivered by a ballistic missile was the subject of much attention here. Mr. Kerry said the United States did not believe that the North Koreans had such a “fully tested and available capability.” “Obviously, they have conducted a nuclear test, so there’s some kind of device,” Mr. Kerry added. “That is very different from miniaturization and delivery. Does it get you closer to the line that is more dangerous? Yes.”
world/europe,Migration Crisis Puts Europe’s Policy Missteps Into Focus, Experts Say - The New York Times CATANIA, Sicily —  To human rights advocates, one of Europe’s biggest mistakes in the Mediterranean migration crisis came last November with the shutdown of the Italian patrol and rescue program known as Mare Nostrum. Led by the Italian Navy, the program saved thousands of migrants at sea. But ending it, largely for budget reasons, had effects beyond scaling back humanitarian efforts. Even as the Italians were saving lives, they were using the program to identify and prosecute the smuggling networks behind the surge in human trafficking across the Mediterranean. The program helped Italian prosecutors convict more than 100 people for human smuggling and indict three smuggling bosses in Egypt. Italian ships patrolled international waters — making it possible to capture some smugglers in the act — while police investigators were stationed onboard. “Police were able to intervene directly,” said Giovanni Salvi, the chief prosecutor in Catania. “They could immediately identify the telephones that were being used, the numbers and the traffickers. We could get wiretaps. That allowed us to record conversations between the ‘mother ship’ and the bosses in Egypt.” The program that replaced Mare Nostrum, known as Triton and run by the European Union, is far less ambitious and restricted to the waters immediately off the European coast, and it does not include a robust law enforcement component. The decision by European leaders not to pick up the monthly bill of 9 million euros (about $9.8 million) to keep Mare Nostrum operating has drawn scathing criticism in the aftermath of last weekend’s deadly shipwreck, which left more than 750 migrants dead.
world/europe,European leaders this week effectively conceded their mistake and pledged to triple funding for search-and-rescue missions while also dedicating new resources to fighting the smuggling rings. But as the flow of migrants continues unabated, the new European response is being criticized as shortsighted and still lacking the scope of Mare Nostrum, which itself was never intended as a comprehensive solution. And Europe continues to struggle with how to apportion money and personnel among saving lives on the sea, prosecuting human smugglers and dealing with the causes of the migrant surge closer to their source in poor and war-torn regions of the Middle East and Africa. Many analysts, as well as United Nations officials, say Europe needs a more holistic response, including overhauling its asylum system and expanding channels of legal immigration, because the problem of illegal migration will only worsen. “There was a lot of expectation from the public that the European Union wasn’t going to give just a short-term response but a medium- and long-term vision,” said Thomas Huddleston, an analyst with the Migration Policy Group in Brussels. “We didn’t get that.” He added, “The real question is, What is the goal of this response?” In Sicily, where the brunt of the crisis is being felt, smuggling boats have continued to arrive, day and night. On Friday, Mr. Salvi heard testimony in a closed hearing against the Tunisian man accused of piloting the boat that capsized in the fatal shipwreck, as well as a Syrian man who is alleged to have been working as an accomplice.
world/europe,Mr. Salvi’s office, if more accustomed to pursuing cases against the Sicilian Mafia, now has a special team of prosecutors that works with the Italian police to confront the smugglers. Mare Nostrum, which is Latin for “our sea,” was hardly a cure-all, Mr. Salvi said, but it provided investigators with the advantage of scope and immediacy. On at least five occasions, Mare Nostrum ships working in international waters seized “mother ships” — the large vessels that carry out migrants before transferring them to smaller boats in international waters. Meanwhile, police investigations could start aboard rescue ships, as officers began questioning migrants, and identifying smugglers, as soon as people were rescued. By contrast, no police investigators were on the Italian Coast Guard ship that responded to the fatal shipwreck last weekend. Once the 28 survivors were rescued, Mr. Salvi sent a helicopter to the scene to retrieve a Bangladeshi survivor for questioning in Catania. In addition, investigators were airlifted to the coast guard ship as quickly as possible. “We lost some hours — it is very important for us, those first hours,” said Mr. Salvi, even as he stressed that Europe needed to stop addressing migration as an emergency. “We have to consider this a structural problem that will continue. We have to deal with this in a more comprehensive way.” In addition to tripling funding for the current Triton program, which is led by Europe’s border agency, Frontex, Europe is taking other steps to address the problem. Britain and Germany have pledged to contribute ships to participate in expanded patrolling.
world/europe,There is also discussion of trying to blockade Libyan ports or destroy smuggling boats before they are put to use — a proposal some analysts regard as fanciful. “The plan to destroy smugglers’ boats is highly dubious,” said Masood Karimipour, regional representative in Cairo for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. “There is no shortage of rickety fishing boats or rubber dinghies. These quick-fix tactics make for catchy headlines but are not effective and sustainable solutions.” He added, “You can’t shoot your way out of a humanitarian crisis.” The scope of smuggling operations in North Africa is immense and multifaceted, defying easy solutions, analysts say. Tuesday Reitano, a policy analyst who has studied North African smuggling networks, credited Italian prosecutors for going after smuggling bosses. But she warned that migrant smuggling had become hugely profitable, with different militias or African clans controlling pieces of territory. “For West Africa and the Sahel, this is the next cocaine flow,” said Ms. Reitano, who is the head of the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime’s secretariat, citing the illegal profits once made in the region’s drug trade. The economics shifted with the civil war in Syria because suddenly tens of thousands of affluent Syrians were willing to pay several thousand dollars, per person, for passage to Sweden or Germany. In response, Ms. Reitano said, loosely connected smuggling networks have coalesced, charging higher rates to Syrians, even as they are willing to take less from Africans, who are often overloaded onto small boats to bolster profits. “You had huge numbers of Syrians, and now, all of a sudden, there is a parallel exodus of Africans,” she said. “That is not an accident.”
world/europe,Italian officials began Mare Nostrum in October 2013, after a disastrous shipwreck near the Italian island of Lampedusa in which hundreds of migrants died within a few hundred yards of the shore. Naval and coast guard vessels and aircraft expanded their search zone beyond Italian waters and rescued more than 150,000 migrants at sea, while assisting in the arrest of 330 smugglers, the Italian Navy said. Political opponents of Mare Nostrum argued that the program served as a “pull” factor that attracted more migrants with the promise of being rescued. Opponents in Italy also opposed the monthly €9 million price tag and called for the European Union to foot the bill. European leaders refused. Instead, Frontex was put in charge, though its mandate does not call for search and rescue operations. The new Triton program involved fewer ships patrolling a much smaller region. Deaths at sea have already topped more than 1,700, a huge spike from the same period a year ago. Now it is unclear whether the Triton program, beyond getting more money, will also expand the territory it patrols. Mr. Huddleston, the analyst with the Migration Policy Group, described Mare Nostrum as a “game changer” because by undertaking the humanitarian mission, Italy forced the rest of Europe to confront the issue. And even as the rescues will continue at sea, many analysts warn that efforts to simply bottle up refugees and migrants in Africa — without providing them with legal channels to seek asylum — will also backfire.
world/europe,“If you block people in Africa, they will continue to die,” said Philippe Fargues, director of the Migration Policy Center in Florence, Italy. “Maybe not before our eyes, but they will die somewhere in Africa. It is pure hypocrisy.”
magazine,The Loyal Engineers Steering NASA’s Voyager Probes Across the Universe - The New York Times In the early spring of 1977, Larry Zottarelli, a 40-year-old computer engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, set out for Cape Canaveral, Fla., in his Toyota Corolla. A Los Angeles native, he had never ventured as far as Tijuana, but he had a per diem, and he liked to drive. Just east of Orlando, a causeway carried him over the Indian and Banana Rivers to a triangular spit of sand jutting into the Atlantic, where the Air Force keeps a base. His journey terminated at a cavernous military hangar. A fleet of JPL trucks made the trip under armored guard to the same destination. Their cargo was unwrapped inside the hangar high bay, a gleaming silo stocked with tool racks and ladder trucks. Engineers began to assemble the various pieces. Gradually, two identical spacecraft took shape. They were dubbed Voyager I and II, and their mission was to make the first color photographs and close-up measurements of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons. Then, if all went well, they might press onward — into uncharted territory. It took six months, working in shifts around the clock, for the NASA crew to reassemble and test the spacecraft. As the first launch date, Aug. 20, drew near, they folded the camera and instrument boom down against the spacecraft’s spindly body like a bird’s wing; gingerly they pushed it, satellite dish first, up inside a metal capsule hanging from the high bay ceiling. Once ‘‘mated,’’ the capsule and its cargo — a probe no bigger than a Volkswagen Beetle that, along with its twin, had nevertheless taken 1,500 engineers five years and more than $200 million to build — were towed to the launchpad.
magazine,By T-minus two hours, a select few engineers, too nervous to sit down, stood at computers outside the high bay, overseeing the spacecraft telemetry. Elsewhere in the hangar, scientists, NASA brass from Washington and several dozen ‘‘nonessential’’ engineers — Zottarelli among them — huddled around TV monitors. At T-minus 30 seconds, the spacecraft’s engines roared to life, and many of the nonessentials took off running out of the room and toward the exit — ‘‘seven, six, five.’’ They burst out into the morning. Shielding their eyes, they peered across a flat expanse at smoke billowing on the horizon. Slowly and silently, the capsule rose out of the cloud, its rockets trailing flames. In an instant, there came a terrific boom as the sound waves from blastoff hit the hangar like a gong, ringing it as the spacecraft disappeared. Two weeks later, after the second launch, everyone headed home. The show was over — both spacecraft were performing flawlessly — but behind the scenes, the mission, on a tight budget, lagged in hiring the more than 200 computer engineers needed to shepherd the spacecraft through a planetary encounter. Many of those on the flight team were fresh out of college, running the most sophisticated electronics systems in the world. They had barely had a chance to jell, when, in April 1978, not yet halfway to Jupiter, Voyager 1 experienced a problem. Its scan platform, where the cameras and instruments are mounted, got stuck.
magazine,As the engineers scrambled to figure out what they could do from more than 100 million miles away, someone forgot to send a weekly command to reset a timer on the other spacecraft. When it ran down without hearing from Earth, it triggered so-called fault-protection software, 600 lines of code that respond to malfunctions automatically. In this instance, fault protection assumed the radio receiver was broken and switched to the backup. On the mission-control monitors in a situation like this, the crawl of numbers reporting the status of the receivers would have turned crimson: a ‘‘red alarm.’’ Realizing their mistake, the engineers tried to stop the fault-protection routine, but the newly awakened backup receiver would not register their command. Helpless, they waited for the spacecraft to reason its way back to the original receiver; when it did, and the command went through normally, they were giddy with relief. They were still high-fiving when the working receiver shorted out like a blown fuse. Now it really was dead. Fortunately, the malfunctioning backup receiver was still drawing current. They guessed that its oscillator, which allows it to accept a wide range of frequencies, had quit, essentially shrinking the target for transmissions from Earth. Assuming a much narrower bandwidth, and manually subtracting the Doppler effect, they recalibrated their signal. It worked — but to this day, the same calculation must precede every command. The original receiver remains useless: one engineer’s simple oversight nearly doomed humankind’s lone visit to Uranus and Neptune. ‘‘You like to think you have checks and balances,’’ Chris Jones, JPL’s chief engineer, who designed Voyager’s fault protection, told me. ‘‘In reality, we all worry about being that person.’’
magazine,Today the Voyagers are 10 billion and 13 billion miles away, the farthest man-made objects from Earth. The 40th anniversary of their launch will be celebrated next month. We tend to think of space as vacant, but it is actually matter, created, as everything in the universe is, by the explosions of ancient stars. Within our planetary neighborhood, this ‘‘space’’ is made up of different particles than the space outside is, because of supersonic wind that blows out from the surface of our sun at a million miles per hour. The wind generates a bubble around our solar system called the heliosphere. Five years ago, Voyager 1 reached the boundary where the heliosphere gives way to interstellar space, a region as novel to us — and potentially relevant — as the Pacific was to Europeans 500 years ago. The data the probes are collecting are challenging fundamental physics and will provide clues to the biggest of questions: Why did our sun give birth to life only here? Where else, within our solar system or others, are we most likely to find evidence that we are not alone? The mission quite possibly represents the end of an era of space exploration in which the main goal is observation rather than commercialization. In internal memos, Trump-administration advisers have referred to NASA’s traditional contractors as ‘‘Old Space’’ and proposed refocusing its budget on supporting the growth of the private ‘‘New Space’’ industry, Politico reported in February. ‘‘Economic development of space’’ will begin in near-Earth orbit and on the moon, according to the president’s transition team, with ‘‘private lunar landers staking out de facto ‘property rights’ for Americans on the moon, by 2020.’’
magazine,All explorations demand sacrifices in exchange for uncertain outcomes. Some of those sacrifices are social: how many resources we collectively devote to a given pursuit of knowledge. But another portion is borne by the explorer alone, who used to be rewarded with adventure and fame if not fortune. For the foreseeable future, Voyager seems destined to remain in the running for the title of Mankind’s Greatest Journey, which might just make its nine flight-team engineers — most of whom have been with the mission since the Reagan administration — our greatest living explorers. They also may be the last people left on the planet who can operate the spacecraft’s onboard computers, which have 235,000 times less memory and 175,000 times less speed than a 16-gigabyte smartphone. And while it’s true that these pioneers haven’t gone anywhere themselves, they are arguably every bit as dauntless as more celebrated predecessors. Magellan never had to steer a vessel from the confines of a dun-colored rental office, let alone stay at the helm long enough to qualify for a senior discount at the McDonald’s next door. Their fluency in archaic programming languages will become only more crucial as the years go on, because even as the probes harvest priceless information from the cosmos, they are running out of fuel. (Decaying plutonium supplies their power.) By 2030 at the latest, they will not have enough juice left to run a single experiment. And even that best case comes with a major caveat: that the flight-team members forgo retirement to squeeze the most out of every last watt.
magazine,One of the greatest obstacles to planetary science has always been the human life span: Typically, for instance, a direct flight to Neptune would take about 30 years. But in the spring of 1965, Gary Flandro, a doctoral student at Caltech, noticed that all four outer planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — would align on the same side of the sun in the 1980s. If a spacecraft were launched in the mid- to late 1970s, it could use the gravity of the first body to slingshot to the second, and so on. Such a trajectory would add enough speed to shorten the total journey by almost two-thirds. What’s more, this orbital configuration would not appear again for 175 years. The Voyagers carried cameras and instruments for analyzing atmospheric temperatures, moon masses, gravitational and magnetic fields and radiation levels. Reaching Jupiter in 1979, they captured images of lightning in its cloud tops and astounded scientists — who had assumed all moons were as barren as our own — with pictures of eight active volcanoes on its satellite Io; Europa, another Jovian moon, was encased in a shell of water ice, cracked in places by what appeared to be the tides of an ocean below. The photographs revealed themselves on control-room monitors pixel by pixel, row by row. ‘‘I would be sitting in here at night sometimes when the Voyager mission was flying,’’ Esker Davis, project manager for the Saturn encounter, told David W. Swift, who published an oral history of the mission in 1997, after Davis’s death. ‘‘And my wife would call up and ask what I was doing. I said, ‘Just watching pictures come in, being the first person to see this picture.’ ’’
magazine,The mission would have ended there, but President Ronald Reagan bestowed an extension, possibly swayed by the real-time briefings hosted by Ed Stone, the project’s lead scientist, on the occasion of every planetary encounter. Hundreds of reporters, as well as politicians and celebrities, attended, packing into a cramped JPL auditorium for the debuts of Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989. The final flyby, of Neptune’s moon Triton, took place on a hot August night. Afterward, everyone celebrated with Champagne, cold cuts and drunken singing; on the JPL lawn, Chuck Berry performed ‘‘Johnny B. Goode,’’ one of the tracks included on gold-plated records of human sights and sounds attached to the spacecraft for any intelligent life that might find them. Then, gradually, the hallways grew quiet. Stone and his colleagues moved on to new projects while analyzing Voyager data part time; the flight team laid off 150 engineers (many of whom went on to staff subsequent missions). The probes’ new goal was to reach interstellar space. But though scientists had measured the speed of the solar wind that forms the heliosphere, the properties of the matter beyond it had never been analyzed. How much pressure it exerted on the bubble, and thus the size of the bubble, were a mystery. So, too, was how long — years? decades? — it might take a craft to escape it.
magazine,At the mission’s outset, the flight-team members were mischievous kids. They relieved stress with games and pranks: bowling in the hallway, using soda cans as pins; filling desk drawers with plastic bags of live goldfish; making scientists compete in disco-pose contests. Now, by 1990, they were older, with kids of their own. They had experienced the deaths of colleagues and watched others’ marriages falter as a result of long hours at the lab. With no planets to explore, they spent the decade doing routine spacecraft maintenance with a fraction of their bygone manpower. Six of the current nine engineers were on the team then. Sun Kang Matsumoto, who joined the mission in ’85, studied so diligently to master the new roles pressed upon her that her sons learned the spacecraft contours by osmosis. When her eldest was 8, he surprised her with a perfect Lego model; now in college, ‘‘he calls and asks, ‘How is Voyager?’ Like, ‘How is Grandma?’ ’’ Matsumoto says. The mission originally occupied three floors of Building 264 on the JPL campus, home to many of the lab’s highest-profile projects. But soon after Neptune, says Jefferson Hall, who joined the project in 1978, ‘‘we were booted out.’’ Their first move was into the former offices of a mainframe-computer company in Sierra Madre. In 2002, after more staff cuts, they moved to a rental suite in Altadena. NASA reviewed the mission to determine if it should be canceled altogether.
magazine,The scientists’ models, meanwhile, began to reveal subtle changes in the raw data. By late 2004, it was clear that Voyager 1’s magnetometer had detected an abrupt increase in the strength of the surrounding magnetic field, suggesting the probe had entered the outermost layer of the heliospheric bubble, the ‘‘heliosheath.’’ This is where the solar wind ions abruptly slow as they press outward against the surrounding interstellar matter and swerve to create a cometlike tail. A wind of interstellar ions flows around the outside of the bubble like water around the bow of a ship. Finally, on Aug. 25, 2012, the density of particles around the spacecraft precipitously increased, as though it had plunged from sky to sea. It had crossed the threshold of interstellar space. In 2016, the year he turned 80, Zottarelli, the flight team’s most experienced programmer, gave six months’ notice and spent the time training a successor. None of the other engineers, only one of whom is under 50, have a replacement in waiting in the event that they abdicate more suddenly. Unlike the astrophysicists who devise experiments for Voyager and who interpret the results, the core flight-team members don’t have the luxury of being able to work simultaneously on other missions. Over decades, the crew members who have remained have forgone promotions, the lure of nearby Silicon Valley and, more recently, retirement, to stay with the spacecraft. NASA funding, which peaked during the Apollo program in the 1960s, has dwindled, making it next to impossible to recruit young computer-science majors away from the likes of Google and Facebook.
magazine,Last autumn, I drove through the San Gabriel Valley to a squat concrete building beside Scott-Fox Puppy Preschool. Suzanne Dodd, 56, the mission’s project manager, answered the door. She wore red-framed glasses over sharp blue eyes, and her fair hair was cut short. She escorted me past the vestibule to a common room ringed by office doors. Hanging over the cubicle partitions in the center was a shingle that read ‘‘Mission Control.’’ ‘‘You can see where we are in the culture,’’ she said, with a mild sweep of her palm. Voyager was her first job. She pointed out a used microfiche reader that Tom Weeks, a hardware engineer and the self-described mission librarian, purchased on eBay to read old diagnostics reports. To conserve power on the spacecraft, the engineers must decide what to turn off when, and for how long — which means estimating how cold they can let each component get. (On Voyager 2, because of the broken oscillator, any change in temperature also tweaks the receiver frequency.) Turning the heaters off for a while is the safest way to get enough power to run the instruments, but the lower the overall wattage drops, the faster parts will freeze. One of the team’s most valuable insights so far: Spinning the wheels of an eight-track tape recorder — the spacecrafts’ only data-storage option — generates a bit of additional heat.
magazine,Enrique Medina, the power subsystem expert, was preparing to implement a ‘‘patch,’’ an update that would turn off a heater on Voyager 2 in order to run the gyroscope, roll the spacecraft and calibrate the magnetometer. Even though they simulate every patch with software, there is plenty of room for human error. Far more often, hardware fails for no evident reason. In 1998, Voyager 2 reacted to a command by going silent. For 64 hours straight, the flight team studied the specific instruction — consisting of 18 bits, or 1s and 0s — that preceded the blackout. Bits have been known to ‘‘flip’’ to the opposite value, changing the instruction the same way that swapping a single letter turns ‘‘cat’’ into ‘‘cut.’’ The question was: What instruction had they accidentally given and how could they undo it? At last, modeling the outcome of each possible bit, they discovered one that turned off the exciter, which generates the spacecraft’s radio signal; when they turned it back on, the transmissions resumed. A similar scare took place in 2010, when a bit involved in formatting telemetry flipped, turning the transmissions to gibberish. ‘‘A lot of our anomalies we’ve come up with workarounds for, and at the time we didn’t know why it happened,’’ Weeks explained. Dodd added, ‘‘The No. 1 rule with spacecraft is: Don’t change it if you don’t have to.’’
magazine,In the mission-control cubby, Medina, who is 68 and a grandfather of four, with a husky voice and a Tom Selleck mustache, rolled a chair over to two pairs of monitors labeled with construction-paper signs that read: ‘‘Voyager Mission Control Hardware, PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH.’’ He jiggled a mouse, and one of the screens woke to a stream of numbers and letters describing the health of Voyager 1. Because they have only four kilobytes of computer storage, the spacecraft transmit data 24/7, but the radio signals take 19 hours and 12 hours to reach Earth. The three antenna dishes big enough to register them are shared, so Voyager gets only four to six hours of reception time per spacecraft per day; outside these often odd windows, their data dissipate into the ether. Medina gestured to another computer in the corner that monitors the telemetry that comes in when the office is empty and, if it detects an anomaly, phones an on-call engineer: the Voyager Alarm Monitor Processor Including Remote Examination tool. ‘‘We call it Vampire,’’ Medina said, ‘‘because it works in the middle of the night.’’ In March 2014, after news broke that Voyager 1 had crossed into interstellar space, I spoke with Medina over the phone. ‘‘I would not leave my wife to go with Angelina Jolie, as exciting as that sounds,’’ he told me. ‘‘And I would not leave Voyager to go to the new Mars missions. I will not leave Voyager until it ceases to exist. Or until I cease to exist.’’
magazine,All the billions of stars in the universe, hosts to billions of planets, have a heliosphere. Understanding the properties of our own will help us interpret observations of those systems. Voyager 1 has shown that it blocks 75 percent of cosmic radiation, which at extreme levels is toxic to life as we know it. This is not a static number: Our sun is orbiting the galaxy at 125 miles per second; its interstellar environment — and thus the size and shape of its heliosphere — is constantly in flux. ‘‘If the pressure outside got high enough, and there are some areas in the Milky Way galaxy where it would be high enough, it could compress the heliosphere down to where in fact the boundary is almost to where we are. And that would change the radiation environment of the planets, which is important when you want to try to understand anything about the origin of life,’’ Ed Stone, the science-team leader, told me when I visited him at Caltech last fall. ‘‘Here on Earth, wherever there’s liquid water, whether it’s boiling water coming out of the vents or frozen water, there are microbes there. So life is remarkably robust where there’s water.’’
magazine,He went on: ‘‘I think that one of the biggest questions is, Can we find a spot here in the solar system where there’s microbial life? If there’s no microbial life anywhere else, that would be surprising, given here on Earth it appeared fairly quickly after the end of the bombardment,’’ an epic rain of asteroids some four billion years ago. ‘‘If one could ever find some evidence of it here in the solar system where we could get a sample, then one could look at the DNA. All life on Earth has a related DNA. Is that true for everywhere? Either answer would be amazing. Either there’s only one way that life evolves, or no, there’s more than one way.’’ In his office, Stone stood on tiptoe to lift an intricate model of Voyager from the top of a bookcase. At 81, he moves more stiffly than the Stone of NASA archival footage. Otherwise, he is remarkably unchanged. On a bulletin board behind his computer, he pins the latest graphs of the rate of charged particles that each spacecraft has detected. A drastic dip in low-energy ones is what convinced him that Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere, and he is eager for Voyager 2, which entered the heliosheath from a different angle in 2007, to see a comparable drop before it goes quiet.
magazine,‘‘When we started this, I realized we were on a mission of discovery,’’ he said. ‘‘I just had no idea how much discovery there was going to be. And I certainly had no idea that it would last as long as it has.’’ After we lose contact with them, the spacecraft will continue to orbit the galaxy for billions of years, never striking another star. ‘‘Space,’’ Stone said, ‘‘is really empty.’’ Astrophysicists who study the heliosphere wage a constant battle against apathy when it comes to invisible substances nearly 100 times farther away from us than the sun is. ‘‘I hear a lot of people saying, ‘So what?’ I try to explain: ‘It’s like your home,’ ’’ Merav Opher, a professor of astrophysics at Boston University and a member of the Voyager science team, told me. ‘‘You just found out the walls aren’t walls. They’re porous. I think it’s existential.’’ In 2006, Opher and Stone published a landmark paper in The Astrophysical Journal predicting that Voyager 2 would encounter the heliosphere boundary closer to the sun than its twin had, pointing to a startling contradiction: The heliosphere must be asymmetrical; it is not a ‘‘sphere’’ after all.
magazine,There is passionate disagreement about what its exact shape is. (The Voyager scientists argue over practically every scrap of data; a few holdouts insist that Voyager 1 has yet to reach interstellar space.) In 1961, Eugene Parker, the renowned astrophysicist who first predicted the existence of a heliosphere, hypothesized that it might look like a comet — compressed in front with a tail in back. Earlier this year, Tom Krimigis, the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and the principal investigator for Voyager’s Low-Energy Charged Particle Experiment, published a paper in Nature Astronomy showing that the heliosphere has a very short tail and ‘‘kind of moves through space like a clenched fist.’’ His instrument has also shown that cosmic rays — expected to flow toward the heliosphere uniformly from across interstellar space — actually move quite differently depending on their orientation to the interstellar magnetic field. ‘‘Every once in a while, a tsunami passes Voyager,’’ Krimigis told me, referring to these waves. ‘‘The galaxy was supposed to be a calm sea, and that’s not what we find.’’ Opher believes that the influence of the sun’s magnetic field may warp the heliosphere into the shape of a ‘‘croissant.’’ At its plump center, interstellar matter presses in closer than previously thought — which would mean we are less isolated from the rest of the galaxy than we believe.
magazine,Last Sept. 29, a Thursday, Larry Zottarelli awoke before 7, as he did most weekdays, and dressed quietly so as not to disturb his sleeping wife. He raked a comb through his silver hair, donned trifocals and a calculator watch and drove to the office. He brewed his first mug of coffee in the efficiency kitchen and carried it to his desk. He’d been on the job for 40 years; the next day would be his last. A printed-out email taped to his computer hutch had instructions for handing in his badge and parking pass and collecting his final paycheck. He had cleared out most of his belongings, except two gallon-size Ziploc bags, in which he had sealed the plastic arms of his office chair to protect them from disintegrating under the daily weight of his elbows. Sitting facing the door, backed by a windowless, conch-pink brick wall, he brought to mind a hermit crab wearing a seashell. Later that morning, when Zottarelli entered the conference room to attend his last daily flight-team briefing, his colleague Adans Ko, 58, was arranging takeout containers of dim sum on the table for a celebration. He threw an arm around his shoulders and said, ‘‘Larry is going to give me a kiss today!’’ Matsumoto, who was holding a camera, said, ‘‘O.K., look at me.’’ She was making a photo album for him. When the party broke up, I found Zottarelli’s replacement, Lu Yang, at her desk. I asked her if he had given her any specific advice. ‘‘Whatever the problem, you go there and solve it,’’ she said, and laughed.
magazine,In retirement, Zottarelli told me, he would like to see Florida again. He wonders how it has changed. In his garage is a 1954 Swallow Doretti, a fixer-upper. ‘‘It probably needs new brakes,’’ he said. I asked him if there was anywhere he liked to drive for fun. ‘‘No,’’ he replied. ‘‘Not anymore.’’ I had stopped by his office to say goodbye and ask him what he planned to do with his newfound freedom. I pictured him in the Doretti, flying down the Pacific Coast Highway, wind in his hair. But he seemed to be in no mood for talking. I wished him well and turned to go. Then he spoke. ‘‘I expect my second stroke will be on the 17th of November,’’ he said ruefully, gesturing toward his empty wall calendar. ‘‘Life expectancy is five to seven years at my age on retiring, so —’’ He paused. ‘‘That was humor, I guess. I’m not looking forward to being even older. Got no choice in the matter.’’ I asked if he ever found himself thinking about the billions of years that the Voyagers will circle the center of the galaxy, long after our sun has exploded, scattering more stardust throughout the universe. ‘‘Of course,’’ he said. ‘‘I was raised in the Roman Rite. I’m pretty much an atheist. But what is the meaning of life? It’s not Monty Python, O.K.?’’ Had he reached any conclusions about what it is? ‘‘Well, on Earth, yeah,’’ he said. ‘‘One species always prepares the way for the next generation — that’s all.’’
nyregion,On the Mainland, a Duty to Help Puerto Rico - The New York Times
science,Comet Data Clears Up Debate on Earth’s Water  - The New York Times One of the first scientific findings to emerge from close-up study of a comet has all but settled a question that planetary scientists have debated for decades. The new finding, from the European Space Agency’s mission to the little duck-shaped comet called  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, appears to eliminate the possibility that the water in Earth’s oceans came from melted comets. Water vapor streaming off the comet contains a higher fraction of “heavy hydrogen” than the water on Earth does, scientists reported on Wednesday. “That now probably rules out” comets as the primary source of terrestrial water, said Kathrin Altwegg, a scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland and the principal investigator for the Rosetta instrument that made the measurements. With comets unlikely, most astronomers now think Earth’s water came from asteroids. The new findings, published in the journal Science, came after Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P in August, close enough for the instrument to begin detailed analysis of the molecules coming off the comet. Earlier, the same instrument discovered that the comet exuded the scents of formaldehyde and rotten eggs. “It’s a nice start to this phase of the mission,” Matt Taylor, the project scientist, said of the water findings. With Earth’s water a puzzle, scientists had long presumed that the planet was dry when it formed 4.5 billion years ago, and that the water came later, perhaps during the “late heavy bombardment” period more than 3.8 billion years ago. Comets, often called dirty snowballs, seemed a likely candidate.
science,Comets originate from two places in the solar system: the Kuiper belt, a ring of icy debris just beyond the orbit of Neptune; and the Oort cloud, a spherical shell of frozen detritus much farther out. Asteroids are rocky bodies in the inner solar system, mostly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. But comets’ water turned out to be different from Earth’s. A few water molecules have a heavier version of hydrogen called deuterium that replaces one of the two hydrogen atoms, forming what is known as heavy water. On Earth, about one in 6,000 water molecules contains deuterium. Oort cloud comets, it turns out, have twice the concentration of heavy water found in Earth water. Thus, when the Rosetta spacecraft was launched in 2004, most planetary scientists had already crossed comets off the list of possibilities. But in 2011, a team using the Herschel Space Observatory, an infrared telescope operated by the European Space Agency, took a look at water vapor from the comet Hartley 2 and found that its deuterium signal perfectly matched Earth’s water. That opened the possibility that Earth’s water could have come from Kuiper belt comets or those even closer, like Hartley 2, whose orbit does not go much farther out than Jupiter’s. “A lot of people thought that meant comets were back in play,” said Conel Alexander, a scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington.
science,The new measurements of 67P, another Jupiter-family comet, appear to rule out comets again. Its fraction of heavy water is three times that of Earth, higher than those of the Oort cloud comets. “Ten years ago I would not have been surprised at all by this result, because that’s what I expected,” Dr. Altwegg said. “But then three years ago we got this Hartley 2 measurement, and that was a real big surprise. Now we’re back to what I actually expected.” Much of the solar system’s water, including up to half of Earth’s, appears to predate the solar system, formed within expanses of interstellar space billions of years ago. The sun, like the universe over all, has very low levels of deuterium, about one-tenth as much as what is found in Earth’s water. However, under certain conditions — cold temperatures along with radiation that knocks electrons from hydrogen — chemical reactions create water molecules with a much higher fraction of deuterium. In a paper published in Science in September, scientists led by L. Ilsedore Cleeves, a graduate student at the University of Michigan, found that these conditions did not exist in the early solar system, so the high-deuterium water must have been present in the cloud of matter that collapsed to form the solar system. While the outer solar system was cold enough, the radiation was lacking. “Our paper showed that the outer part of the disk cannot be an engine for creating the deuterium fingerprint,” said Edwin A. Bergin, a professor of astronomy at Michigan who was another of the paper’s authors.
science,Recent studies on meteorites — pieces of asteroids that fell to Earth — paint a very different history of water. Scientists had thought the newborn Earth was dry, because it formed within the solar system’s “snow line,” where the temperatures are too warm for water ice to exist in the vacuum of space. In 2012, Dr. Alexander of the Carnegie Institution and his colleagues published a Science paper finding that some types of meteorites, in particular a class of primitive ones that formed beyond the snow line, have deuterium levels similar to Earth’s. In October, in another Science paper, researchers found that meteorites that originated from the large asteroid Vesta, which is believed to have formed inside of the snow line, also possess Earthlike deuterium levels. These scientists believe that ice-rich asteroids from outside the snow line were pushed inward and were among the pieces that combined to form Vesta and Earth hundreds of millions of years before the late heavy bombardment. In other words, Earth may have been wet from almost the beginning.
arts/music,Review: On ‘Malibu’ Anderson .Paak Takes In All That His Surroundings Offer - The New York Times “Malibu” (OBE/Steel Wool/Art Club/Empire) Often, when musicians revisit their cities’ pasts, they remain faithful to — hamstrung by? — one particular idea, characteristic or approach. But a thousand styles are flourishing in and around Los Angeles now, ones that are clearly indebted to the city’s past, from slung-low funk to ambitious jazz to tense hip-hop to perceptive soul. Anderson .Paak, a singer-rapper from Oxnard, Calif., is an amalgamation of what he hears around him, which, in turn, is an amalgamation of the last three decades of black music in Southern California. Where his peers — everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Kamasi Washington to YG to Madlib to Dr. Dre and beyond — have approached Los Angeles revivalism with narrow focus, he is an omnivore. Because of that, “Malibu” — his second album under this moniker, following a stretch under the name Breezy Lovejoy — is multilayered. It’s also incisive, languorous and deeply felt, a warm bath of studiously relaxed hip-hop and soul. His voice is scratchy with a soft undertone, and at times it recalls that of Mr. Lamar. But while Mr. Lamar raps with ferocity, Anderson .Paak opts for ease. The two share a conceptual approach, though — microscopic detail about personal frailty. It’s there on “The Season/Carry Me,” and on “The Bird,” with its sleepy trumpet. When Anderson .Paak slides from rapping to singing, he prefers the rhythmic approach held high by D’Angelo in the mid-1990s, sliding from word to word, with regular hard drops into the pocket.
arts/music,That “Malibu” so effectively combines these approaches is a testament to his versatility, but also to the album’s production, a slow, slithery mélange of soft-thump hip-hop and spacey soul. It’s a better match for him than the literalist Los Angeles update Dr. Dre delivered on his 2015 comeback album, “Compton” (Aftermath/Interscope), on which Anderson .Paak was heavily featured, a sort of Greek chorus of modern-day Los Angeles talking back to an old innovator. “Malibu,” though, lets him write his own version of the region’s sound, and in places on this album, as on “Celebrate,” he waxes rhapsodic about the city itself. Southern California has given Anderson .Paak many muses, and he’s letting them all talk to one another.
sports/tennis,Maria Sharapova Is Suspended From Tennis for Two Years - The New York Times Maria Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion and one of the world’s highest-paid female athletes, was suspended for two years Wednesday when an International Tennis Federation tribunal ruled that she unintentionally committed a doping violation. Sharapova announced in March that she tested positive for meldonium on Jan. 26 at the Australian Open and began serving a provisional suspension. Meldonium, a heart medication that is said to improve blood flow and allow athletes to recover faster, was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list on Jan. 1 after the agency monitored its use for a year. Sharapova, 29, said she had been taking Mildronate, whose active ingredient is meldonium, since 2006 to help manage a variety of health problems and was not aware that the drug had been banned. After a hearing May 18 and 19, a three-member tribunal appointed by the I.T.F. ruled that while Sharapova’s doping violation was not intentional, “she does bear sole responsibility for the contravention, and very significant fault, in failing to take any steps to check whether the continued use of this medicine was permissible.” Sharapova faced a suspension of up to four years if the tribunal decided her doping violation was intentional. Because of her prompt admission of her violation, the I.T.F. said, the suspension will be backdated to begin on Jan. 26, and she will be eligible to return at midnight on Jan. 25, 2018.
sports/tennis,Sharapova is the highest-profile tennis player to have a positive doping test. She said in a statement released on her Facebook page that she would appeal the suspension through the Court of Arbitration for Sport. “I cannot accept an unfairly harsh two-year suspension,” she said. “The tribunal, whose members were selected by the I.T.F., agreed that I did not do anything intentionally wrong, yet they seek to keep me from playing tennis for two years.” A four-year suspension could have been career ending, but if her ban is upheld, Sharapova, who has missed long periods on the tour because of injuries and has seen her ranking fall to No. 26, would be 30 when she returned to a sport in which Serena Williams and Roger Federer remain top players in their mid-30s. A lengthy doping suspension could harm Sharapova’s well-known brand, but she received support Wednesday from Nike, which along with other sponsors had suspended its relationship with her after the positive doping test was revealed in March. “The I.T.F. tribunal has found that Maria did not intentionally break its rules,” the company said in a statement. “Maria has always made her position clear, has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban. Based on the decision of the I.T.F. and their factual findings, we hope to see Maria back on court and will continue to partner with her.”
sports/tennis,The Court of Arbitration for Sport has been sympathetic to tennis players in recent appeals. In 2013, the court reduced Viktor Troicki’s 18-month ban for refusing to submit a blood sample to 12 months and cut Marin Cilic’s nine-month ban for unknowingly ingesting a banned stimulant to four months. “We always viewed this as a two-step process, I.T.F. first, then C.A.S,” John Haggerty, Sharapova’s lawyer, said in an email. Haggerty said he believed the I.T.F. wanted to make an example out of Sharapova because she is a famous athlete and to send a message that the federation was tough on doping. “I believe that at C.A.S.,” he added, “which is made up of an arbitrator selected by Maria, one selected by the I.T.F. and a neutral arbitrator selected by C.A.S., Maria’s suspension will be reduced and she will return to tennis sooner.” Sharapova and her representatives have said that her long-term use of Mildronate was to protect her health, not enhance her performance. Since January, more than 300 athletes, many from Russia and other Eastern European countries, have tested positive for meldonium, which is not approved for sale in the United States or the European Union but is sold over the counter in Russia and some other Eastern European countries. The Russian sports ministry, in particular, has been critical of the way the World Anti-Doping Agency handled banning meldonium, arguing that the drug was not performance enhancing.
sports/tennis,Last month, the Russian sports ministry said that most of its athletes had been reinstated after WADA issued new guidelines on the length of time meldonium takes to leave the body, and athletes were able to prove their positive tests had resulted from using the drug before it was banned. Such leniency was not available to Sharapova, who used meldonium after Jan. 1. The tribunal’s report on the case said Sharapova admitted taking 500 milligrams of Mildronate before each of her five matches at the Australian Open, where she lost to Williams in the quarterfinals. The report also disclosed that meldonium was found in an out-of-competition test in Moscow on Feb. 2. The report detailed Sharapova’s history using the drug, which dated to 2006, when she was 18. Mildronate was among 18 medications and supplements recommended by a Moscow doctor, Anatoly Skalny, to help Sharapova manage frequent illnesses by boosting her immune system. None of the medications were on WADA’s prohibited list at the time. Sharapova worked with Skalny through 2012 and, according to the report, he regularly checked the WADA prohibited list to assure the compliance of his recommendations, which at one point grew to 30 substances. But Sharapova, overwhelmed by the number of pills, changed her approach to nutrition in early 2013 and continued to use only three medications: Magnerot, Riboxin and Mildronate, which she believed would protect her heart and manage her magnesium deficiency, the report said.
sports/tennis,Since 2013, the report said, the only members of Sharapova’s team who knew she was taking meldonium regularly were her father, Yuri, and her agent, Max Eisenbud. Sharapova also did not disclose the use of the Mildronate or meldonium on any doping control forms since 2014, saying that she thought it was necessary only for substances she took daily. “I did not feel it was a responsibility to have to write down every single match drink I was taking, gel, vitamin I was taking, even if I took it once during the last seven days,” she is quoted as saying in the tribunal’s report. “I did not think it was of high importance.” The report called her failure to disclose her use of meldonium to antidoping authorities, her doctors, her coach, her trainer, her nutritionist or any other member of her team “a very serious breach of her duty to comply with the rules.” “This was a deliberate decision, not a mistake,” the ruling said. Haggerty said that players were not required to list everything they were taking. “For 10 years Mildronate was not on the prohibited list, so Maria had no reason to hide her use of it,” he said. The report repeatedly rejected Sharapova’s argument that the I.T.F. failed to sufficiently warn her that Mildronate had been added to the banned list.
sports/tennis,WADA published its prohibited list for 2016 on Sept. 29. A summary of the changes to the list was posted on the I.T.F. website on Dec. 7. The WTA and I.T.F. sent subsequent emails in December that included links to the antidoping program, but, Sharapova argued, they did not mention changes to the prohibited list. The federation also issued a wallet card that lists prohibited substances and gave one to Sharapova’s coach, Sven Groeneveld, in January, the report said. The report said that it was relevant to consider that Sharapova had used meldonium for 10 years before it was prohibited, but “she had a continuing duty to review the Prohibited List each year and from at least 2013 onwards did not take any steps to do so.” Eisenbud, a top agent for IMG, took the blame for what he called “an administrative error” of not alerting Sharapova to meldonium’s changed status. The tribunal found his reasons for failing to check the banned list even more dubious than Sharapova’s. Eisenbud said he had a routine of checking updates to the WADA prohibited list during his annual family vacation in the Caribbean in November, but the trip was canceled last year because of his separation from his wife. The tribunal asked “why it was necessary to take a file to the Caribbean to read by the pool when one email could have provided the answer.”
sports/tennis,The report put the responsibility squarely on Sharapova, saying if she had been more open about her use of meldonium, this situation could have been avoided. The tribunal, while confirming that she did not knowingly commit a doping violation, found “moral fault” in her conduct. “It may be that she genuinely believed that Mildronate had some general beneficial effect on her heath, but the manner in which the medication was taken, its concealment from the antidoping authorities, her failure to disclose it even to her own team and the lack of any medical justification must inevitably lead to the conclusion that she took Mildronate for the purpose of enhancing performance,” the report said. The tribunal conceded, though, that if Sharapova — or anyone on her team — had known that Mildronate was banned, she would have stopped taking it. The report concludes, “She is the sole author of her own misfortune.”
arts/dance,Sattriya, Kathak and Bharatanatyam Dance at Drive East - The New York Times The subtitle of the rich recent Drive East festival at La MaMa was “A Journey Through South Asian Music and Dance.” The word “journey” was just right: The range covered different geographical parts of India, different dance and music styles, different aspects of spirit and technique. I caught 18 performances: nine of music, nine of dance, most an hour long. The music events included examples of Hindustani (northern) and Carnatic (southern) music; recitals led by violin, veena, bansuri, solo voice and choir. I’m especially sorry to have missed the Sufi songs. There are eight dance genres generally listed as India’s classical dance forms; six were represented here. I caught five, one of which — Sattriya — was new to me. I’m by no means sure, however, how well it was exemplified here. Sattriya comes from Assam, the northeast state geographically separated from most of India by Bangladesh and Bhutan like an eastern peninsula. Like another of the eight classical styles, Manipuri (from the neighboring state of Manipur), Sattriya looks Indian even while suggesting several different cultural qualities and different rhythms. But is it as guarded and polite as the three women of the Sattriya Dance Company (based in Philadelphia) made it look? Their final number on Saturday was about the Brahmaputra River, which is central to Assam; but the vocal and orchestral sound seemed awkwardly like Europop.
arts/dance,The festival’s dances were — for economic reasons — almost all to taped music, but most soloists and companies made as much a virtue of this as possible. You could feel how precise — and often how complex — the musicality of the various idioms is. Only with the Sattriya troupe and Satya Pradeep’s Kuchipudi on Saturday were there even passing moments of musical imprecision; these were the festival’s least assured performances. The northern form Kathak depends more than any other on live interplay with music, and yet on Thursday, the brilliant virtuosity and bewitching charm of Barkha Patel helped us forget that tape must be second best. Likewise, the Bharatanatyam stylist Dakshina Vaidyanathan enchanted on Friday. Both are women of striking facial beauty, but what made this lovelier was the artistry with which they used their faces. Eyes, lips, cheeks, eyebrows, jaw all played their part; others present joined me in wishing that half of New York’s ballet dancers would study with them. In Ms. Patel’s case, the changing composure of her features made a wonderful contrast to the rapidity and skill of her turns and footwork. The two-tier dress she wore over leggings created gorgeous swirls of orange and gold. In her final number, she made a superlative impression, after a series of fast turns to the left, by making another series to the right, and thereafter alternating — and then suddenly she’d stop, and you’d hang on nothing but her face. The turn of her head over a shoulder, the opening of her eyes, the proud calm of her smile: ravishing.
arts/dance,Ms. Vaidyanathan showed the beauty and expressiveness of Bharatanatyam in terms of full-stretched line, gesture and rhythm. But there were times when her face itself — mobile, sensuous, possessed of changing characters and emotion, and supremely capable too of glorious repose — became the show. Yet the festival’s most revelatory dance recital came in the one that used live music throughout: Simran Godhwani’s performance on Friday. She and Ms. Patel have both studied with, and perform dances composed by, the celebrated Kathak master Birju Maharaj (who, at 76, will appear in September at the Kennedy Center in Washington). What she and her tabla accompanist,  Murari Sharan Gupta, did was to take us into the bewildering intricacies of Kathak rhythm. Both speaking with great charm, they soon had the audience calling out counts up to 16: simple — until he started to syncopate around that framework with a rhythmic complexity that left most of us giddy, whereupon she would match his drumming with the patterns of her feet (as rapid as in tap), arms and turns. You couldn’t tell it was a 16 even though you were counting it aloud yourself. And Ms. Godhwani showed how a dancer could begin at any count between one and 16; the point was always to end on a one, with stop-on-a-dime excitement. Kathak is, among other things, great fun even when you have no notion of its meter. When you do, the fun quotient climbs.
arts/dance,Subsequent counts of 14, 16 (fast this time) and 10 were altogether more bewildering, but Ms. Godhwani and Mr. Gupta kept drawing us in, illustrating the way Kathak may highlight three, five or seven successive beats in the middle of a much longer sequence. They showed other aspects of Kathak. For all its speed and metric complication, it’s highly elegant. Its moments of stillness (always so crucial to South Asian dance) matter as much as those of motion, and it’s dramatically communicative. The mazes of Indian rhythm were a marvel throughout the Drive East season. In some concerts, you could at times pick up slow counts of eight, divided into two and six, but the players or vocalists would seem free of that framework as they embellished and syncopated. When the young bansuri (flute) player J. A. Jayanth said on Saturday that one of his numbers used a rhythm of four, I made the mistake of breathing in relief, thinking I could at least follow that. Then he played a spellbinding bravura number in which I gave up all hope of ever discerning a rhythmic pattern. But rhythm always mattered, thrillingly. It’s marvelous to be sensuously lost amid an unfamiliar sound world and yet to sense its architecture.
us/politics,Obama Administration Optimistic About Health Plan Goal - The New York Times WASHINGTON —  The Obama administration said Thursday that 11.3 million people had signed up for health insurance so far during the Affordable Care Act’s third open enrollment period, with indications of a strong desire for coverage among young adults and others who were not enrolled last year. “We’re seeing unprecedented demand for marketplace coverage,” said Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, who released the data just hours after the Republican-controlled Congress cleared legislation to repeal the health care law. About 8.6 million people have signed up or been automatically re-enrolled in the 38 states that use HealthCare.gov, the website for the federal insurance marketplace, federal officials said. In states running their own exchanges, 2.7 million people have signed up. The current open enrollment period ends Jan. 31. Many people who select health plans later fall off the rolls because they fail to pay their share of premiums or find other coverage. With three weeks left, the administration appears to be on course to meet its goal of having 10 million people enrolled at the end of this year. Of 11.3 million people who had selected health plans, about 3 million, or 26.5 percent, were 18 to 34, the group most sought by insurance companies. That is similar to the 28 percent share reported at the end of open enrollment in 2014 and 2015.
us/politics,Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal marketplace, said that in the days remaining before the Jan. 31 deadline, he expected to see “a rush of younger people, who are much more procrastinators.” Still, the final tally of young adults seems most likely to fall below the 35 percent level that Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, said was considered “a good optimal number” when he ran the state insurance exchange in Connecticut. Many insurers would like to see a larger proportion of young adults, whose premiums help defray the costs of care for older, less healthy consumers. Supporters and opponents of the Affordable Care Act appear to be looking at different laws. As administration officials were announcing the new figures, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin was officially signing repeal legislation to be sent to President Obama for his promised veto. Mr. Ryan declared that the law would collapse under its own weight or be repealed with the help of a Republican president. “We are confronting the president with the hard, honest truth,” he said. “Obamacare does not work. It has to go. Higher premiums, fewer choices, restricted access — these are not signs of success. These are signs of failure.” Administration officials said they were pleased to see substantial numbers of new consumers shopping for insurance this year, and Mr. Counihan said that the higher penalties for going without insurance appeared to be “a very strong motivator for people to enroll.”
us/politics,New consumers accounted for 29 percent of people selecting health plans in the federal marketplace, but only 19 percent in the state insurance exchanges. Officials said they did not know how many of the 11.3 million people signing up in the federal and state marketplaces were previously uninsured. More than eight out of 10 people obtaining insurance in the exchanges qualified for federal subsidies to help pay their premiums. A report by the administration portrays marketplace consumers as savvy shoppers, much more likely than people with employer-sponsored insurance to switch to a different health plan. More than 3.6 million people who had coverage in 2015 returned to the federal exchange and actively selected a plan for 2016, rather than being automatically re-enrolled. About 60 percent of this group — 2.2 million people — enrolled in a different plan for 2016. Two factors may help explain these choices. Consumers in the federal and state marketplaces are keenly attentive to prices, and they may have to shift to new plans to avoid big increases in the premiums. In addition, the Obama administration has created online tools that make it easier for consumers to compare their total out-of-pocket costs under different health plans. The administration has made some progress in signing up Latinos, but still appears to be struggling to enroll African-Americans. Among people choosing health plans for whom racial and ethnic information was available, 14 percent were Latinos and 11 percent were African-American, the administration said.
us/politics,In each of three states, more than a million people have signed up for coverage through an insurance marketplace, and together they account for more than one-third of all sign-ups. Florida, with nearly 1.6 million people selecting health plans, and Texas, with 1.1 million, use the federal marketplace. California, with 1.4 million, operates its own exchange.
world/asia,Vietnam, Yielding to Beijing, Backs Off South China Sea Drilling - The New York Times HONG KONG — Vietnam appears to have retreated in a high-stakes maritime gambit against China, suspending a gas-drilling project that it had approved in the South China Sea but that was said to have irritated Beijing. The drilling, by a subsidiary of the Spanish energy company Repsol, had started in June off the southern Vietnamese coast, analysts said. The offshore block where the drilling was occurring straddles the border of Vietnam’s 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone but is challenged by China, Vietnam’s hulking northern neighbor, which is building artificial islands in the sea for its military. Analysts say the project’s suspension, which Repsol confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday, appears to be another strategic victory for China at a time when the Trump administration is distracted by turmoil at home. They say it also highlights the difficulty that Vietnam faces as it mounts long-shot challenges to Beijing’s claims to the South China Sea — without much help from its neighbors in Southeast Asia or from Washington. Vietnam’s leaders “can try their best to deter the Chinese” in the South China Sea, said Gregory B. Poling, a fellow in the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “But when the Chinese push back hard, like they just did, the Vietnamese are out on a limb all by themselves.”
world/asia,In an emailed response to questions about the Repsol project and Vietnam’s strategic priorities in the South China Sea, Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry, said the country supported the settlement of any disputes in the sea by peaceful means and according to international law. “Vietnam calls on relevant parties to respect the legitimate rights and interests of Vietnam and make positive and practical contributions to peace and cooperation in the East Sea,” she said, using the Vietnamese term for the South China Sea. Repsol did not respond to a request for comment. Unlike the Philippines and Japan, Vietnam is not a treaty ally of the United States, meaning Washington is not legally obligated to protect it in the event of an attack. Mr. Poling said that Hanoi found itself isolated on South China Sea policy in part because it was unsure how the Trump administration would react if a conflict escalated there. “I think it’s fair to say the Vietnamese are still not entirely confident” that the administration cares about the South China Sea in the way that the Obama administration did, he said. Vietnam’s strategic isolation has worsened as the Philippines, another major territorial claimant in the South China Sea, has warmed to China since President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in June 2016. Last July, the Philippines won a landmark case when an international tribunal ruled that Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over most of the sea had no legal basis. Vietnam saw the ruling as a giant step toward its decades-long goal of creating a unified diplomatic front against Chinese territorial encroachment in the South China Sea.
world/asia,But Mr. Duterte appeared to undercut the victory last year by saying that he favored direct talks with China over territorial disputes. Eufracia Taylor, a political analyst based in Singapore at the British risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said that while Vietnam and the Philippines were once “in the same boat” on South China Sea policy under Mr. Duterte’s predecessor, President Benigno S. Aquino III, bilateral relations had deteriorated since Mr. Duterte took office. It hardly helps that other Southeast Asian countries, which have less of a direct stake in South China Sea disputes and are mostly eager to woo state-backed Chinese investment, are reluctant to discuss Beijing’s island building or the arbitration ruling publicly, said Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “This is not surprising, because Asean would not want to spoil the atmosphere” as it tries to negotiate with China about establishing a so-called code of conduct in the sea, he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Vietnam’s South China Sea strategy may also be constrained by domestic concerns. When a state-owned Chinese company defiantly towed an oil rig into disputed waters near the Vietnamese coast in 2014, it provoked a tense maritime standoff as well as anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam that destroyed foreign-invested factories and led to the deaths of a few Chinese workers.
world/asia,Analysts say Vietnam’s top leaders worry that another such standoff could again inflame a lingering popular sentiment that the ruling Communist Party is not standing up to China, and therefore damage its legitimacy in the eyes of the country’s 93 million people. Alexander L. Vuving, a Vietnam specialist at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii, said that concern appeared to explain why Vietnam did not publicize the Spanish drilling project. “This time they were more aware of the threat from the inside, from their own population,” he said. Then there are naval considerations. Dr. Vuving said that Vietnam may have ordered Repsol to stop drilling in the South China Sea this summer because it feared its Coast Guard could be overwhelmed by a potential riposte from the Chinese Navy. By Dr. Vuving’s calculations, Vietnam roughly doubled the size of its Coast Guard, in terms of tonnage, from 2013 to 2017. That buildup has been widely seen as a response to the 2014 crisis, in which large Chinese Coast Guard vessels encircled wooden Vietnamese fishing boats near the controversial oil rig, embarrassing Hanoi. Analysts and defense officials said in interviews that Vietnam was also investing in maritime surveillance capabilities, conducting limited reclamation work on islands that its military controlled in the South China Sea and training crews to operate its six new Russian-built attack submarines. Mr. Poling said Vietnam’s overall aim was to deter Chinese aggression in the sea by developing the ability to at least give China a “bloody nose” in a hypothetical military conflict.
world/asia,“Vietnam’s building up its naval power in order to efficiently and effectively protect its sovereignty and defend its security” against China, said Nguyen Hung Cuong, a South China Sea expert at Vietnam National University in Hanoi. Ms. Taylor, the Verisk Maplecroft analyst, said that she expected Vietnam to continue exploring offshore energy resources with foreign partners, in part because the government was eager to have energy security that could help power brisk economic growth. She noted that Vietnam had so far “held the line” on a separate plan to drill for gas in another area of the sea in partnership with Exxon Mobil. Ms. Taylor said that Vietnam’s uncertainty over the United States’ commitment in the South China Sea under the Trump administration was significant, but also a familiar feeling across Southeast Asia for decades. Even the Obama administration’s so-called strategic pivot to Asia, she said, had been “a little late — maybe better than never, but not enough to assure people.”
world/asia,Investigations Stymied in Malaysia, Critics of Najib Razak Take Their Case Global - The New York Times PENANG, Malaysia —  Since reports first surfaced alleging that hundreds of millions of dollars had been transferred into the personal accounts of the Malaysian prime minister, investigations into the scandal have met stiff government resistance. Now they are on life support. Investigators have been sidelined, the publications of a crusading news organization have been suspended, and a deputy prime minister who asked too many questions was fired. Faced with what they see as stonewalling at home, opponents of Prime Minister Najib Razak, some from within his own party, are going global, prodding foreign governments and agencies to investigate allegations of graft and money laundering they say are related to the case. Some international inquiries have already begun. The Swiss authorities have opened an investigation into assets linked to a sovereign wealth fund that Mr. Najib leads. The Hong Kong police say they are looking into deposits made at a branch of a Swiss bank there. And a state investment fund in the United Arab Emirates is reportedly seeking clarification over a debt payment of more than a billion dollars that was promised by the sovereign wealth fund but may not have been delivered. John Pang, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, says moves by foreign law enforcement agencies could create pressure for more robust Malaysian investigations, which he describes as verging on moribund.
world/asia,“I don’t think that anyone thinks international efforts will unseat Najib alone,” Mr. Pang said. “The hope is that they will embolden, support or fortify the investigative efforts at home.” Toward that end, a relatively junior member of Mr. Najib’s party, Khairuddin Abu Hassan, has been touring the globe, dropping off documents at the offices of law enforcement agencies. “This is the biggest financial scandal we’ve ever had in our country,” Mr. Khairuddin said in an interview in Penang last week. “But those who are involved in the investigation of this case are being arrested and questioned by the police.” Mr. Khairuddin seems to have the backing of influential politicians and disgruntled officials. In what he calls a “road show” for justice, he has traveled to Switzerland, Britain, France, Hong Kong and Singapore over the past three months to deliver packets of information related to the sovereign wealth fund at the center of the scandal. The fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, is chaired by Mr. Najib. Mr. Najib’s critics say the fund has lost large sums of money and taken on expensive debt. The government has struggled to explain the spaghetti-like complexity of its financial transactions across the globe, including funds held in offshore tax havens. The most explosive revelation was the nearly $700 million transferred to Mr. Najib in 2013 from entities reported to be linked to 1MDB. Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing, saying he had “never taken funds for personal gain,” but has not specifically explained where the money came from.
world/asia,Mr. Khairuddin declined to specify who is assisting him in his investigative efforts, but many in Malaysia suspect that he is being fed tips and documents by a range of people unhappy with Mr. Najib, including Mahathir Mohamad, a former Malaysian prime minister waging a campaign to unseat Mr. Najib. In his road show, Mr. Khairuddin is sometimes accompanied by his lawyer, Matthias Chang, a former senior adviser to Mr. Mahathir. Mr. Chang traveled to Bern, the Swiss capital, with Mr. Khairuddin in August, and they dropped off documents pertaining to money laundering at the attorney general’s office there, the two men said. The Swiss investigation, which was underway before the pair visited, is moving forward. Last week, the Swiss authorities said they had frozen tens of millions of dollars in Swiss accounts related to the case. They are seeking the cooperation of the Malaysian authorities, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office said. In Hong Kong, Mr. Khairuddin filed a police report accompanied by a photograph of a document that he says contains Mr. Najib’s handwritten notations indicating that 1.125 billion Malaysian ringgit, about $260 million, was transferred into Credit Suisse accounts in the city. The documents list four companies as the beneficiaries of the accounts, but Mr. Khairuddin said Mr. Najib had signatory powers over them. He said the photo came from an “insider” in Mr. Najib’s circle who is now disenchanted. The Malaysian government called the accusations “baseless and politically motivated lies.”
world/asia,“The Prime Minister does not control any Credit Suisse bank accounts in Hong Kong, whether in his name or the name of the companies mentioned,” the government said in a statement emailed to The New York Times. “This latest bid to smear and criminalize the prime minister via Dr. Mahathir’s discredited henchman Khairuddin Abu Hassan is the most desperate yet,” the statement said. “It will fail, because the allegations are false.” Credit Suisse declined to comment on the matter. The Hong Kong police said an investigation was underway and confirmed they had received information about “some bank deposits.” In Malaysia, the central bank and the anticorruption commission are still officially investigating, but the case has been stymied by transfers of vital officials and an aggressive police investigation into leaks to the news media. Last month, the police raided the offices of the anticorruption commission, ostensibly to investigate a leak. In a purge that stunned the nation in late July, Mr. Najib removed the attorney general and fired several cabinet ministers, including the deputy prime minister, who had publicly raised questions about the issue. A parliamentary committee investigating the fund was gutted when Mr. Najib promoted vital members to more senior posts in the government. In August, the government disbanded a task force investigating 1MDB. And the deputy head of the powerful Special Branch of the police was removed from his post, a move he attributed to his insistence that the investigation into the sovereign wealth fund be “conducted transparently.”
world/asia,The Malaysian authorities have also frozen the accounts of Mr. Khairuddin using a law that seeks to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The notice served to Mr. Khairuddin did not elaborate on the allegations against him. Mr. Najib’s government also has a high degree of control over the police, the bureaucracy and the news media. In July, the government suspended the license of The Edge Financial Daily and The Edge Financial Weekly, sister publications that were taking a leading role in investigating the scandal. One of the leading sources of leaks and information on the scandal has been The Sarawak Report, a website based in Britain beyond the government’s reach. The government sought an international arrest warrant for the website’s founder, Clare Rewcastle-Brown, but Interpol, the international police agency, rejected the request. In July, the government blocked access to The Sarawak Report in Malaysia, but bulletins are widely circulated over social media. It was The Sarawak Report, along with The Wall Street Journal, that first reported the transfer of nearly $700 million into what were believed to be Mr. Najib’s accounts. The government’s anticorruption commission, in its investigation, confirmed that the money had gone into Mr. Najib’s accounts, but said that it had come from an unidentified donor in the Middle East, not 1MDB. Mr. Pang, the expert in Malaysian politics, says the international investigations are warranted.
world/asia,“Massive sums of Malaysian public money have been moved around the world and hundreds of millions have gone inexplicably into the private accounts of individuals,” he said. “It says something about the state of global financial oversight that no red flags were raised, or that if they were, nothing has been done about it until now.”
us/politics,Hillary Clinton Ad Seconds Obama on Guns, Rebuking Bernie Sanders - The New York Times Seizing on gun control, an issue on which she sees an opportunity to align herself with President Obama and against Senator Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton has released a new ad titled “I’m With Him.” Mrs. Clinton, seated in what looks like her living room, speaks directly to the camera for all but four seconds of this 30-second commercial. Shown from the shoulders up, with soft piano chords introducing her, Mrs. Clinton strikes a serious and concerned tone: “An average of 90 people are killed by guns in this country every single day. It has to stop.” She recites two of the president’s key proposals on gun legislation — requiring universal background checks and allowing lawsuits against the firearms industry “when their guns are used to kill our children” — before framing the choice for Democratic voters: “It’s time to pick a side. Either we stand with the gun lobby, or we join the president and stand up to them. I’m with him.” A photograph of Mrs. Clinton in profile, smiling as she stands before a campaign crowd, appears briefly as she adds, “Please join us.” The fairly simple and straightforward gun control argument draws an unspoken but obvious enough contrast with Mr. Sanders, who Mrs. Clinton has asserted has not being tough enough on the industry. (Mr. Sanders attributes some of his voting record on the issue to his constituency in rural Vermont.) Mrs. Clinton’s closing line echoes what she says on the campaign trail: that Mr. Sanders failed to stand up to the gun lobby in voting for a 2005 bill that granted immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from most liability lawsuits.
us/politics,Mrs. Clinton’s assertion that “an average of 90 people are killed by guns” lines up with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that more than 33,000 people died from gunshots in 2014; more than 21,000 of those were by suicide. The two proposalsshe cites address problems that were highlighted in an Op-Ed article by Mr. Obama in The New York Times last week. Mr. Sanders says that, as a member of the House, he voted for the 2005 bill to protect small law-abiding gun dealers. He supports expanding background checks, although in the 1990s, he voted against the Brady Bill, which required them. His campaign has said that Mr. Sanders objected then to the waiting period it imposed on handgun purchases. On cable television nationally and on broadcast stations in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mrs. Clinton is doing everything she can to tie herself to Mr. Obama on guns, an issue that allows her to connect with many Democratic voters, and to draw a contrast between their positions and those of Mr. Sanders. It is not an easy sell: Mr. Sanders has a lifetime record of D minus from the National Rifle Association to wield in his defense.
nyregion,Connecticut Prepares for Consequences of New Gun Laws - The New York Times Guns shops were jammed. Gun manufacturers were angry. Gun-control advocates were thrilled. Many legislators were torn. But as President Obama on Tuesday announced a visit to Connecticut next week in the wake of an agreement on a far-ranging package of state gun legislation, Connecticut was bracing for the consequences, intended or not. The most immediate result of the agreement, which came more than three months after the massacre of 26 children and educators in Newtown, was a run on gun shops on Tuesday, following months of already brisk sales. Gun owners are rushing to buy weapons, ammunition and magazines in anticipation of limits on their sale and possession. A package of gun, mental health and school security legislation that leaders in the General Assembly agreed to on Monday includes a ban on the sale of magazines carrying more than 10 bullets and the registration of existing ones; an expansion of the existing assault weapons ban; background checks on all firearms sales; and a registry of weapons offenders. Lawmakers are expected to pass the legislation on Wednesday. Vic Benson, co-owner of the Freedom Shoppe, a gun shop in New Milford, said that his store was not usually even open on Tuesday, but that he opened its doors in anticipation of panicked buyers, and also to get rid of inventory he thinks he will be unable to sell after lawmakers vote on Wednesday.
nyregion,“We’ve got a fire sale going on here,” he said. “Whatever doesn’t sell by the time they pass this law is going to be useless. Basically, $100,000 worth of paperweights. ” One customer, John Gursky, 22, of New Milford, was stocking up on 30-round magazines and ammunition he said he uses recreationally. “Nothing they’re trying to pass right now is going to help the crime rate. It’s only going to make it worse,” he said. But legislators, many Sandy Hook Elementary School families, gun-control groups and big-city mayors praised the legislation. On Monday, families representing 11 of those who died at Sandy Hook called for a ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines, which was not included in the final legislative package. But Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who had supported the ban, said on Tuesday that he would sign the legislation anyway. And Sandy Hook Promise, the group representing the families of the 11 victims, said that adding the requirement to register existing magazines strengthened the legislation considerably. “We thank the legislature for passing the strongest gun responsibility legislation in the nation,” the group said in a statement. Not all the families of the victims were in agreement. Many have been silent on gun issues, and one parent, Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, died at Sandy Hook, appeared at the National Rifle Association’s news conference on Tuesday to praise its proposal to put armed personnel in the nation’s schools.
nyregion,Urban mayors including William Finch of Bridgeport, John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven and Pedro Segarra of Hartford praised the legislation. “It’s bipartisan legislation that’s worthy of the tragedy that befell our state and our nation in Newtown,” Mr. Segarra said. Very much in doubt is the future of gun manufacturers in a state once known as the cradle of the American gun industry. Many gun makers, like other manufacturers, have long since left the state. But according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation in Newtown, gun manufacturers in Connecticut account for 2,899 jobs — 7,340 including related businesses, such as suppliers — and have a $1.7 billion economic impact. They include giants like Colt Manufacturing; O. F. Mossberg & Sons, the oldest family-owned firearms manufacturer in America; and Stag Arms of New Britain, founded 10 years ago, which is unable to keep pace with its orders. Stag produces 6,000 AR-15 rifles a month, which critics call assault weapons but users and the gun industry call “modern sporting rifles.” All of the companies have been wooed by other states, particularly those in the South and West. Mark Malkowski, the 34-year-old founder of Stag Arms, said he grew up in New Britain, where the company is based, and had never before considered leaving the state. But he said he would consider it now. “If our product is so bad, so dangerous, why would the state of Connecticut want us to produce it here, create jobs here, manufacture it here and ship it to all the other states?” he said.
business/dealbook,Brazilian Uber Rival Raises $100 Million From SoftBank - The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO — A Latin American competitor to Uber — 99 — has raised $100 million from SoftBank of Japan to fuel growth, the Brazilian start-up’s chief executive says. SoftBank will become a minority shareholder in the privately held 99, as the ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing of China did when it backed the start-up in January. SoftBank is also a major investor in Didi Chuxing. The transaction, which was completed last week when Peter Fernandez, 99’s chief executive, traveled to Tokyo and met with the SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, puts another obstacle in Uber’s path to succeed in emerging markets. For SoftBank, the investment is a rare deal in Brazil and comes in the middle of political upheaval. The country’s president faces corruption accusations and his future is in doubt. That political uncertainty is expected to further delay the economic recovery here, needed after two years of severe recession. Yet neither the recent volatility nor the past uncertainty appears to have scared away SoftBank. It was not a major concern of the company, Mr. Fernandez said. “The political and macroeconomic situation did not affect our discussion,” he said. “That does not affect the fundamentals of our business, because at the end of the day, there are 200 million people who still need transportation.”
business/dealbook,Mr. Fernandez joined 99, based in São Paulo, in January 2016, initially brought on board as chief product officer by one of the company’s founders, Paulo Veras. He was made chief executive last October, and his main task was to find global strategic partners. He was previously head of mobile and social for Google Latin America. Before that, he served as head of Latin America for AdMob, which was acquired by Google in 2009. Mr. Fernandez said that 99 planned to use the new capital to expand its peer-to-peer ride offering, called 99POP, which it started in the fourth quarter of last year. The company, founded in 2012, initially focused on working with taxi drivers and was first called 99Taxis, providing an alternative to Uber. It continues to grow in that area, but it is now putting more effort into the POP service. “The goal is to dominate Brazil and dominate peer-to-peer,” the chief executive said. He noted that in São Paulo, 50 percent of the company’s rides are peer-to-peer. The company says it has more than 200,000 drivers and more than 14 million registered users. Mr. Fernandez, though, understands that the sector is capital intensive. “We’re going to need to raise a lot more capital. This is just one step in a very long path ahead of us,” he said. Earlier investors in 99 include Monashees, Riverwood Capital, Qualcomm Ventures and Tiger Global Management. SoftBank recently announced it had nearly finished raising its $100 billion fund, the Vision Fund, for global technology investments.
business/dealbook,On May 22, SoftBank said it had completed a first close with over $93 billion committed. Investors include the Public Investment Fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Mubadala Investment Company of the United Arab Emirates, Apple and Qualcomm. It said it expected final closing to occur within six months. “The fact that they’re coming in is a really big deal for the country,” Mr. Fernandez said of the SoftBank fund. For start-ups maturing and trying to grow, “access to capital in Latin America is really difficult, and much more so than in the U.S., Asia or Europe,” he said.
sports/tennis,From the Quiet of Wimbledon, the Loud Groan of the Crowd - The New York Times Tradition is as much a part of the Wimbledon experience as the grass itself, from the predominantly white clothing rule to the strawberries and cream sold around the grounds of the All England Club. But when Wimbledon begins this week, mixed in with the cheers will be one thing the world’s leading tennis players do not appreciate quite so much: the Wimbledon groan. Urrrr. Low-pitched, almost tailing off at the end, it is a sigh of disappointment, of lost hope. Urrrr. Often after a double fault or a simple mistake, it can affect anyone but seems louder and clearer when a home player misses on an important point. “I hated that, I really hated that,” said Pat Cash, the Australian who won Wimbledon in 1987. “My sports psychologist actually worked with me on that. You make a mistake and everyone went urrrr.” Cash said he wanted to tell the crowd to shut up. “Do you think I meant to serve a double fault? Thanks very much for reinforcing that bad feeling,” he added. The groan is not unique to Wimbledon. But it is more obvious there because, in contrast to the United States Open, for example, it is much more common for the crowd to fall into silence before points begin. The grass muffles the sound of the ball bounce, too, so when the urrrr comes, it is inescapable.
sports/tennis,“I heard a lot of groans, a lot,” said Pam Shriver, the former top-ranked doubles player, who is now an analyst with ESPN. “It can be embarrassing, especially if it’s on Centre Court.” Shriver remembered her “biggest groan.” It came in 1996 when she was playing Anke Huber in the second round. “It was the last time I played after 19 years of playing there, and I hit a double fault on match point,” Shriver said. “My second serve, I was serving up the sunny end, it caught the top of my frame and it landed in my service box. On Centre Court, the last point of my Wimbledon singles career. Oh, yeah, I heard it big time.” For British players, the groan is an occupational hazard. In the 1990s, a Tim Henman match would not be complete without a few urrrrs. Henman, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 and made it to four Wimbledon semifinals, was a common victim, the groans coming with double faults, forehands into the net or whenever he let go a ball that landed in. Hear an example around the 2:40 mark of this video: Miles Maclagan, a former coach of Andy Murray, the current world No. 1, said Wimbledon could be a “lonely place if you get too many of the groans.” “I think even within the groan there can be different attitudes or vibes to it,” he added. “In the past with Tim, unfortunately, it was sort of like, ‘Oh, here we go again.’ I think that attitude changed with Andy, and people expect to see him win now.”
sports/tennis,Shriver said she did not consider the groan to be that negative. “I just considered that they were cheering for you and it was their way of saying, ‘I’m sorry,’” she said. “But you hated hearing it twice in a row.” Jo Durie, the top-ranked British woman for much of a career that spanned from 1977 to 1995, won the mixed doubles title once at Wimbledon. Durie, now a commentator with Eurosport, said the groan was tough to cope with. Especially when things are going wrong in a match, she said, “you’d like a little bit of a lift from the crowd, not to hear that sigh, or tutting.” Mark Petchey, the British No. 1 for a time in the 1990s, who was Murray’s first coach as a professional, said, “You can kind of smile about it now, but it definitely erodes your self-confidence at times when you hear that noise.” He added that the groan “magnified by 10 that it was a terrible shot.” It was difficult to block out, and, Petchey said, “I heard it a lot.” “I guess certain players out there have different perspectives and can probably say: ‘Well, you guys don’t know what you’re talking about, so it wasn’t such a bad miss,’” he said. “I was unfortunately on the other side and thought: ‘Yeah, yeah, you guys were spot on. That was shocking.’” Durie, Petchey and Maclagan stressed that the Wimbledon crowd was generally a big help for home players, always encouraging and usually desperate for them to do well. Cash, once he had figured it out, felt the same.
sports/tennis,He said his sports psychologist had told him, “Mate, everyone just wants you to win.” “And I was like: ‘Oh, that’s a good point as well. I feel better about that now.’” Current players also struggle. Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic, a former junior Wimbledon champion who was ranked inside the world’s top 10 just 18 months ago before suffering wrist injuries, said she experienced it a lot. “They do it a lot because I double-fault a lot,” she said. “That’s horrible, and you’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, you do it yourself, right?’ But also it’s nice when you hit a huge winner and everyone goes crazy.” Stan Wawrinka said he tried to see it as a positive thing. “It’s actually nice to see that the crowd is really into the match,” he said. “Of course you are not happy at all after making an easy mistake, but it’s not the crowd’s fault. “I think that tennis crowds in general are very respectful,” he continued. “We have great fans in our sport. We all make mistakes, and when it looks easy, people can be surprised. Haven’t we all done the same in front of our TV screens?” For those with hopes of winning the title, the groan may be something that happens to other people, said Greg Rusedski, a former British No. 1 who is a Eurosport commentator. “If you look at Roger, I don’t think he ever gets groaned at,” Rusedski said, referring to the seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer. “He probably hits the most beautiful double fault anyway, so they still clap.”
fashion,Turning Points at Dries Van Noten and Chloé - The New York Times “Change is not always bad. Change can be good.” So said Dries Van Noten before his 100th show. He was referring to his own milestone, and the need to move on, to mix things up a bit, to turn the page on one chapter and start another. Still, it’s kind of a funny statement for a fashion person to make. At least when you think about all the complaining that has gone on over the last few years thanks to the upheaval caused by designers’ leaving (or being forced to leave) houses like a warp-speed version of a snake shedding its skin. Was Mr. Van Noten just putting a positive spin on the situation? Magical thinking? Perhaps. Though he is a designer who has always dealt in reality. The old order is in flux in ways that go far beyond clothes; orthodoxies are being overturned practically every day (and executive orders issued). You can’t really deny it. And given that fashion is partly premised on change — observing it, reflecting it — if designers can’t make it seem like a palatable situation, what chance is there for the rest of us? For Mr. Van Noten, there were no rose-colored glasses involved. He did it by learning from history (his own) and deliberately trying not to repeat it.
fashion,Using signature prints from his earliest collection through the most recent seasons — a paisley from fall 1997, an ikat from spring 2010, a Chinese dragon motif from fall 2012, a chintzy rose from spring 2000, to name a few — he superimposed Pop Art graphics on top to create a conversation between past and future, both in the clothes and via the woman who wore them. Hello, Nadja Auermann! Hello, Cecilia Chancellor. Hello, Alek Wek and Carolyn Murphy and Kirsten Owen and Liya Kebede. Hello to a whole host of once-famous mannequins who had appeared in Mr. Van Noten’s shows through the decades, and who returned — along with the more familiar gang of current girls — not to recreate their days of former glory, but rather to demonstrate how new lives look and bodies grow up. Or as Mr. Van Noten said, “Women dressing as they would like to dress themselves, to express who they really are.” Like, for example, in a buttoned-up oversize man’s wool coat (men’s wear is everywhere this season) with big split-toned sequined spheres on the hem, over a crisp white shirt. Or an iridescent metallic blazer over a long beige turtleneck and cropped bronze culottes. Or a beaded flapper tank top woven onto a thin shirt of tulle tucked into slouchy white jeans, arms draped in a lavish fake fur stole. In their multilayered dichotomy, they were both familiar and not at all.
fashion,Which is not a bad way to describe where we are at this particular moment in time, when you think about it. Certainly, it was more effective than the proposal at Rochas, where Alessandro Dell’Acqua seems to be stuck in a rut of 1940s pastels, kitschy logos (this time in the form of rhinestone “R”s on sweaters, belts and shoes) and zebra striping — which is to say, bits from this decade, and bits from that decade. Remixed to be sure, but nevertheless too literal to look modern. He’s just spinning his wheels. Clare Waight Keller, however, is out of here — or at least out of Chloé. In her last show for the brand that she has steered for six years (she is moving on, though to do what and where has not yet been revealed), Ms. Waight Keller toggled between two poles: sweet short 1960s silhouettes in psychedelic prints and filmy fabrics and elongated, meaty tailoring with a military air. “I was interested in the whole idea of morphing from one dreamscape world into another, because I feel like we are going through that transition now in the world,” she said backstage before the show, surrounded by jostling photographers and posing models. “There are all these elements in conflict, and in a way in a collection, you can offer a resolution for that, and also a way to escape.”
fashion,So she did. What looked like ornate William Morris wallpapers on little crepe dresses with floppy bows at the neck hid magic mushrooms, swirling black and white sorted itself out into profiles from afar, mohair was rainbow-striped, leather pinafores lacquered, and trousers were slung low on the hips, cut generously through the leg, and gathered at the ankle. Shoes were low and squared-heeled, and there were only two bag shapes. Indeed, lots of outfits came with no handbags at all. At the end, the audience rose in a standing ovation to pay homage to her tenure, and gold squares of confetti drifted down from backstage. Wait — hang on a minute. Almost no bags? Turning point. Told you.
theater,Hello? Dolly? Bette Midler Seems Unlikely to Sing at Tony Awards - The New York Times Josh Groban plans to lead the cast of “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812” in a mash-up of the show’s ballad and its big dance number at the Tony Awards ceremony next month. Ben Platt expects to perform “Waving Through a Window,” an emotional song from “Dear Evan Hansen.” The cast of “Falsettos,” a show that closed in January, will reunite to perform a number from that musical. There is still time for a change of plans, but at the moment it appears unlikely that Bette Midler, one of the biggest stars of the current Broadway season, will be singing during the June 11 CBS broadcast. According to multiple people with knowledge of the broadcast plans, the producers of “Hello, Dolly!” and the producers of the awards show reached an impasse over the conditions under which Ms. Midler would sing, and as a result the plan is for her to present an award, but not to perform. Instead, her co-star and fellow nominee, David Hyde Pierce, is expected to perform a solo from the show. The impasse was described by people who would not speak for attribution because of confidentiality rules imposed by the Tony Awards.
theater,The issue matters to producers of the Tony Awards ceremony, which this year is being hosted by Kevin Spacey, because it could affect TV viewership. A famous actress singing a familiar song from a classic musical might add pizazz to an event that, like all awards shows, has struggled to retain viewers. Ms. Midler’s absence would also disappoint fans who can’t afford to see her in the Broadway show, which has a top ticket price of $748 and few seats left, but who would love to glimpse her in the role. A Tony Awards spokeswoman would say only: “We don’t discuss specifics about the musical performances in advance of the telecast. The show is still in the planning stage and subject to change.” And a spokesman for “Hello, Dolly!” and its lead producer, Scott Rudin, also had little to say. “‘Hello, Dolly!’ will perform on the ‘71st Annual Tony Awards’ telecast,” the spokesman said. “At the request of Tony Award Productions, we are not able to discuss anything further about the performance.” “Hello, Dolly!,” nominated for best musical revival and nine other awards, is pulling in weekly grosses higher than those of any other show that opened during the just-concluded 2016-17 season. The awards-show producers offered the musical a prime spot on the television broadcast, hoping Ms. Midler would lead the cast in a performance of its title song.
theater,But the musical’s producers said that they would perform the number only remotely, from their stage at the Shubert Theater, and not on the ceremony’s stage at Radio City Music Hall. They argued that the different configuration of the stage at Radio City — and, in particular, its passerelle — could pose a risk to leaping dancers and would not do the song justice. The awards show declined to allow “Hello, Dolly!” to perform remotely, concerned about setting a precedent. The Tonys have occasionally aired musical numbers remotely from other theaters, but in recent years the broadcast has ended that practice. The broadcast is still taking shape, and it remains possible that the “Dolly!” plans could change. But the current plan is for Mr. Pierce, nominated for a Tony as Dolly’s beau Horace Vandergelder, to sing “Penny in My Pocket.” That song was cut from the original Broadway production but restored in this revival. Instead of singing, Ms. Midler would present an award — possibly to the leading actor in a play. In that case, “Hello, Dolly!” would be the only one of seven nominated musicals (four for best new musical, three for best musical revival) in which the most recognizable performer does not sing on the broadcast.
fashion,These Triplet Models Want to Take This Town by the Throat - The New York Times Hundreds of people, many dressed in elaborate fur and sequined outfits, packed the Grand Central Cipriani restaurant on Thursday for the runway show of Romeo & Juliet Couture. Their eyes were on the catwalk as the first model, petite with strawberry-blond hair, emerged from backstage in a floral top, faux leather jacket and high-wasted maxi skirt. After completing her circuit, another woman took her place. Her outfit was different; she was wearing a strapless gingham top paired with washed black jeans. But her face and walk looked eerily similar to the first model. “They must be sisters,” said John Gavras, a senior associate for the LiRo Group, a construction management firm, who was watching the show with his two adult daughters in an elevated V.I.P. section. “Or are all models supposed to look the same?” a neighboring stranger said. When the third model appeared, looking indistinguishable from the first two, the crowd finally figured it out. “They are triplets,” Mr. Gavras said. “Holy cow! It’s incredible.” Runway shows are generally civilized affairs, with observers expressing themselves through creative outfits, not shouts. But as the identical triplet models, named Andrea, Arianna and Athena Levesque, took one lap together, the crowd started clapping loudly and hollering as if it were a sporting event. “You heard it,” said David Shamouelian, the owner and C.E.O. of Romeo & Juliet Couture. “There was power behind these triplets.”
fashion,It’s not the first time multiple births have graced the fashion world. Identical twins who go by the names Cipriana Quann and TK Wonder appeared in a recent Kenneth Cole advertising campaign. In October the designer Jun Takahashi cast five sets of identical twins to close his show at Paris Fashion Week. But triplets are rarer than twins, and for the past two years these sisters, 24 and living in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, have convinced multiple designers, television producers and filmmakers that their showcases will be better with their participation. They have come down the catwalk for designers including Adrian Alicea and Andre Emery. They have appeared on “Good Morning America.” There is reality-show interest, they said. “We aren’t allowed to say who just yet,” Arianna said with a grin. In September they plan to introduce their own feminine, but not too girlie, clothing line of denim and trucker jackets, jumpsuits and florals. They have a studio in their three-bedroom apartment, where they photograph themselves and other models and actors for extra pay. They also act and have appeared in a few short films including the popular video for Circa Survive’s song “Premonition of the Hex.” Arianna is the stylist and designer, Andrea is the photographer, and Athena is the lead actress. But they almost always market themselves as one. “There are a lot of pretty blond girls, but there aren’t that many triplets,” Athena said. “We should use it.”
fashion,Many multiples try to differentiate themselves as individuals, but for marketing purposes this set is determined to be as identical as possible. If one of them wants a haircut, all must agree to get the same look. “I wanted bangs a couple of months ago, but my sisters told me they didn’t, so we couldn’t do it,” Andrea said. “They saved me.” They don’t always have to try that hard. The morning of the Romeo & Juliet show they put on matching shoes, leggings and oversize sweaters without consulting one another, they said. The apartment is shared with Andrea’s cat, Arianna’s cat and Athena’s 55-pound dog. “The animals can tell us apart,” Athena said. “They know who their parents are.” Since they were young girls, growing up in Hyannis, Mass., the sisters wanted to do things together. At 11 they wore shirts Arianna made out of old pillowcases to school. As seniors, they starred together in “Twelfth Night,” with Athena and Arianna cast as Viola and Andrea playing Feste, the singing fool. “Our teacher was so worried about how to give us all lead roles,” Andrea said. “He was so relieved when he found out I could sing better than them.” After attending different colleges, study-abroad programs and graduate schools, they all moved to New York City to give modeling — something they had done for fun — a try professionally. “Other careers were always something we could go back to,” Andrea said. “But modeling is something we can only do now. And it’s something I can do with my sisters now.”
fashion,And they have become more value as a threesome. “We have done shoots with them individually, but the triplets is what makes a difference,” Mr. Shamouelian said. (Arianna also works part time as one of his assistant designers.) “I don’t really know if I would have used them if it was just one because I tend to use models that are 5′9 and up,” Mr. Emery said. (The Levesques are 5-foot-6.) “But because they are triplets I knew I could be creative with them. I knew people would say, ‘Whoa, this is a new trend.’” The triplets have a long list of bigger designers they want to model for, including Dolce & Gabanna and Tom Ford. But there are downsides to the sisters working together, said Sara Ziff, the founder and executive director of the Model Alliance, a New York City advocacy organization for models. “Booking triplet models is a very specific choice on the part of the client,” she said. “I imagine it might be limiting for the models themselves if they are always sold as a package deal.” (The triplets respond by saying that they encourage each other to get big gigs on their own. It will only elevate all of them, they reason.) Ms. Ziff also worries that the presence of identical-triplet models reinforces a notion in the fashion world that all models should look exactly the same. “It’s arresting to see people as carbon copies. With hair and makeup, models are often made to look interchangeable, and their individuality is subsumed by the brand,” she said. “Having the same DNA takes that to another level.”
fashion,Mr. Emery, though, dresses the triplets differently, with one in a robe for his debut, another looking like she was headed to a nightclub. “I want them to have their own individual style and taste,” he said. And the models insist they don’t care so long as the clothes fit well and are flattering. “The only important thing is that we are either all the same or all different,” Athena said. “I just don’t like it when two people are the same, and I have to be different. We are triplets.”
world/europe,Eritrean Accused of Trafficking Migrants Is Captured in Sudan, Italy Says - The New York Times ROME — An Eritrean man accused of organizing an extensive people-smuggling network that led to the deaths of hundreds of Africans trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea has been captured in Sudan and extradited to Italy, the authorities said Wednesday. The arrest, which followed an investigation that involved the Sudanese, Italian and British authorities, was a rare instance in which a person has faced direct criminal charges for the human trafficking that has made the Mediterranean one of the world’s deadliest migration routes. Officials said the smuggling ring was responsible for the deaths of 359 people when a vessel capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013. The authorities said the man styled himself as “the General” — a reference to the reach of his criminal network — and that he had been heard on intercepted telephone calls joking callously about the deaths of migrants who were fleeing violence and desperation. The Italian authorities identified the man as Medhanie Yehdego Mered, 35, though the information could not be independently confirmed. Mr. Mered, they said, was seized in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, on May 24, and flown to Rome on Tuesday night. But after the arrest was reported on Wednesday, an Eritrean activist and journalist who hosts a weekly radio program in Stockholm, as well as an article in The Guardian, raised doubts about the identity of the man in custody.
world/europe,In a telephone interview, the activist, Meron Estefanos, said she had been following the activities of Mr. Mered since 2010. “When I saw the news this morning that the most wanted smuggler had been extradited, I was happy,” she said. But after video clips of the man in custody began circulating, she began receiving telephone calls — from refugees who said they had been smuggled by Mr. Mered, and people who said they were friends and relatives of the man who had been extradited. All said that the Italians had the wrong man. “I hope that the Italians admit that they have the wrong person and that they release the person immediately,” Ms. Estefanos said. “This is absurd.” Asked about the possibility of a mistake, Britain’s National Crime Agency said in a statement late Thursday night that “we have noted the Guardian’s report. This is a complex multipartner operation, and it is too soon to speculate about these claims.” “The N.C.A. is confident in its intelligence-gathering process,” the agency said. Earlier, the crime agency said that the Sudanese police carried out the arrest after the British authorities tracked the suspect to an address in the El Diem area of Khartoum. “Telephone interceptions gathered by the Italians confirmed Medhanie was organizing regular journeys across the Mediterranean, and was also directly coordinating other people-smugglers responsible for land routes,” the agency said in a statement, using what the Italian authorities said was Mr. Mered’s first name. “During one recorded conversation Medhanie was heard laughing about the fatal overloading of migrant ships.”
world/europe,The sinking of the boat, a flimsy fishing vessel, off Lampedusa on Oct. 3, 2013, was a signal moment in the migration crisis. While refugees from the Syrian civil war have been among the most prominent faces of the problem, many other migrants from strife-torn countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Sudan and Eritrea, have traveled to Libya, where there is barely a functioning government. Part of the Italian region of Sicily, Lampedusa, about 70 miles from Tunisia, has been a destination for many African migrants. The boat was packed with more than 500 people. Of the 155 who survived the shipwreck, around 100 ended up in Sweden. “This operation is important not only because it struck one of the bosses of a criminal ring that has smuggled thousands of people, but also because it effectively demonstrated international judicial and police cooperation,” Francesco Lo Voi, the chief prosecutor in Palermo, the regional capital, said on Wednesday. Mr. Lo Voi said that Mr. Mered had been responsible for smuggling thousands of migrants to Italy since 2012, making “enormous profits” without regard for the life-threatening risks taken by the migrants. Like the British authorities, Mr. Lo Voi took note of the phone call in which Mr. Mered was recorded laughing about the overloading of the boats. A statement from Mr. Lo Voi’s office said Mr. Mered “not only directed the activities in the African continent, but also constantly kept abreast his collaborators in Italy with the boat arrivals, so that migrants could continue traveling to their final destination.”
world/europe,“The General” is suspected of controlling a large area through his contacts and of personally coordinating smugglers on the land routes in Africa, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries. In several cases, Italian prosecutors said, he paid Libyan officials to free migrants from Libyan jails, then sought to extort compensation from the migrants’ families. In one wiretapped conversation, Mr. Mered boasted that he had paid $40,000 to Libyan jailers to free a group of people. The migrants were “authorized” to leave for Italy — or to leave Italy for other parts of Europe — only after their relatives made additional payments, prosecutors said. The payments were made in phases: one for the land route through Libya, a second to cover the sea crossing and a final payment if the migrants made it to destinations north, like Germany or Sweden. “This business had a great economic value,” a prosecutor in Sicily, Maurizio Scalia, said Wednesday in a news conference. Mr. Mered, the prosecutors said, had boasted that he had bought a house in Eritrea and could receive bank payments in and from any European country, and even in Israel. He was recorded as saying that he had a brother in the Netherlands, and a wife and son in Sweden and hoped to join her there after stashing enough money from his “accumulated treasure,” prosecutors said.
world/asia,Tough Stand by India’s Modi on Militants Raises Risks With Pakistan - The New York Times NEW DELHI — As an opposition leader, Narendra Modi was a vocal critic of India’s government for not responding more forcefully to cross-border attacks from militants based in Pakistan. As prime minister, Mr. Modi has not shied away from openly retaliating in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir against the militants — and stirring up nationalist passions. Now, with his tough stance, there are growing concerns that Mr. Modi may have narrowed his options, raising the risks of war with India’s nuclear-armed rival, Pakistan. Experts are worrying about what India will do when Pakistan-based militants carry out another attack in India, as is almost certain. And how will Pakistan respond? “We’re not at the point of no return, but we are in very dangerous waters,” said Bruce Riedel, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in the Central Intelligence Agency, where he advised several American presidents on South Asia. “When we get to the next terror attack, which is probably only a matter of time, the prime minister has boxed himself in, and he can’t take the route his predecessors did and choose to use solely diplomatic alternatives without some loss of face,” Mr. Riedel said. After Pakistan-based militants attacked an army base in Kashmir in September, Mr. Modi publicly declared retaliatory strikes in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan region. Previous governments had made similar forays but only in covert operations.
world/asia,Mr. Modi followed the strikes with a campaign to isolate Pakistan diplomatically — he denounced the country as “a mother ship of terrorism” at a summit meeting last week — and they have unleashed a nationalist fury within India that may be hard to contain. That frenzy, stoked by the Indian news media, “is in danger of pushing India into conflict,” said Myra MacDonald, the author of “Defeat Is an Orphan: How Pakistan Lost the Great South Asian War.” Pakistani did not retaliate after India’s strikes last month, and instead tried to play them down. To acknowledge them would have forced Pakistan to retaliate, experts say, and Pakistan is not eager to plunge into a war. But the Pakistani Army cannot realistically deny anything took place after each incident, said Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian Army colonel who writes about defense for the Business Standard newspaper in New Delhi. “The Pakistani military would be forced to retaliate in the event of a more prominent strike,” in part to guard its image as the ever-vigilant protector of Pakistan, he said. And there is no predicting where such a conflict could lead, the experts say. “The big danger here is once you get started up the escalation ladder, how do you cool it off?” Mr. Riedel said. “I’m scared,” Mr. Shukla said. “We’re not Israel bullying Gaza, or the U.S. with Haiti. We’re the fourth-biggest army confronting the 11th-biggest army.”
world/asia,Still, many praise Mr. Modi for deftly handling the diplomacy around the September military strikes so Pakistan did not feel compelled to retaliate, and the United States and other nations were supportive. “Modi walked a very fine line that worked for him this time,” Mr. Shukla said. He said he believed Mr. Modi was confident that he could find a way to respond to the next militant attack without allowing the situation to spiral out of control. The latest strikes were too small to deter militant activity but might be strategically helpful by making Mr. Modi seem unpredictable and irrational to a Pakistan accustomed to a more muted response from India, Mr. Shukla said. The nuclear-armed neighbors have been facing off ever since gaining independence from Britain in 1947. They have fought three wars and routinely shoot each other’s soldiers in border disputes. In January, several militants infiltrated an Indian Air Force base and engaged in a daylong battle before they were killed. India said they were members of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad group, and Pakistan arrested several members in response. Then in September, militants attacked an army base near the line of control separating Indian-controlled Kashmir from the Pakistani side, killing 19 soldiers. India said items found on the slain militants bore Pakistani markings, but Pakistan denied involvement. Mr. Modi’s more aggressive public response has resonated with a public that has grown increasingly frustrated by the inability of successive governments to stop militant attacks that India believes — and in some cases has proved — emanate from Pakistan.
world/asia,Since 2001, militants have struck the Indian Parliament, Mumbai’s top hotels and the city’s main train station, in addition to military targets, among others. Mr. Modi’s predecessors were more risk averse by nature, Mr. Shukla said. “Modi is better at brinkmanship than they were in these actions where there’s an element of risk,” Mr. Shukla said. “Manmohan Singh would not take that risk and would place India’s economic development ahead of it,” he said, referring to the previous prime minister. That willingness to take risk derives in part from Mr. Modi’s ambition. Where his predecessors looked at Pakistan as a problem to be managed, the Modi administration seems to believe it can solve the Indian-Pakistani conflict, Ms. MacDonald said.“That’s dangerous, because I don’t think they can solve it,” she said. In his swearing-in ceremony in 2014, Mr. Modi invited Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to India, signaling an interest in making peace. He later visited Lahore for an impromptu visit with Mr. Sharif. But despite Mr. Modi’s overtures, the militant attacks have continued. Harsh V. Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College in London, said he believed Mr. Modi viewed as a personal affront the fact that “his overtures to Pakistan have gone in vain.”
world/asia,In reality, Mr. Sharif does not have full control over militant groups in his country, Mr. Riedel said. In Pakistan, power is divided between the democratically elected government and the military, whose powerful intelligence wing, experts say, is tied to some militant groups that carry out attacks in India. The leaders of the groups roam freely in Pakistan, some seen as local heroes. “Prime Minister Sharif knows better than most that there are limits to how far he can push the army without the army pushing him out the door,” Mr. Riedel said. In the nationalist fervor that has gripped India, a leading Bollywood film producers group voted to ban employing Pakistanis, and a major cinema organization said it would not screen films with Pakistani actors. The mainstream news media has jumped into the fray, with a popular television talk show host, Arnab Goswami, berating the Indian superstar Salman Khan for not supporting the ban on Pakistani actors. Nationalist sentiment has spiraled so high that even Mr. Modi may be powerless to contain it, Mr. Shukla said. “He’s gotten onto the tiger, and now he can’t get off,” he said. With elections coming up in Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party will be motivated to keep nationalist sentiment high because it has quickly subsumed economic development as the party’s main election platform there, Mr. Shukla said. But as useful as Mr. Modi might believe that frenzy is in winning votes, it is confirming fears in Pakistan that India is the aggressor and is not interested in peace, Ms. MacDonald said.
world/asia,“The message that the Indian government wants to give to Pakistan is we do want peace but we want you to get rid of” the militant groups, she said. In Pakistan, she said, “what’s coming across now is the opposite, and that’s created an atmosphere where a lot of people are rallying behind the army.” That pressures the Pakistani government against exercising restraint in the future. And in the “media frenzy,” there is little room for either side to initiate dialogue, “on the fringes of a meeting, to pick up the threads and talk,” Ms. MacDonald said. “It’s a very dangerous situation,” Mr. Riedel said, “one big terrorist attack from disaster.”
science,A Crazy Ant Invader Uses Acid to Its Advantage - The New York Times The crazy ant, the latest ant to invade North America, is having remarkable success at replacing its predecessor, the red fire ant, former king of the invaders. Part of the reason, according to research at the University of Texas, is that the newcomer can detoxify fire ant venom in a way not seen before in other insects or animals. The crazy ant uses its own venom to neutralize that of the fire ant, which is deadly to many other ants and gives the fire ant its notorious sting. Crazy ants, Nylanderia fulva, are named for their scattershot movements and were first seen in the Houston area and in Florida 12 years ago. They have since been found in Mississippi and Louisiana. They can quickly dominate an ecosystem, wiping out the fire ants that came before them, according to Edward G. LeBrun, who reported the new research Thursday in the journal Science. Dr. LeBrun and his colleagues Nathan T. Jones and Lawrence E. Gilbert exposed crazy ants to fire ant venom and recorded video of the behavior that followed.The crazy ants engaged in an intense kind of grooming, in which they repeatedly seemed to take their own venom from a pore in their abdomens and spread it all over themselves. After this behavior, 98 percent of the crazy ants survived. When the scientists blocked the pore that releases the venom, only 48 percent survived.
science,The researchers did additional tests to prove that the ants were using their own venom and to show that the main ingredient, formic acid, was what detoxified the fire ant venom. They don’t yet know how the detoxification works chemically. This is not good news for the fire ants, Dr. LeBrun said. The species, he said, are direct competitors and both are “opportunistic, omnivorous, ground foraging.” “Both feed on carrion,” he said. “Both fight with other ant species to control any resources.” And, he added, “they are also competing for nest space. Fire ants dig elaborate nests. Crazy ants don’t dig, but a great nest site is fire ant mounds.” The crazy ants are outcompeting the fire ants on all counts — and they have protection against fire ant venom. What this means for human beings depends on how you look at it. Fire ants sting. Crazy ants don’t. But crazy ants invade houses, crawl up pant legs, short out power lines and generally drive human beings themselves crazy. Dr. LeBrun said that, for people worried about the spread of crazy ants, human activity is the one thing that limits how fast they spread. Crazy ants only establish new colonies naturally when one gets too big and has to divide. This is a slow process. But if humans move them in wood or potted plants or anything that they are carrying in their cars and trucks, then they spread much faster.
science,As to the possibility of humans using formic acid as a defense against fire ant stings, Dr. LeBrun wrote in an email, “I’ve tried it. It does not help. In fact it is about as much fun as you might imagine letting a very large fire ant sting you and then smearing acid on the sting would be.”
business/dealbook,A Big Reason Wall Street Is Flocking to Spotify: DealBook Briefing - The New York Times Page 1  Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Spotify’s shares opened at $165.90. • If the markets fall again, we have some possible explanations. • Should Facebook offer “Why Me?” buttons? • Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox’s Sky bid. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Spotify is a loss-making company that might not report a profit until next decade, but that didn’t stop investors from valuing the company at $30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market. Spotify is an impressive company. Its loyal, paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing. Also, Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services. But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify: It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over. Spotify’s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies. That has bolstered Spotify’s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.
business/dealbook,Crucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify’s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent. But Spotify’s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify’s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term. — Peter Eavis Spotify’s unusual path to the public markets was a success. On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion. Spotify’s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01. That’s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It’s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week. Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no “deal price” for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.
business/dealbook,Despite all that, Spotify’s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange. Here’s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic: Alibaba — $233.9 billion Facebook — $81.7 billion Palm — $53.3 billion Infineon Technologies — $47.9 billion JD.com — $28.9 billion Snap — $28.9 billion Google — $27.2 billion Spotify — $26.5 billion Twitter — $24.9 billion Agilent — $20.1 billion Shares of the electric carmaker are up 3.3 percent Tuesday after the company released production data Tuesday that showed progress in producing its mass-market Model 3. Tesla said: • It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter. • Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter. • In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter. • It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg. • In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter. • The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. • The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters. Context
business/dealbook,Tesla’s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla’s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue. The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is “costing the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money” in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning. Shares are essentially flat on the day. The accusation is the latest in a string of critical tweets that began Thursday about the e-commerce giant. As The Associated Press pointed out over the weekend, Mr. Trump is misrepresenting Amazon’s record with the United States Postal Service. Could Mr. Tump’s criticism lead to action against Amazon? Gabriel Sherman over at Vanity Fair reports on a few of the ideas being tossed around, including pushing for the Postal Service to renegotiate its contract with Amazon and encouraging “attorneys general in red states to open investigations into Amazon’s business practices.” Wall Street analysts are largely advising investors to ignore the noise. But even if changes were made to sales tax collection, that may end up benefiting Amazon. Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, writes: Elliott Management has acquired a $1 billion stake in Hyundai Motors, Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis.
business/dealbook,Last month, Hyundai simplified its ownership structure. The aim was to resolve the group’s circular shareholdings, which critics have long said give too much power to Hyundai’s controlling Chung family at the expense of shareholders, Reuters reported. S.&P. 500 futures are up this morning, suggesting yesterday’s market rout may not continue. And European and Asian markets didn’t fall as sharply as did the U.S.’s. But what’s behind the markets dropping 4 percent so far this year? A couple of ideas: • Washington (and Beijing), again: China’s tougher-than-expected retaliatory tariffs gave investors more reason to fear a trade war. American pork and fruit producers are among those sweating. “The Trump administration’s unorthodox and unpredictable decision-making is likely to keep markets on edge,” Mike Ryan of UBS Wealth Management told the FT. • Tech, again: The FAANG stocks are still weighing down the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq, as the likes of Facebook and Google face the prospect of greater regulation and President Trump repeats his attacks on Amazon. (Tesla was down, too, but that’s more understandable.) • Technical issues: Traders could be trimming bull market bets. Peter Eavis’s take: Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market’s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Analysts expect S.&P. 500 companies’ earnings to grow 25 percent this year. But rising interest rates worldwide could affect revenue growth. And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected, profit margins could get squeezed.
business/dealbook,The bottom line: Uncertainty has descended upon the markets, and it will be hard to shake off. In his latest column, Andrew suggests a way the company could make its practices more transparent — one that Google and Amazon could consider, while we’re at it: a button next to every ad and piece of content that would explain why a user is seeing it. More from Andrew: Also: Mark Zuckerberg just mused about greater transparency to Vox, and suggested an independent appeals process to review content on Facebook. Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller, wants him out as Facebook’s chairman. And why Southeast Asia, Facebook’s fastest-growing market, poses it unique problems.

business/dealbook,In offering to buy Sky News outright, Walt Disney is hoping to finally win regulatory approval for Fox’s bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t already own. (Fox itself has proposed making Sky News fully separate, giving it an independent board and funding it for 15 years.) The bottom line: Disney wants Fox to have full control of Sky to support its $52.4 billion deal to buy most of Fox, and it wants to get ahead of Comcast’s rival effort to buy that 39 percent of the British broadcaster.

learning/lesson-plans,22 Ways to Teach and Learn About Poetry With The New York Times - The New York Times We go hard for National Poetry Month here on The Learning Network, so you may already be familiar with an earlier version of this piece we started way back in 2010. But, as The Times kept publishing news and features about poetry and poets, we kept adding more and more ways to teach it, until that old piece started to look downright overstuffed. Below is a fresh version we created in 2017 and have updated in 2018, with over 20 ideas for helping even the most verse averse find something to enjoy. _________ This December 2015 piece asks well-known people like John Green, Shonda Rhimes, Alan Cumming and Stephen King, “What’s Your Favorite Poem?” and links to answers from Yeats to Gwendolyn Brooks. Ask your students to find a favorite poem and write or talk about what it means to them. For more inspiration, they might visit The Favorite Poem Project and watch videos like this one: _________ It’s easy: Just “find” some poetry in a Times article — any Times article, published at any point in our 167-year history. Here are all the rules and guidelines, and here is a related lesson plan written by two teachers whose students post some of our favorite work year after year. Consider it an exercise in close-reading: The task of creating a found poem demands that students examine a piece with enough attention to detail to be able to choose resonant words and phrases and use them to create something new.
learning/lesson-plans,That’s why teachers across the curriculum have participated in the past, and we’ve had science-themed poems on the cosmos and fruit flies; current-events-focused work on topics like the Syrian refugee crisis and the Boston Marathon bombing; and history-steeped poems that use archival reporting on events like the sinking of the Titanic and World War II. To inspire your students, have them read the work of some past winners, like “Amy,” by Epiphany Jones. She “found” her words in a 2011 obituary, “Amy Winehouse, British Soul Singer With a Troubled Life, Dies at 27,” and a 2007 article on the singer, “Disillusioned Diva With Glimmers of Soul.” What can your students make? It only takes one great Times article to participate. ________ In 2014, The Times challenged readers to create “blackout poems” by redacting words from Times articles. Here are the results, and you can use the same tool to make your own. But since the feature only allows participants a few articles to choose from, you might use it as a warm-up for the Found Poem Challenge. After students have experimented, have them choose their own article and unearth a poem in it the same way. _________ You may already be familiar with our weekly “What’s Going On in This Picture” photojournalism exercise. Well, in 2016, we experimented with a live, moderated “What’s Going On in This Poem?” discussion, using the same three questions we apply weekly to photos. This time, though, we asked participants about “Taking It Home to Jerome,” a poem from the Magazine’s weekly column:
learning/lesson-plans,• What’s going on in this poem? • What do you see, or read, that makes you say that? • What more can you find? Follow the whole discussion here to see how those three simple questions opened up a world of possibilities. Then, perhaps, try it yourself. _________ In 2016, as the National Museum of African-American History and Culture first opened, The Times ran Langston Hughes’s poem “I, Too” by itself on a full page of the print paper. Two people who worked on the design explain why in this piece. As the art director says, “Langston Hughes’s words are so powerful, there was no need for design adornment. In this case, less proves to be more.” If The Times were to give over another whole page to a poem right now, what should it be and why? _________ Room for Debate once challenged seven experts to debate this question, and some of the answers are a kind of poetry in themselves. Elsewhere in the Opinion section, William Logan asks, “Poetry: Who Needs It?” and, in “A Poet’s Boyhood at the Burning Crossroads,” Saeed Jones writes about how, as a teenager, poetry helped him “shatter silence into language.” Finally, your students might be familiar with popular “Instapoets” like Rupi Kaur, who lean to aphoristic, confessional and inspirational verse, often brief enough to fit into a tweet, or to be overlaid on a photo or an illustration. Is this “greeting-card verse” or real poetry? Why?
learning/lesson-plans,Have your students read any or all of these, then debate the question in your classroom: Does poetry matter? _________ From 2010 to 2016 we ran a regular feature we called Poetry Pairings. In each, we matched a poem selected by the Poetry Foundation with an article from The Times that in some way echoed, extended or challenged the poem’s words and themes. You can find the full collection here, and use our related Teaching and Learning Ideas For Any Poetry-News Pairing with any of them. After reading a few, challenge your students to do what we did: match a poem to a piece from The Times, or any other news source. How does reading them together deepen and broaden them both? _________ T Magazine regularly takes a never-before-published poem and pairs it with a newly commissioned work of contemporary art — bringing aesthetic life to the written word. For instance, the photo above, by the artist Christian Marclay, is in response to a poem called “Greece” by Billy Collins. Find them both here, then invite your students to scroll through the full collection for inspiration to create their own. _________ In “Galaxies in His Head,” Stephen Burt writes about the poet Terrance Hayes and how he “uses poetry to show that there is more to him, and to anyone, than what you expect.” Watch the video above and read the full article. How might your students use poetry to show others that there is more to them than what people expect?
learning/lesson-plans,_________ “Poetry prevents everybody from feeling lonely,” says Nikki Giovanni in this video. “If I had a friend in the hospital, I would read a poem. But then, friends who get married, they read a poem. And then friends who die say, ‘Read this poem at my funeral’ … Poetry is there with us, a part of us. Poetry is something we carry in our hearts.” Challenge students to think about someone they know who might need the gift of a poem. What poem would they give this person, and why? _________ Metaphors are everywhere, points out the Opinion columnist David Brooks. We often use food metaphors to describe the world of ideas and war metaphors to talk about argument. Have students keep a journal for one day in which they record every metaphor they come across in print or speech. Then, have them react to this column, and to thoughts like, “To be aware of metaphors is to be humbled by the complexity of the world, to realize that deep in the undercurrents of thought there are thousands of lenses popping up between us and the world, and that we’re surrounded at all times by what Steven Pinker of Harvard once called ‘pedestrian poetry.’ ” Then, invite them to see how one young writer — Amanda Gorman, the national youth poet laureate — uses metaphors in her work, as in “Waiting With the Gourd Moon,” the piece she wrote for Black History Month that the Times has animated, above.
learning/lesson-plans,_________  Read about the Twitter poems created by well-known poets like Billy Collins, Claudia Rankine, Elizabeth Alexander and Robert Pinsky. Then have students visit the hashtags #poetweet or #micropoetry on Twitter to see current examples, and to post their own. Our lesson Less Is More: Using Social Media to Inspire Concise Writing has even more poetry ideas. _________ “When you imagine a poetry reading, the scene that comes to mind probably doesn’t involve battalions of underwear-slinging admirers,” begins a 2011 article about open mike night and poetry slams around New York City. View this related slide show, then invite students to attend a local poetry slam, or watch “Def Poetry Jam.” You might even stage your own classroom, schoolwide or community event. And to convince your students to write, rewrite, edit and polish before their work is ready for the world to hear, share with them “Poetry in Action.” In this feature, six contemporary writers, like Billy Collins and Jenny Zhang, share images of their own poems-in-process and discuss the revisions they made. _________ Poetry Magazine celebrated its 100th year in print in 2012, and one thing keeping it fresh, this article reports, is poetry apps for readers’ smartphones. Above, a 2014 video review of even more poetry apps. How would your students help infuse our smartphone and social-media-obsessed world with poetry in ways guaranteed to intrigue readers their age? _________ Read about some new anthologies of poetry that explore a coming zombie apocalypse, and have students create their own undead-inspired verse, whether via limerick, haiku, or sonnets.
learning/lesson-plans,Are zombies just metaphors for things like capitalism or racism? See what some in the article contend, then find evidence in popular culture for or against that interpretation. _________ • After watching and listening to “Mary Oliver’s Provincetown: A Poet’s Landscape,” or reading “For Wallace Stevens, Hartford as Muse,” or “The Bridge, My Muse,” have students look through personal photographs of favorite places then write poems inspired by them. Host an event in which students read their poems accompanied by a slide show of images. • Or, read about the visual art/poetry collaboration that commemorated life at Chicago’s Cabrini-Green housing project as its last building was demolished. Have students write poems about a place they remember from their own lives, or give them a common topic (something like their current school or the town park). Plan a site-specific event, perhaps a poetry walk through the place, having the poems read, projected on structures, written in chalk on sidewalks, or otherwise displayed. You might also collaborate with dancers, musicians and visual artists to perform or present their related work at the event. _________ Post poems in unexpected places the way David Ellis does with his “driftwood haiku”: For example, students might leave poems around your school — perhaps inspired by these subway poets. Ask students to choose poems they have studied in school or elsewhere (or their own original works), then print and tape them to cafeteria tables, bathroom mirrors, hallway walls, or even write in chalk on campus sidewalks. How do people respond? What can you learn from that?
learning/lesson-plans,You might show students the Everyday Poems for City Sidewalk project in St. Paul, or the Poetry in Motion program in the New York City subway, to get an idea of what kinds of poems work well as public pieces. _________ How can poetry both reflect and transcend the era in which it is written? How can looking at a poem from multiple perspectives illuminate its meaning? These are the questions we pose in a lesson plan inspired by a movie about Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl.” _____ In January 2017 the Opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof invited readers to enter his Donald Trump poetry contest. As he wrote: Two thousand submissions later, he published the results, which included this one: Whatever your take on politics right now, read Mr. Kristof’s full column to find more verse — like one from Amit Majmudar, the poet laureate of Ohio, who submitted a poem about his mother becoming a U.S. citizen. How might your students use poetry to express their reactions to what is happening in the world today? What published poetry can they find that helps them make sense of it? _________ The author Adam Bradley is quoted in this book review as calling hip-hop “the most widely disseminated poetry in the history of the world” and noting that rap “is poetry, but its popularity relies in part on people not recognizing it as such.” Do your students agree?
learning/lesson-plans,Host a debate in which students pit poetry against rap or other lyrics. Do lyrics need to be well-crafted for a song to be good? Can lyrics be considered poetry? Why or why not? Should both forms be held to the same artistic standards? To extend the activity, you might have musically inclined students set poems they have studied in school to music — and read lyrics aloud without musical accompaniment. Or, use our lesson plan on Jay-Z’s writing process to find many more ideas. _________ Have students choose a poem they will learn by heart and recite. Find tips to transform this potentially daunting task into a meaningful experience (and one students may look forward to repeating) in our lesson plan, By Heart. You might see what other students have chosen by reading responses to a 2011 Student Opinion question, What Would You Like to Have Memorized? And if they need inspiration,the Op-Ed “Memorize That Poem!” should do the trick. In it, one writer explains why everyone should memorize a bit of poetry as “a lifeline — to grapple with overwhelming emotion or preserve sanity,” as well as to “find your kindred spirits across the centuries.” _________ Poems are the only form of education to which girls like Meena Muska have access: Invite students to read this piece to understand the power of verse in a place where poetry has “long been a form of rebellion for Afghan women, belying the notion that they are submissive or defeated.”
learning/lesson-plans,What other powerful poems of rebellion and resilience can they find? _________ Do you teach poetry with a Times article or feature? Let us know.

climate,How a Coal Baron’s Wish List Became President Trump’s To-Do List - The New York Times Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — President Trump’s first year in office has been a boon for the coal industry, with the Trump administration rolling back regulations on coal-fired power plants and withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate change agreement. Environmentalists have expressed alarm at the new direction, and have complained that Mr. Trump was following a blueprint from the coal industry. A confidential memo written by the head of the country’s largest coal mining company suggests they might not be wrong. The memo was written by Robert E. Murray, a longtime Trump supporter who donated $300,000 to the president’s inauguration. In it, Mr. Murray, the head of Murray Energy, presented Mr. Trump with a wish list of environmental rollbacks just weeks after the inauguration. Nearly a year later, the White House and federal agencies have completed or are on track to fulfill most of the 16 detailed requests, even with Monday’s decision by federal regulators to reject a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants. The March 1 memo, which was obtained by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and shared with The New York Times, is addressed to Vice President Mike Pence. The sweeping wish list of regulatory overhauls includes ending regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and ozone and mine safety, as well as cutting the staff of the Environmental Protection Agency “at least in half” and overhauling the Labor Department’s office of mine safety.
climate,“I give President Trump and his administration credit for being bold, being passionate and being correct in addressing a lot of these issues that were on my list here,” Mr. Murray said in an interview Tuesday. Photographs of portions of a different memo, dated March 23 and addressed to Rick Perry, the secretary of the Department of Energy, were obtained by the magazine In These Times last year. They were taken during a meeting Mr. Murray held on March 29 with Mr. Perry and others at the Energy Department, according to the magazine. Mr. Murray on Tuesday described the memos as very similar. The March 1 “Action Plan for the Administration of President Donald J. Trump” is aimed, Mr. Murray wrote in the memo, at “getting America’s coal miners back to work.” He also asks the federal government to cut funding for carbon capture and sequestration technology — which Mr. Murray called “a pseudonym for ‘no coal’” — and eliminate a 2009 E.P.A. ruling known as the endangerment finding that was the legal justification for much of the Obama administration’s climate change policy. “This list was to remain private, a list of things that needed to be done for reliable, low-cost electricity in America. That was my number one goal here, was to give guidance to the administration in an area that I have observed over 60 years,” Mr. Murray said.
climate,Critics say Mr. Murray’s list and the apparent ease with which he was able to get it in front of cabinet officials and others illustrates the open-door access the Trump administration has offered energy and other industries as it moves to redirect and weaken federal regulations. “The astonishing presumption of this list,” Mr. Whitehouse, a Democrat, said. “It’s an extraordinary arrogance of the fossil fuel industry based on the power they wield in Washington, D.C.” He said even though Mr. Murray had bragged about the action plan on a Frontline documentary last year, the Energy Department had declined his requests to immediately release the memo. “The power of the fossil fuel industry around here is so great I think the industry feels they can count on simply not complying with requests,” Mr. Whitehouse said. The Energy Department did not respond to a request to discuss the memos from Mr. Murray. The Trump administration has had an unusually close relationship with Mr. Murray. He and 10 of his miners were invited to watch the president sign an executive order to rollback President Obama’s climate change regulations. He has met with Mr. Perry to discuss the needs of coal producers. His longtime attorney, Andrew Wheeler, is awaiting Senate confirmation to the No. 2 slot at the E.P.A., and David Zatezalo, the nation’s new top mine safety and health regulator and previously the president of a coal mining company, told his hometown paper that Mr. Murray had encouraged him to put his hat in the ring for the job.
climate,Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell and a deputy administrator of the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush administration, called Mr. Murray’s action plan “an ambitious list.” While interest groups always try to influence policy in a new administration, Mr. Holmstead said Mr. Murray’s status with the administration set him apart. “I really don’t think it’s at all unusual that Murray would have this wish list or a set of recommendations. What makes it different is that it’s pretty clear that he has a personal relationship with the president,” Mr. Holmstead said. “It seems like given Mr. Murray’s relationship with the president that he had more of an expectation that these things were going to be accepted or implemented.” One item not on the list yet important to Mr. Murray was an order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected Monday to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear power plants. Mr. Murray railed against that decision saying it would lead to the decommissioning of coal and nuclear power plants. Environmental groups have accused Mr. Murray of directly asking Mr. Perry for a proposed rule to reward coal and nuclear power plants for providing “grid resiliency.” The March 1 memo does not mention the grid, though photographs of the cover page of the March 23 document to Mr. Perry obtained by In These Times shows its focus is “a plan for achieving reliable and low cost electricity.”
climate,Soon after Mr. Murray’s meeting at D.O.E., Mr. Perry ordered the agency to prepare a study on the country’s electric grid reliability, a precursor to ordering the federal government to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants. Mr. Murray and a spokesman, Gary Broadbent, said the difference between the two memos was that the one provided to Mr. Perry asked the Energy Department to study the security of the nation’s power grid. “I suggested that the study be made,” Mr. Murray said. “What they did from there, the administration did. I did not have involvement in it.” One of the items on the 16-point list was an overhaul of FERC regulators, and the Trump administration accomplished that. But those Trump-appointed commissioners voted against the plan to bail out coal and nuclear. “Obviously they forgot who appointed them right out of the box,” Mr. Murray said.
