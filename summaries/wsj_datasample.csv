["Oil Markets", "Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in the U.S. Gulf Coast late last month before being downgraded to a tropical storm, disrupted around 200,000 barrels a day of crude oil production in August, the report said. The agency expects that figure to rise to 300,000 barrels a day in September. Supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell from a 2017 high in July, by 210,000 barrels a day, to 32.67 million barrels a day, held back by renewed civil unrest in Libya and higher compliance with the cartel\u2019s deal to cut global output. That estimate came out ahead of OPEC\u2019s own forecast, released in the cartel\u2019s monthly oil market report Tuesday.  \n OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, first agreed late last year to cap production at around 1.8 million barrels a day lower than peak October 2016 levels, with the goal of reining in a global oil glut and increasing prices. The deal, extended in May through March 2018, has not had the desired effect on prices, in part due to rising U.S. shale output. Oil prices ticked up Wednesday morning, with Brent crude\u2014the global benchmark\u2014rising 0.5%, to $54.54 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate futures up 0.6%, at $48.52 a barrel. Libya and Nigeria were two OPEC nations exempt from the deal because their industries had been crippled as a result of political instability. But a recent, expected surge in crude production in those two countries\u2014especially in Libya in July\u2014had been undermining the deal\u2019s effectiveness. While Nigerian production continued to drift upwards in August, a spate of oil field shutdowns and pipeline closures by militia groups set output back by 140,000 barrels a day in Libya, according to the IEA."]
["Oil Markets", "At the same time, the OPEC members who are signatories to the output cut deal increased their rate of compliance to 82%, compared with 75% in July, while the non-OPEC participants reached 100% compliance, the agency said. Global supply was also lower the on the back of planned summer maintenance in non-OPEC countries, reducing output by more than 500,000 barrels a day in August, month-on-month. The IEA again raised its growth forecast for global oil demand in 2017, saying it expects demand to increase by 1.6 million barrels a day, up from a July estimate of 1.5 million barrels a day. That uptick should be boosted by Europe and the U.S., even as the aftereffects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hold back American demand in the third quarter. Commercial oil inventories in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a group of industrialized, oil-consuming nations\u2014stayed flat in July month-on-month, at 3.016 million barrels, about a 190 million barrels above OPEC\u2019s target of the last five-year average.

["Economic Data", "The economic euphoria has also been buoyed by strong economic growth, low unemployment, and rising wealth related to repeated stock-market highs and rising property values. Uncertainty surrounding the recently passed tax-overhaul bill pushed sentiment lower in the initial January reading, but appears to have subsided. \u201cStock-price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers,\u201d said Richard Curtin,  the survey\u2019s chief economist. \u201cConsumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes.\u201d Now, consumers have ramped up spending and borrowing in recent months. Spending expanded at a 3.8% annual rate in the fourth quarter, and household debt has risen to $15.1 trillion in 2017\u2019s third quarter from $13.4 trillion in 2011. \u201cThe motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets,\u201d Mr. Curtin said. This booming spending, coupled with accelerating wage growth and higher inflation expectations, could cause inflation to balloon. In January, consumers anticipated a slightly higher long-term inflation rate of 2.5%, up from 2.4% in December. This change is important to Federal Reserve officials as they monitor ramped-up price increases to make decisions that control the flow of money. The Fed\u2019s monetary \u201cpolicy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u2019 decadelong experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses,\u201d Mr. Curtin said.

WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Finance Committee Republicans, who began debate Monday on a major tax overhaul, must make significant revisions to their proposals in the days ahead to stay within rules preventing long-run budget deficits. As written, the Senate Republican tax bill doesn\u2019t comply with what is known as \u201cthe Byrd Rule,\u201d which prevents the Senate from passing tax and spending measures on simple majority votes if they increase budget deficits beyond 10 years. \u201cIt literally cannot pass the Senate. It\u2019s against the rules unless they have 60 votes,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget."]
["Politics and Policy", "Republicans haven\u2019t said how they plan to change the bill to comply with the Byrd Rule. The most likely scenario is setting many of the tax cuts to expire after 2027, at the end of the decadelong budgeting period. It may take more than that. The committee debate is expected to run through the week, paving the way for full Senate consideration after Thanksgiving. The full House is expected to vote on its tax bill this week. The Senate plan cuts taxes by nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade; the rules require it avoid adding to deficits beyond that. Revenue losses are smallest in 2024, at $116.5 billion, and that number grows to $216.7 billion by 2027. That pattern suggests that the bill\u2019s effects beyond 2027 would not comply with the Byrd Rule. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) included a placeholder amendment in the bill that says only that it would bring the bill \u201cinto compliance\u201d with the Byrd Rule. In his opening statement at Monday\u2019s committee session, Mr. Hatch said Republicans are \u201caware of this problem\u201d and are trying to address it.  \u201cThere\u2019s no real cause for concern at this point,\u201d he said, adding that Republicans \u201chave every intention\u201d of making the bill\u2019s business-tax cuts \u201cpermanent,\u201d which suggests that some individual breaks might be temporary. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the panel, said he expected Republicans to produce a \u201ccontortion\u201d that fits the budget rules and \u201cstill keep their main objective, which is this multi-trillion-dollar break for the multinationals.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "Senate Republicans are bound to the Byrd Rule because they are following a fast-track process known as reconciliation. Under reconciliation, they can pass a tax bill on simple majority votes in the House and Senate. Otherwise, they would need to attract Democratic votes that are unlikely. The fast-track reconciliation process is especially important in the Senate, where Republicans have 52 seats. But reconciliation comes with strictures, designed as a way to prevent the Senate from using the procedures repeatedly. Ordinary rules entail lengthy debate and require 60 votes to cut it off. Congress created the Byrd Rule in 1985 at the behest of the late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and it made it part of permanent law in a 1990 budget legislation signed by President George H.W. Bush. Mr. Byrd was concerned that the fast-track procedures under reconciliation were being stretched too far.  \u201cIt\u2019s in the interest of a sufficient number of senators to keep the reconciliation process somewhat constrained,\u201d said Molly Reynolds, a Brookings Institution fellow who has written a book about limits on Senate filibusters. \u201cIf we eliminated the Byrd Rule, that would open up the reconciliation process to a much broader set of policy changes.\u201d Under the rule, reconciliation bills must be primarily fiscal, stay within a set budget and avoid deficits beyond the budget window. That is why President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 were set to expire, though most were later extended by bipartisan majorities."]
["Politics and Policy", "Republicans have been unclear about how they might change the bill. Making business tax cuts temporary would undermine their argument that tax cuts are needed to spur growth. Economists say companies are most responsive to permanent changes in the tax code rather than temporary changes. At the same time, making individual tax cuts temporary could prove politically unpopular. Simple expirations might not necessarily work, because the bill might still have effects after 2027. No single change would be enough to make the bill comply with the rule, Mr. Goldwein said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real legitimate policy around having that much of the bill expire,\u201c he said. \u201dYou would just be gambling on the assumption that some future Congress will want to continue it.\u201d That, he said, means the bill\u2019s ultimate cost would be more than advertised.

Dr. Nedd said he didn\u2019t bring his weapon to church this Sunday, but plans to in the future. One week after a shooting at a Texas church left 26 dead and 20 more wounded, congregations gathering for worship around the country Sunday once again faced the question of security. Long the last frontier where many gun owners went unarmed, the faithful are now\u00a0considering whether they should bring firearms to their houses of worship as well. Many who live near Sutherland Springs, Texas, where last week\u2019s shooting took place, said they didn\u2019t bring their weapons into their houses of worship.  Tomie Barker,  who attends Christ Lutheran Church of Elm Creek in Seguin, Texas, about 15 miles north of Sutherland Springs, said her husband didn\u2019t have the firearm he is licensed to carry on him last Sunday when their church was locked down following the shooting at the nearby First Baptist Church.\u00a0But, she said, he planned to have it with him\u00a0this Sunday. \u201cWhy would we take a gun to church?

Since 2012, there have been at least a dozen deadly shootings at houses of worship. Churches, synagogues, mosques and Sikh temples have struggled to balance their desire to provide an open sanctuary for the community with security. In recent years, many houses of worship have installed cameras and hired armed guards.

Representatives from more than 300 churches, large and small, signed up within three days."]
["U.S. News", "With roughly 12,000 attendees at its services every\u00a0Sunday, Prestonwood has armed security guards. Jack Graham,  the church\u2019s pastor, said the church had resisted putting in metal detectors so that the church would continue to feel welcoming, and didn\u2019t allow open carry of firearms for the same reason. He suspects some congregants with concealed-carry permits do bring their firearms. \u201cFrankly, it brings some comfort,\u201d Dr. Graham said of the armed church members. \u201cIf there had been someone with a weapon in that little church, maybe that could have been prevented.\u201d But not every house of worship can afford\u00a0private security. Smaller churches are now considering arming the congregation or clergy. Tambria Read, a schoolteacher and chairwoman of the Sutherland Springs Historical Museum, owns a gun and supports people being able to carry them, but had always preferred to keep firearms out of religious spaces. \u201cI\u2019m not too crazy about guns in church\u2014somebody could take the gun and do something,\u201d said Ms. Read, 59, who sometimes worshiped at the First Baptist Church but wasn\u2019t there last week. \u201cMaybe somebody in a church needs a gun, someone strategic, but not everybody in a pew.\u201d St. Alban\u2019s Anglican Church in Pine Grove Mills, Pa., where Dr. Nedd is rector, has roughly 50 members, and no budget for private security. Until several years ago, the church was open 24 hours a day, with no locks on the doors. After a deadly shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., last year, the St. Alban\u2019s congregation discussed security measures. When a newcomer showed up, everyone eyed him warily. Dr. Nedd considered bringing his gun, but decided against it."]

A detailed picture, including myriad justifications for shutdown exceptions, had come from hundreds of pages of plans updated by federal agencies in 2017 and published online.  The director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney,  said Friday that his agency intended to manage the shutdown across the federal government differently from the approach taken by former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2013. \u201cWe are going to manage the shutdown differently; we are not going to weaponize it,\u201d said Mr. Mulvaney, who in 2013 was among congressional Republicans accusing Mr. Obama\u2019s Democratic administration of closing popular elements of government, such as national monuments, to turn public opinion against the GOP. Senior administration officials said Friday night they had sought to apply \u201cflexibility\u201d to shutdown rules."]

["Politics and Policy", "If the government shuts down again, people who need a new or replacement social-security card will have to wait. The National Gallery of Art and Smithsonian museums have enough money to stay open Saturday and Sunday and would close thereafter. Some federally produced economic reports won\u2019t be released. At the Internal Revenue Service, 43.5% of employees would continue working, a higher percentage than during the tax agency\u2019s less-busy months. The individual income tax filing season is scheduled to start Jan. 29.  Criminal investigations would continue, as would tax collections. But the IRS would halt most audits and wouldn\u2019t issue refunds, according to the agency\u2019s shutdown plan. The agency is also developing regulations to implement the tax law that Mr. Trump signed in December, but many IRS lawyers aren\u2019t considered essential personnel.  The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is planning to keep five presidential appointees, one administrative judge, two employees and a computer expert on the job in case of an emergency, telling everyone else to stay home. And while payments to physicians treating older people in the Medicare program will continue, about half of the Department of Health and Human Services staff would be furloughed, the agency said.

["Politics and Policy", "But the NIH would be unable to accept new patients, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could be unable to maintain its seasonal flu program and most Food and Drug Administration safety activities would have to stop. Senior administration officials late Friday said that it wasn\u2019t the case that flu activities would be suspended. After the shutdown in October 2013, many federal workers now know the drill: Report to work for four hours of the first working day of a shutdown to learn whether they are subject to furloughs or considered exempt, put up \u201cout of office\u201d notices, secure property and tie up loose ends for an indefinite period. And unlike past shutdowns, federal workers can now readily access detailed guides from the Office of Personnel Management explaining that in some states they can file for unemployment compensation while going without paychecks, but will have to pay it back if they are awarded back pay, which Congress authorized in 2013. At a White House briefing Friday Mr. Mulvaney didn\u2019t say whether he supported giving federal workers, both those furloughed and those who work during the shutdown, back pay at the eventual end of the shutdown. Some congressional Democrats said they were not confident that Congress could work out a deal to authorize it.  Rep.

One unintended consequence: Banks, the biggest holders of Chinese bonds, are now increasingly selling down their bondholdings to boost liquidity. That has pushed up yields in the market, which makes bond issuance more expensive for companies."]
["Credit Markets", "When Hengtong Group Co. Ltd., a manufacturer of fiber-optic cables, sought to issue a one-year bond this March, it discovered that it would have to pay 5.7% a year to raise 600 million yuan ($87 million), much higher than the 4.35% interest rate banks were charging for loans. The Suzhou-based company canceled the issue that was supposed to go toward paying off maturing bank loans. \u201cThe price was too high,\u201d said L\u00fc Zhigang, who oversees Hengtong\u2019s fundraising. He said the company consulted a number of brokerages and analysts, and got a verdict: \u201cThis year isn\u2019t a good time to issue bonds.\u201d Mr. L\u00fc said the firm would use its existing funds to pay off the bank loans, due at various stages this year, and consider issuing bonds with longer maturities. In the first quarter, 130 companies dropped or delayed 119.95 billion yuan ($17.4 billion) in bond-issuance plans, the highest amount for the quarter since 2014, according to database Wind Information Co. Many of the firms -- which span industries from tourism to electronics and construction -- attributed the cancellations to \u201crecent changes in the market\u201d or \u201cmarket volatility.\u201d Overall bond issuance in the quarter dropped 38.5% from a year earlier. The retreat by Chinese companies is a setback for Beijing, which has pledged to give market forces a bigger role in the economy. One of the most important financial reforms in recent years was opening up the mainland bond market to global investors."]
["Credit Markets", "\u201cThe government wants more direct financing,\u201d where institutional investors rather than the government determines debt issuance, said Larry Hu,  an economist at\n            Macquarie Group\n Ltd.\n At $9.6 trillion, China\u2019s bond market is the world\u2019s third largest. Nonetheless, bonds make up only 17% of China\u2019s total social financing, a broader measurement of credit in the economy that includes nonbank debt, compared with 70% for bank loans. In Europe, a dependence on bank lending led to credit crunches during the financial crisis. Policy makers have since tried to expand the corporate bond market. Chinese regulators haven\u2019t yet experienced a crisis of that magnitude, though the latest bond hiccups are a reminder of the challenge for authorities in maintaining stability while reining in debt levels. The recent flight from bond issuance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a credit squeeze. An overwhelming majority of companies seeking to tap the Chinese bond market are state-owned, with access to alternative funding channels. People familiar with two state-owned firms that canceled issues\u2014Weifang Binhai Tourism Group Co. Ltd. and Fujian Electronics and Information (Group) Co. Ltd.--said that higher-than-expected rates prompted the cancellations, but the firms weren\u2019t suffering from a funding shortage. After canceling a February issue, Fujian Electronics issued a bond at the end of March on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, as liquidity eased slightly. But in ailing sectors, such as coal and steel, the higher bond costs mean even state firms might face funding pressures, according to analysts and underwriters. "]
["Credit Markets", "Economists expect costs for issuers in China\u2019s bond market to remain high this year, as central-bank Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan has signaled a tighter hold on credit to avoid fueling asset bubbles and help companies reduce debt.   An investment banker at a Chinese securities firm said that the higher bond costs are pushing some firms to choose debt instruments with maturities of less than one year, a strategy that means frequent and costly rollovers for firms with longer-term funding needs. Earlier this month, Chinese regulators barred companies from using lower-rated corporate bonds as collateral for borrowing short-term cash, a move that further reduces the bond market\u2019s appeal.  The central bank is also trying to get banks to curb speculative activity, such as wealth-management products that are invested in bonds and don\u2019t appear on the banks\u2019 books. That amounts to another tightening on banks\u2019 liquidity.  Defaults in China\u2019s bond market have been rare but are an increasing worry for investors. Eight Chinese companies have defaulted on their bonds so far this year, down from 11 in the same period last year but well above just three in the 2015 period. Foreign investment in China\u2019s bond market is meager at less than 2%, with demand for corporate bonds virtually zero. Arthur Lau, a bond-fund manager at PineBridge Investments, said his firm recommends investors stick with government and policy bank bonds in China, as defaults in corporate bonds will likely rise. "]

["Technology", "Twitter\u2019s decision marks a stark change in company practice. The RT\u2019s editor in chief said in a tweet on Thursday that Twitter approached RT ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election to pitch ways RT could advertise on the service during that stretch. Commenting on the interactions between RT and Twitter, a person familiar with the matter said it is the job of any advertising sales team to aggressively recruit and retain clients.  \u201cWe did not come to this decision lightly,\u201d Twitter said in a statement. In the latest quarter, Twitter realized that it had been mistakenly including users of a service for third-party apps in the company\u2019s tally of monthly users, a spokeswoman said. Twitter restated its user counts for the past three quarters\u2014revising them down by one million to two million\u2014but said it didn\u2019t have user data going back further than that. Twitter in the third quarter added four million monthly users\u2014analysts were expecting just over one million\u2014bringing its total to 330 million monthly users. For the second quarter, however, the adjusted numbers showed the company\u2019s tally actually shrank for likely the first time since 2015, by one million users. Previously Twitter had said user growth was flat in the second quarter. Revenue in the third quarter declined 4.2% from a year earlier to $590 million. Analysts were expecting $587 million, according to FactSet.  Twitter has posted a string of quarterly losses as a public company, but its latest, $21.1 million, was the smallest and compared with $103 million in last year\u2019s third quarter."]
["Technology", "\u201cOur work to increase relevance and make Twitter easier is making an impact,\u201d Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company\u2019s earnings call. Mr. Dorsey attributed the user growth in the latest quarter to improvements made to the company\u2019s short-messaging service in the period, noting that Twitter is focusing increasingly on personalizing the content that appears in users\u2019 feeds. For years, content in the timeline was listed chronologically without algorithmic tweaks, but now the company is expanding its team of artificial intelligence specialists responsible for identifying new content that users might want to see.  \u201cWe\u2019re hiring, and we continue to look for leadership in all these areas,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. Twitter\u2019s error in counting users threatens the company\u2019s credibility during a critical period. The growth of\n            Snap\n Inc.\u2019s\n      Snapchat has increased competition for advertising dollars between the social-media rivals. Meanwhile, Twitter is facing scrutiny on multiple fronts for how it handles problem accounts on its network, including people posting abusive content and alleged Russian manipulation. \u201cIt really is make-or-break time for Twitter,\u201d said Jim Cridlin,  global head of innovation at Mindshare, a unit of ad-agency giant\n            WPP\n            \n      PLC."]
["Technology", "Twitter said the error in counting monthly users didn\u2019t impact its measure of daily users, which grew 14% in the quarter. Twitter doesn\u2019t disclose its raw number of daily users, but said fewer than half of its 330 million monthly users log on daily. The service that erroneously counted the monthly users, Digits, allowed people to log into other apps using their credentials from Twitter.\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\u2019s\n      Google bought Digits from Twitter earlier this year as a part of a larger acquisition of developer tools. The Twitter spokeswoman said the company believes the impact of the error was smaller before this year because Digits had fewer users. Twitter said it doesn\u2019t have the data to reconcile its user figures going back further than the end of 2016 because of its retention policies for certain kinds of information. For the fourth quarter, Twitter projected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of between $220 million and $240 million\u2014a more ambitious target than the $197 million analysts expect, according to FactSet. If Twitter hits the high end of that range, it could record its first quarterly profit since going public in late 2013, the spokeswoman said.

["Politics and Policy", "In a dramatic day at the Capitol, Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 tie, allowing Senate Republicans to clear a procedural hurdle and setting up a days-long stretch of debate and amendment votes on the GOP effort to dismantle and replace much of former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 Affordable Care Act. The two GOP defections came from Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who joined all Senate Democrats in voting against proceeding to debate the legislation. The vote, punctuated by an emotional last-minute appearance by Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who was diagnosed recently with brain cancer, delivered a come-from-behind victory for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who persuaded Republicans skeptical of the GOP bill to band together long enough to begin debate. Mr. Trump said after the vote that his party had taken \u201ca big step\u201d that would \u201cmove forward to truly great health care.\u201d  Even with their surprise win on the procedural motion, which seemed a long shot just last week, Republicans were subdued Tuesday about their prospects of passing a sweeping overhaul of the ACA by week\u2019s end. \u201cWe knew this wasn\u2019t going to be easy, and there\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate GOP leadership."]
["Politics and Policy", "On Tuesday night, the first of Senate leaders\u2019 health-care options, a bill toppling and replacing major portions of the ACA, gained only 43 votes to 57 against. That measure included a much-debated proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) allowing insurers who offer one ACA-compliant health plan to also sell cheaper insurance options that don\u2019t meet ACA rules.  Senate leaders had expected the measure to fail, as Senate rules made it ineligible to pass on a simple majority vote. But the defection of nine GOP Senators\u2014enough to sink the bill even under a simple majority\u2014underscored the lack of support within the party for the ACA replacement that leaders had cobbled together. On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to take up a separate bill that would largely repeal the ACA with a two-year expiration date, to give lawmakers time to craft a replacement.  The Senate debate will culminate later this week in a marathon session of amendment votes, but it isn\u2019t clear GOP leaders have the 50 votes needed to pass any of the proposals, fueling the uncertainty over where the week\u2019s legislative twists will end. Democrats said that while the ACA can be improved, it has provided health insurance to 20 million Americans, and it should be built upon rather than dismantled. Many Republicans say it has resulted in higher premiums and less choice, and that an entirely new approach is needed."]
["Politics and Policy", "In a memorable moment on the Senate floor, Mr. McCain criticized the GOP\u2019s legislative effort, despite flying across the country to prevent the procedural motion from falling short due to his absence. He delivered a sobering rebuke to GOP leaders, even while agreeing that they should at least begin debate on the health legislation. Senators issued their final pleas on Tuesday and ultimately voted on a motion that would allow lawmakers to begin formal debate over a new health-care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. Photo: Getty \u201cIt\u2019s a shell of a bill right now,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it\u2019s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don\u2019t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Mr. McConnell on Tuesday pitched GOP senators on a backup proposal, if they can\u2019t agree on any other plans for repealing and possibly replacing the ACA. Under this \u201clowest common denominator\u201d proposal, Republicans would cobble together just the elements that they all agree on, including repealing the individual and employer mandates and a tax on medical devices."]
["Politics and Policy", "That would knock down the most controversial elements of the ACA, including the requirement that most people pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have insurance. But it would likely increase the number of people without insurance, compared with the ACA, making it a potentially hard sell for centrist senators. But centrists may like the fact that it would leave the Medicaid program for low-income Americans unchanged, unlike the current bill\u2019s $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we get to in the end,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.). \u201cThey\u2019re going to see what the broadest measure is that they can get people to support.\u201d GOP leaders hope that passing just a scaled-back bill as a default would at least start negotiations with House Republicans over their version of a health overhaul, which passed in May, keeping alive the effort to repeal the ACA. It could also provide the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office more time, while those negotiations are under way, to provide an estimate of the cost and coverage impact of some Republican proposals that could be incorporated into the legislation. Those measures include an additional $100 billion so states can assist people who lose Medicaid coverage due to the Republican bill, as well as a proposal to allow insurers to sell less expensive plans with fewer benefits if they also sell more robust plans. Still, it isn\u2019t clear Republicans can secure 50 GOP votes for the scaled-back repeal plan. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) called the proposal a \u201cpolitical punt,\u201d and other senators uneasy over the bill could also emerge as opponents."]
["Politics and Policy", "Many Republicans said opening debate was a good first step, while generally being cautious about the path ahead.  \u201cThis vote is the first step toward solving the problems created by Obamacare,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.). \u201cAnd as the Senate continues to deliberate, I will be carefully monitoring any legislative changes that are proposed. It\u2019s important we get this right.\u201d Democrats said the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d strategy exposed Republicans\u2019 difficulties in coalescing around a health-care plan, despite promising voters for seven years they would repeal the ACA as soon as they took power in Washington. \u201cIt shows the bankruptcy of Republicans\u2019 policy efforts,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), calling the plan \u201ca naked political move to get it off the floor of the Senate\u201d that \u201cdoes nothing to move us closer to actually addressing the health-care needs of Americans.\u201d The vote to proceed to debate was somewhat dramatic, in part because the outcome wasn\u2019t entirely certain when it began. When Sens. Collins and Murkowski voted no, it became clear that just one more defection would end the GOP health overhaul push for now. Mr. McCain\u2019s plane from Arizona was landing in Washington around the same time, and he raced to the Capitol. Meanwhile, Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), who hasn\u2019t always seen eye-to-eye with GOP leaders, withheld his vote until the last minute, engaging in a long talk with Mr. McConnell on the Senate floor.

["Markets Main", "That has left many investors watching for signs of a larger pullback. The potential signals include everything from stocks\u2019 price/earnings ratios to the gap between short- and long-term bond yields. One measure of those indicators suggests investors\u2019 jitters may still be a bit premature. Late last year, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch compiled a set of 19 indicators that have preceded past bear markets, which are unofficially defined as a 20% retreat from the most recent peak. Right now, those signposts suggest that the risk of a downturn is rising but that a reversal isn\u2019t imminent. In the past, bear markets were on the horizon when 80% of those signals\u2014which include rising interest rates, growing consumer confidence, tightening credit conditions and surging market volatility\u2014have been triggered.

["World News", "\u201cWe have found mutual agreement on many important issues,\u201d U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters\u00a0Tuesday.  U.S. officials said they reached broad consensus, but not full agreement, in provisions governing small and medium businesses, services, digital trade and the environment. Mexico\u2019s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said he expects to \u201cstart seeing results in the third round of talks.\u201d  An adverse political backdrop isn\u2019t helping negotiators with a goal of wrapping up talks around the end of the year and submitting a new Nafta for approval in the countries\u2019 congresses and parliament as soon as next year.  President Donald Trump, who made criticism of Nafta a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, recently renewed threats to pull out of the trade agreement, which has bound North American economies through shared commercial rules and duty-free trade for 23 years. Participants in the talks described the meetings\u2014which took place beyond closed doors in an upscale hotel in the Mexican capital\u2014as professional and not unfriendly. Many of the officials have worked together recently on the abortive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the unratified 12-country deal that Mr. Trump exited in January, or in the 1990s on the original Nafta talks. But observers say the public demands and often-unwelcome policy moves from the governments back home are challenging Nafta negotiators, who will need a combination of hard work, flexibility and luck to hammer out a deal that can survive political scrutiny."]
["World News", "Mr. Lighthizer disputed the notion that the political demands are hurting the Nafta talks. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes it any harder at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just shows that it matters.\u201d  Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto addressed Nafta directly on Saturday, telling Mexicans in an annual address that he won\u2019t accept a deal that hurts the country\u2019s \u201cdignity.\u201d Canada\u2019s Liberal government has made it clear that it won\u2019t agree to the numerous demands of the Trump administration without a fight\u2014or without winning \u201cprogressive\u201d new standards on labor and the environment that aren\u2019t likely to be welcomed by Republicans in Washington.  \u201cThere\u2019s no secret that the labor provisions will be contentious,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.  Mr. Guajardo, Mexico\u2019s Economy Minister, noted that labor issues could be among the harder ones to deal with.  But the Trump administration has made the biggest waves, seeking to insert \u201cAmerica first\u201d provisions in the three-country deal, including \u201cbuy American\u201d procurement provisions and U.S. content rules for the auto industry. Mr. Lighthizer said Tuesday that manufacturing workers hurt by Nafta won\u2019t be forgotten. During the Mexico City talks, Trump administration officials said the president is considering starting the process of exiting a five-year-old trade pact with South Korea as early as Tuesday. The move didn\u2019t go unnoticed at the Nafta gathering, and some observers saw it as a warning about Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude toward all trade deals."]
["World News", "\u201cIf they\u2019re threatening to withdraw from the Korea agreement in the middle of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula, then you come to the conclusion you\u2019re working with people who don\u2019t want to negotiate,\u201d said Mickey Kantor,  the former U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration who won congressional approval of Nafta. Mr. Lighthizer said Tuesday that the Trump administration would like some amendments to the agreement with South Korea. \u201cMy hope is we\u2019ll have a successful discussion with the Koreans,\u201d he added.  Then just hours before negotiators wrapped up the latest talks, the Trump administration rescinded the Obama administration\u2019s immigration program that has allowed unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country. While Tuesday\u2019s move against \u201cdreamers\u201d by winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program isn\u2019t directly connected to the talks, it could cast a shadow on efforts to strike a deal suitable to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, as Mexico faces presidential elections next year. The Mexican government is \u201cobviously concerned\u201d about the well-being of its nationals, Mr. Guajardo said, but \u201cit\u2019s not an issue that at this moment is technically linked to the negotiations.\u201d  The leftist front-runner in next year\u2019s vote, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,  criticized trade and globalization in a speech Tuesday in Washington at the Wilson Center think tank. \u201cIt is not cheaper to buy from the outside than to produce within our borders,\u201d he said."]
["World News", "Mexico has vowed to defend its citizens\u2019 rights in broader, bilateral talks with the Trump administration, including the labor rights of Mexican migrant workers in the U.S. The Mexican election, along with the U.S. congressional elections next year, has led Washington and Mexico City to push for a Nafta deal by the end of the year, a goal that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also recognized. To achieve that, negotiators will have to accelerate progress in future rounds. U.S. officials are still working with business and labor groups, Congress and government agencies to figure out their exact stance on sensitive issues. The U.S. domestic consultations\u2014on issues including a divisive dispute system that allows investors to challenge governments, and on complicated \u201crules of origin\u201d for determining which products get duty-free treatment in North America\u2014have had the effect of delaying progress in some areas and could also give an opening to Mexico and Canada to get their language to the negotiating table first, a former Canadian official said. \u201cWe all have clearance processes that we have to go through,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. The Trump administration is working to strike a balance domestically between its own efforts to boost U.S. sovereignty and reduce Mexican imports in an updated Nafta and the requirements for getting a deal through a Congress led by Republican lawmakers, which back less controversial updates to the deal.  For any deal reached with Canada and Mexico, \u201cI have to get it through the White House, and then I have to get it through Congress,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said."]

The Apple permit covers three 2015 Lexus sport-utility vehicles, which would be retrofitted with hardware and software to be used in autonomous mode. It also covers six human operators who must sit behind the wheel to monitor the driving and take over when needed, according to the DMV. Apple has been working for years on self-driving cars\u2014an effort dubbed Project Titan\u2014under a thick veil of secrecy. Its first public statements about its car effort came in a November letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering input on planned regulations governing automated vehicles.  Apple CEO Tim Cook discusses where he sees the car industry moving in the future with WSJ\u2019s Editor in Chief Gerard Baker at the WSJDLive conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Originally published Oct. 20, 2015)"]
["Technology", "The revelation of Apple\u2019s interest in self-driving technology in 2015 sent shock waves through the auto industry, which had been working on various research efforts but generally saw autonomous vehicles as a far-off endeavor. The race has intensified since then, with Silicon Valley companies and traditional auto makers vying for position around technology that has the potential to reshape a bedrock in the U.S. economy. A study by Deloitte estimates there is some $2 trillion in annual revenue in the U.S. tied to the auto industry. Silicon Valley\u2019s increasing interest has spurred traditional auto makers around the world to increase their efforts with many claiming they will have self-driving vehicles on the road in the next few years.\n            General Motors\n Co.\n      acquired self-driving-tech startup Cruise Automation last year in an effort to speed up its self-driving efforts, and the auto maker has said it is spending about $150 million per quarter on development.\n            Ford Motor\n Co.\n      , targeting a self-driving vehicle for the market in 2021, is investing $1 billion into Argo AI to help its effort.\n            BMW\n AG\n      has teamed up with\n            Intel\n Corp.\n      to bring out a fully autonomous vehicle as well. "]
["Technology", "An Apple spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the permit and referred to a statement it issued in December, when the letter to regulators became public, that said the company is investing in machine learning and autonomous systems. The letter\u2014which said Apple was making those investments for many purposes \u201cincluding transportation\u201d\u2014suggested Apple was focusing on software that would control a self-driving car. That aligned with other signs that Apple\u2019s car effort had shifted from building a car to designing an autonomous-driving system. Last summer, for instance, Apple eliminated some positions on Project Titan focused on car development and added software-focused staff. Its new approach is a departure for Apple, which typically tries to control both the software and hardware of its products to deliver a uniform user experience, and maximize profits. It is alone among major smartphone developers, for example, in using its own operating-system software instead of Google\u2019s Android system\u2014a strategy widely credited with helping Apple garner more than 90% of profits in the global smartphone industry, according to Strategy Analytics.  Neil Cybart,  who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to Apple analysis, said there could be similar value in controlling both the software and hardware of a car. \u201cOne aspect of the auto industry that needs to change is design and [the company is] well suited with their design philosophy,\u201d he said."]
["Technology", "California has been the major testing ground for autonomous-vehicle technology. Apple rivals have been testing their vehicles on the roads here for some time\u2014especially Waymo LLC, the Google sister company doing self-driving cars. Waymo has been working on autonomous vehicles since 2009 and has driven more than 2.5 million miles on public roads, including 635,868 last year in California, according to a report filed with the state.  \u201cWe\u2019re still in the first mile of the marathon of this race. At this point, it\u2019s still up in the air who can take the lead,\u201d said Dave Sullivan,  an auto analyst with consultancy AutoPacific Inc. Putting test vehicles on public roads opens Apple to more scrutiny than it is accustomed to when developing products. California requires companies with autonomous-car testing permits to file public reports about their efforts, including crash information and the number of times their human operators have to take over from the computer. Other companies testing self-driving technology in the state\u2014including Waymo, Uber Technologies Inc. and\n            General Motors\n Co.\u2019s\n      Cruise Automation\u2014have put logos on their test vehicles, adding to the attention. It is unclear if Apple\u2019s Lexus vehicles will bear its logo. With the scrutiny of public testing, any glitches can quickly draw unwanted attention. Last month, for instance, an Uber test vehicle crashed with a motorist in Tempe, Ariz., prompting Uber to suspend all such testing briefly even though police said the tech company wasn\u2019t at fault. "]
["Technology", "Uber had previously tried testing its cars in San Francisco without a permit, drawing the ire of California officials. The ride-hailing company pulled its vehicles from its hometown and began testing in Arizona, before deciding to go back and obtain a permit in California. Other companies have expanded road testing from California to other states that offer different weather conditions and challenges\u2014an approach that Apple could follow as it tests its technology. Waymo is currently testing its cars in Kirkland, Wash., Mountain View, Calif., Austin, Texas, and Phoenix.  By 2030, about a quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. may be done through autonomous, electric vehicles, according to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group. Many of the developers that appear furthest along have said commercial fleets, whether it is robot taxis or delivery vehicles, are the most likely way the technology will first be deployed Major questions remain about Apple\u2019s intentions. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they know what their play will be, but they do sense there\u2019s an opportunity and they can bring value to it,\u201d said Ben Bajarin,  an analyst with technology-research firm Creative Strategies. \u201cThe question is: How big is this commitment?

["Markets Main", "Another option the company is considering is to do the IPO in two stages, with a listing on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul exchange in 2019 and an international listing a year later, that person said. An international listing had long been planned for 2018, with New York and London as the leading candidates.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders are weighing these options as they confront the monumental challenge of untangling the world\u2019s biggest oil company from a royal family that has long used it as a piggy bank. The Aramco team devising the IPO has struggled to bring international accounting standards to an oil company that still has a construction unit overseeing soccer stadiums and camel-beauty-pageant facilities. The people familiar with the matter said nothing had been decided and the IPO could still move forward.  In that event, the IPO would be one of the biggest ever, estimated by Saudi officials to be as high as $100 billion. Its proceeds have been pegged for Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund, which would become the world\u2019s largest and would drive a transformation of the kingdom\u2019s economy into something less oil dependent. Aramco\u2019s deep ties to the kingdom and the difficulty of separating it out into an entity that could be sold to investors has long been viewed as an obstacle to the IPO. It also isn\u2019t clear whether public markets would value Aramco at or close to the $2 trillion valuation cited by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,  the kingdom\u2019s heir apparent and champion of the Aramco IPO plan. "]
["Markets Main", "A series of delays, including in deciding where to list the shares, have led to discussions among senior executives about putting off the listing, according to people familiar with those discussions. The Financial Times reported earlier Friday that the company is considering shelving its IPO plans, and is looking instead at investment from the Chinese government. A spokesman for the company, known as Saudi Aramco, said the \u201cIPO process remains on track.\u201d But he said a \u201crange of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review.\u201d The oil company has been preparing since 2015 to sell 5% of its shares on international markets as the centerpiece of a strategy to overhaul the Saudi economy and break its reliance on oil. Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he intends to invest proceeds from the offering in other businesses. Since then Saudi Aramco has consulted with a global team of consultants and banks in an attempt to bring order to a company that had long operated under different rules than big international oil companies like\n            Exxon Mobil\n Corp.\n      It has never reported its quarterly or annual profits and has never faced the kind of legal liability risks that other energy firms do.  The process has given outsiders access to Saudi oil operations kept secret for over three decades since Aramco\u2014once run by American companies\u2014was nationalized in the 1980s. Changing Aramco\u2019s culture enough to publicly list in a venue like New York or London has taken longer than expected, people familiar with the matter said."]
["Markets Main", "A major stumbling block has been the location of the listing. Prince Mohammed has favored New York for its deep pool of investors and prestige, while outside advisers have favored London, which is considering loosening corporate-governance rules to attract Aramco. Hong Kong, Tokyo and Toronto have also been in the mix.  While finance employees are still being told to prepare for the IPO in 2018, a person familiar with their work said so much remains to be done that the listing could be pushed back to 2019. \u201cThere are various aspects of the IPO you cannot really work on if you don\u2019t know where the company wants to list and the pace has definitely slowed down,\u201d a senior Saudi Aramco executive said. \u201cTime is running out for both the IPO teams and the advisers.\u201d In recent months, Saudi Aramco has sought private investors in China, India and Russia, which would bring an infusion of capital without the additional scrutiny of a Western public listing, the people familiar with the matter said. They said that sale could coincide with a listing on Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange, which doesn\u2019t have the same transparency requirements of New York or London.  Despite the uncertainty, Saudi Aramco employees have continued working on various aspects of IPO preparation, including developing a financial-reporting structure that complies with U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley rules, says the person familiar with the matter. The teams work privately and generally don\u2019t communicate with other colleagues about their work in an effort to contain leaks, this person said."]

Mr. Mattis, widely respected for his no-holds-barred battlefield focus, told Mr. Trump during that meeting in December that he didn\u2019t believe torture worked and that he thought the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a critical military alliance that shouldn\u2019t be abandoned.  \u201cIf we did not have NATO today, we would need to create it,\u201d he said at his January confirmation hearing with a Senate panel. Mr. Trump, enamored of Mr. Mattis\u2019s reputation and the name the media conferred upon him years ago, Mad Dog Mattis, was impressed. Within days, the president, while saying he still believed torture worked, deferred to his soon-to-be defense secretary, saying he would allow Mr. Mattis to \u201coverride\u201d him on the issue.  Mr. Trump subsequently has altered his stance on the value of NATO, but maintained that European allies should pay more for collective defense. Mr. Mattis dutifully carried that message to two stops in Europe last week, in Brussels and at a security conference in Munich."]
["National Security", "On other issues, there appears to be more daylight between Mr. Mattis and the president. In Abu Dhabi, asked if the U.S. was interested in seizing Iraqi oil fields, an idea that Mr. Trump had toyed with publicly during the campaign and again at a speech at CIA headquarters the day after his inauguration, Mr. Mattis dismissed the idea. \u201cWe are not in Iraq to seize anybody\u2019s oil,\u201d Mr. Mattis told reporters. Mr. Mattis has also taken a different stance on Russia than Mr. Trump, although there are signs the administration is moving his way. The defense secretary and Mr. Pence have said Russia must be held accountable for its actions in Ukraine and that Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea wouldn\u2019t be recognized. Mr. Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley have also taken a tough line against relaxing sanctions. During his visit to Brussels, Mr. Mattis spoke skeptically about military cooperation with Russia, even as he said political leaders\u2014presumably including Mr. Trump\u2014would engage to find \u201ca way forward.\u201d Mr. Trump, as Mr. Pence noted Monday, continues to believe that more cooperation with Moscow is possible. In his news conference last week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. political climate was poisoning relations with Moscow and \u201cmakes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.\u201d Before he was confirmed, Mr. Mattis was seen as a steady hand who knew the issues and inspired the military. Supporters of his knew he had enough credibility with Mr. Trump that he could act as a buffer, helping to rein in some of the president\u2019s unfiltered ideas while strengthening the fight against Islamic State."]
["National Security", "While more junior-level dissenters have been ushered out, there may be more latitude for the top administration officials. Mr. Pence wasn\u2019t afraid during the campaign to contradict Mr. Trump on policy matters, including relations with Russia. Like Mr. Mattis, Mr. Pence has sought to clarify the administration\u2019s positions in ways that don\u2019t always seem in perfect alignment with the president. While Mr. Trump has been an enthusiastic backer of Britain\u2019s move to leave the European Union, for example, Mr. Pence offered a warm embrace of the EU on Monday. Mr. Pence has also shown a political deft touch. Asked on Monday about the president\u2019s attacks on the media, the vice president embraced freedom of the press but made sure to stay close to the boss. \u201cWhen the media get it wrong,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cI promise you President Trump will take his case straight to the American people to set the record straight.\u201d Mr. Mattis, when he was asked a similar question on Monday, shrugged and told reporters with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with the press.\u201d  Write to Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com and Julian E.

["Markets Main", "\u201cThey\u2019re trying desperately to get foreign capital into the country,\u201d said Chris Balding, associate professor of economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC Business School. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the appetite.\u201d In addition to relieving pressure on the yuan, Beijing also hopes more foreign institutional capital will stabilize Chinese stock markets, which saw a spectacular boom and bust in the summer of 2015.

["Markets Main", "But foreign investors are not exactly pouring in. Net investment in Shenzhen reached no higher than 21% of the daily 13 billion yuan cap on stock purchases on any given day last week.  Overseas flows failed to reach 1% of daily turnover on the Shenzhen market throughout last week. Offshore investors see Shenzhen stocks as pricey, and are turned off by the market\u2019s lack of research. And because the launch has been well flagged for many months, stocks have seen little lift from the opening. \u201cAll of the catalysts have been priced in,\u201d said Frank Tsui,  fund manager of Greater China equities at\n            Value Partners\n            \n      in Hong Kong. At present, only those China stocks listed offshore (principally in Hong Kong and the U.S.) are included in MSCI\u2019s key benchmarks such as its emerging markets index, the most widely tracked gauge of developing market stocks. MSCI has declined to include A-shares three times since 2014, each time pointing to offshore investors\u2019 heavily restricted access to the market. With each market opening, expectations rise that MSCI might now include the stocks in its most tracked benchmarks, the Shenzhen Connect launch being no exception. \u201cWith the Connect, we\u2019re another step closer to MSCI inclusion in the emerging market index,\u201d said Nicole Yuen,  head of greater China equities at\n            Credit Suisse\n.\n"]
["Markets Main", "Elsewhere, China\u2019s government has attempted to attract foreign investors by opening its interbank bond market, where most of the country\u2019s bond trading takes place, allowing unrestricted amounts of buying by foreigners. But take-up so far has also been slack. Few debt managers have a deep knowledge of the onshore bond market, where pricing is distorted by the presumption among local investors that the debt of some firms carries implicit government guarantees, said BNP\u2019s Mr. Sambor. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy for global emerging-market managers\u201d to get set up to trade this market, he added. Even getting access to accurate data means putting aside beloved Bloomberg terminals and learning to use the Chinese counterpart, Wind Information, which is mainly in Chinese. Overseas investors increased their holdings of Chinese bonds to 747.13 billion yuan as at the end of November, compared to 554.2 billion yuan at the start of the year, according to Wind. But that\u2019s a mere crumb compared to the size of the Chinese bond market, with outstanding debt of 63.6 trillion yuan. It\u2019s also done little to halt a sell-off in the past month, which saw yields on 10-year Chinese government bonds hit the highest level in more than a year last week. Meanwhile, the extra yield demanded by investors on corporate bonds over government debt rose to the highest level in almost 18 months."]
["Markets Main", "That said, a slow and steady launch for Shenzhen stocks and bond market trading may be what Beijing wants.

Self hoped for any nugget of wisdom. \u201cHe said, \u2018You better hope Spellman doesn\u2019t shoot the ball well,\u2019\u201d Self recalled. Right on cue, Omari Spellman sank two 3-pointers in the first four minutes of the game. The Wildcats won by 16. "]
["Life & Style", "In other words, 3-point shooting played an integral role in determining which programs survived the madness of March to reach Monday night\u2019s national title game. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Modern basketball revolves around the three, a paradigm shift taking over the professional and college ranks. But this clash between Villanova and Michigan represents the next phase of that movement. Their 3-pointers don\u2019t all originate from the expected sources, dynamic guards in the mold of Stephen Curry and James Harden. Many come from the biggest people on the court, outside-shooting giants who create matchup nightmares for under-equipped defenses. For the Wildcats, that means Spellman, the player who worried Huggins and Self. Spellman stands nearly 6-foot-10, making him the tallest player in Villanova\u2019s primary rotation. He has connected on 44% of his threes this year, the best mark on a team that set a men\u2019s Division I record for 3-pointers made in a single season. The Wolverines\u2019 threat is perhaps even scarier: Moritz Wagner, a 6-foot-11 German with a Dirk Nowitzki-type game, who paces the Wolverines with a 3-point field-goal percentage of about 40%. He scored 24 points and hit two key 3-pointers down the stretch against Loyola-Chicago on Saturday, sealing the victory that sent Michigan to within 40 minutes of its first title since 1989. Lots of teams have players who can shoot threes in 2018. Not many have a big man who can shoot threes. Michigan and Villanova both have one. "]
["Life & Style", "\u201cIt\u2019s invaluable,\u201d Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s the toughest thing to guard.\u201d It\u2019s not difficult to see why. Wagner and Spellman put opposing defenses in a near-impossible quandary: trying to find someone tall enough to stop them from dominating inside but athletic enough to keep them off the 3-point arc. That explains why, at their respective news conferences Sunday, both Wright and Michigan coach John Beilein referenced not Curry as the progressive trendsetter changing the fabric of basketball, but instead another Golden State Warrior: Draymond Green, the 6-foot-7 versatile swingman who often acts as a center in a smaller Warriors lineup\u2014a player, Beilein said, who can \u201cdo everything.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great concept,\u201d Beilein said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we can stop it.\u201d While many big men in America still stick to banging bodies in the post, sharpshooting big men have been big in Europe for years, said Michigan assistant coach DeAndre Haynes, who played on pro teams there from 2006 to 2012.  \u201cEvery big man I think I played with over there, they would shoot the \u20183\u2019 ball,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cThat\u2019s what made the game a little harder over there. You really had to adjust to it.\u201d  Increasingly, American coaches are embracing the advantage of tall shooters. While coaching at West Virginia in the mid-2000s, Beilein had Kevin Pittsnogle, a beefy 6-foot-11 center with 3-point range. Wagner is the natural progression from players like that\u2014\u201cthinned down, eating healthier, a little more skilled,\u201d Wright said."]
["Life & Style", "Omari Spellman of the Villanova Wildcats attempts a jump shot against the West Virginia Mountaineers.Photo: Elsa/Getty Images Players listed at 6-foot-9 or taller made 4,806 3-pointers this season, the most since at least 1996-97, according to data from Stats LLC. That\u2019s almost 1,000 more than last season and close to 2,000 more than five years ago. These taller players\u2019 .342 3-point shooting percentage is the highest in the sport since 2007\u2014when those players attempted 5,700 fewer shots than this season. \u201cYou see it in the NBA, you see it in college,\u201d Haynes said. A lot of guys in high school right now are starting to do it.\u201d No player embodies that idea more than Wagner, who said that despite his height, he wanted to be a guard as a child, so he \u201calways shot threes.\u201d He scored 21 points and made all three of his threes against Texas A&M in the Sweet 16 and then exploded against Loyola. The Ramblers revamped their schemes for Wagner, but nothing worked. When they kept their center on Wagner, he utilized his guard-like quickness and shooting ability. When they switched to a smaller defender, it left the inside open, allowing Wagner to control the glass, resulting in 15 rebounds, including six on the offensive end. Granted, Loyola is smaller and doesn\u2019t have the weapons Villanova has. But even Wildcats guard Phil Booth admitted, \u201cWe never really guard a five-man like Wagner.\u201d"]
["Life & Style", "Then again, Michigan hasn\u2019t seen many big men like Spellman, who lost about 50 pounds after arriving at Villanova last season, enabling him to be a consistent threat from the outside.

["Technology", "On Tuesday, Apple said its fiscal first-quarter sales rose in every region except for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. On a call with investors, Chief Executive Tim Cooksaid there were challenges. It was the fourth consecutive quarter in which Greater China was Apple\u2019s worst-performing region. Apple said its Greater China sales fell 12% to $16.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 14% growth a year earlier.  Its performance in the region dragged Apple\u2019s global sales growth to 3%, despite 9% growth in the Americas. Mr. Cook said that without a currency impact, the drop in mainland China would have been 6%. China\u2019s smartphone boom helped drive Apple\u2019s growth for several years, but now Chinese companies such as Oppo and Huawei Technologies Co. are offering handsets that are cheaper and nearly as sophisticated as iPhones. China\u2019s smartphone market, the world\u2019s largest, is brutally competitive and fickle: When Hugo Barra left Xiaomi Corp. last month to return to Silicon Valley, the company he touted a couple of years ago as China\u2019s next big thing had fallen from first to fourth in the sales rankings.  Apple\u2019s sales in the region were also hampered by the limited visual difference between iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, Counterpoint Research analyst James Yan said. With lower average disposable income than western shoppers, Chinese consumers are less eager to splurge on an expensive new phone that could be mistaken for an older one.  \u201cChinese consumers now have many other options,\u201d Mr. Yan said. "]
["Technology", "At least four homegrown companies are selling more handsets than Apple in China: Oppo, Vivo, Huawei and Xiaomi.  Oppo and sister brand Vivo have climbed to the top of China\u2019s smartphone market by copying a page from\n            Samsung Electronics\n Co.\u2019s\n      playbook, blanketing target markets with soft-lit ads featuring popular celebrities. Oppo\u2019s market share in the third quarter was 17.5% and Vivo\u2019s was 16.7%, according to market research firm IDC. Zhang Dong, a 34-year-old Jinan resident, said he bought a Vivo phone last year because it was a good deal. \u201cApple phones are too expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t buy Vivo, I\u2019ll probably buy Huawei.\u201d Mr. Zhang is the kind of customer that Apple is seeking: Residents of China\u2019s second-tier cities who are currently using domestic brands. Half of Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China consist of first-time buyers or \u201cswitchers\u201d who previously used other brands, Mr. Cook said Tuesday. Huawei reached double-digit market share globally for the first time, accounting for one in 10 smartphones sold in the world-wide in the fourth quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. It is a sign of how competitive China\u2019s smartphone market is that the company once heralded as China\u2019s Apple now ranks fourth. Xiaomi remains a solid contender, though it has been outshone lately by rivals. Just three years ago, it was the country\u2019s leading smartphone vendor with a valuation of $46 billion, making it the world\u2019s most valuable startup at the time."]
["Technology", "Xiaomi shook up China\u2019s smartphone market when it started selling handsets that could compete with iPhones for less than half the cost; the company also used online \u201cfan clubs\u201d to promote purchases. Although it became a niche favorite this way, more traditional companies like Oppo found favor with mainstream consumers by building out vast networks of brick-and-mortar stores where customers could try phones before buying them. Xiaomi now ranks fourth in China\u2019s smartphone market. \u201cThe online channel is reaching its glass ceiling,\u201d said Canalys analyst Nicole Peng. She said Xiaomi needs to focus this year on developing its Chinese sales channels instead of expanding internationally. Last year, Xiaomi said it was putting more effort into traditional retail channels. China remains an important market for Apple, as it contributes 20.7% of its revenue and is the location for the bulk its manufacturing facilities. The logo looms from an Apple store in Beijing last year. Photo: Associated Press Despite its market-share decline in China, analysts say Apple still captures the lion\u2019s share of profits for the sector in the country and globally. World-wide, Apple earned 91% of smartphone operating profits in the third quarter, versus 2.4% for Huawei and 2.2% each for Oppo and Vivo, according to Strategy Analytics.

["Art Review", "While the last Biennale was bleak and overtly political, Ms. Macel\u2019s show is more buoyant. Exhibits fill the red-brick Arsenale shipyard, which has been divided into nine sections under themes with names such as \u201cPavilion of Joys and Fears\u201d and \u201cPavilion of Shamans.\u201d The works include conceptual art, film, photography, video, textiles, sculpture, painting and live performance. You can even bring your clothes to be repaired by Paris-based Taiwanese artist Lee Mingwei,  who attaches them by a string to a wall of colored reels.  Many of the national pavilions ask unsettling questions about the state of the world, in particular the refugee crisis and political oppression. The Tunisian pavilion makes a point by showing no art at all but putting up kiosks where an \u201cofficial\u201d issues \u201cuniversal passports.\u201d In the Russian pavilion the work of several artists is shown, bringing together art, video and sound. Grisha Bruskin has created stark, terrifying landscapes filled with tiny, ghostly sculpted figures. In one, a double-headed eagle looms over a crowd marching with raised fists; in another, lines of faceless soldiers spy through binoculars. Anne Imhof\u2019s installation at the German pavilionPhoto: Giacomo Cosua/NurPhoto/ZUMA Pres Being black, gay and liberal, Mark Bradford at the U.S. pavilion has said he finds himself representing a country that no longer represents him. He\u2019s littered the outside with rubble, and getting past the door you must squeeze around a huge object hanging above your head. He wants you to feel oppressed. You do. "]
["Art Review", "One of the themes of \u201cArte Viva Arte\u201d is the artist\u2019s well-being, so you are greeted at the Arsenale by photographs of Austrian sculptor Franz West having a good nap. This is amusing, but as I continued through the displays of embroideries, woven books, bales of colored wool, hanging sneakers acting as flowerpots, and the like, I began to feel I was at an arts-and-crafts fair. One installation comes perilously close to exploitation: Ernesto Neto\u2019s huge gold-mesh tent where members of a Brazilian rainforest tribe sing and chant. Come and watch the natives!  Vajiko Chachkhiani\u2019s installation in the Georgian pavilion Photo: Getty Images While much of this year\u2019s show is weak, some exhibits left an indelible impression. One is the old wooden house, abandoned in a Georgian mountain village, that Vajiko Chachkhiani has erected here. Through its grimy windows you can make out a table set with plates and glasses; a tin washing bowl decorated with large flowers is placed on a chair near a bed. Indoors, a steady rain pours down over everything. It is beautiful but bleak, conveying a feeling of hopelessness, like a scene from Gorky\u2019s \u201cLower Depths.\u201d  Outside the Biennale, a majestic Philip Guston show at the Accademia connects his work to the poetry of T.S. Eliot, W.B. Yeats and others. An installation at the Cini Foundation offers a valuable insight into the techniques of Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol as they created their very first silkscreens. Mark Tobey\u2019s retrospective at the Guggenheim shows, among other works, his webs of white writing traceries."]

House Republicans on Monday released a detailed proposal that marks their first attempt in the new Congress to unite fractious GOP members behind a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and deliver on a central campaign promise by Republicans. The proposed legislation would dismantle much of the 2010 law known as Obamacare and create a new tax credit tied to an individual\u2019s age and income, aimed at helping Americans buy insurance if they don\u2019t get it at work."]
["Health Policy", "It is unclear how much the plan will cost or how many people could potentially lose health insurance under the changes as the proposal doesn\u2019t provide an estimate.  Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news. The proposed plan would end the requirement that most Americans have health coverage or pay a penalty, a provision long derided by Republicans, and a mandate that larger employers provide health insurance to workers. It also would repeal most of the health law\u2019s taxes starting in 2018 and freeze funding in 2020 for the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law. The bill is a political gamble for House Republican leaders. The party and President Donald Trump ran for office on promises to repeal and replace the health law. Republicans have said their plan is aimed at decreasing costs and boosting choice for consumers. But to do so, their proposals would likely provide coverage for far fewer people than the ACA, according to a number of research reports. \u201cWorking together, this unified Republican government will deliver relief and peace of mind to the millions of Americans suffering under Obamacare,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan. \u201cTrumpcare doesn\u2019t replace the Affordable Care Act, it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) Earlier versions included provisions opposed by both conservative and centrist Republicans, whose support for the now-altered bill will be crucial. House Republican leaders hope the package will be passed by Congress by mid-April."]
["Health Policy", "Mr. Trump praised the bill on Tuesday morning, writing on\n            Twitter\n,\n      \u201cOur wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster\u2014is imploding fast!\u201d In a statement Monday night, White House press secretary Sean Spicer called the bill \u201can important step toward restoring health care choices and affordability back to the American people.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump looks forward to working with both Chambers of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.  The legislation would provide tax credits to people who don\u2019t get coverage through their job, replacing the subsidies the ACA gave to a narrower set of lower-income people to help them afford insurance policies. The ACA subsidies are also tax credits\u2014advance credits paid to insurance companies to lower the cost of health-insurance premiums.  The proposal wouldn\u2019t kill the ACA\u2019s exchanges where people can obtain insurance, but far fewer people are expected to use them because the subsidies that reduce premium costs would no longer exist. Those subsidies are only available now to people who obtain coverage through the state and federal ACA exchanges. The refundable tax credits have been a thorny issue for Republicans. Conservative Republicans vowed not to support an earlier draft that would have provided the tax credits regardless of income."]
["Health Policy", "Under the House GOP proposal released Monday, the refundable tax credits would be tied to age, with people under 30 eligible for a credit of $2,000 a year, increasing steadily to $4,000 for those over 60. The size of a tax credit would grow with the size of a family, but would be capped at $14,000. To assuage the concern among conservative lawmakers that the credits would be available to wealthy Americans, the tax credits would start to shrink for individuals making more than $75,000 or households making more than $150,000. For every $1,000 in income over $75,000, the tax credit would be reduced by $100. In a sign GOP leaders\u2019 changes may have assuaged some conservative concerns, Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R., N.C.) said in a statement Monday night that the bill reflects \u201cthe right direction.\u201d Mr. Walker, who had opposed an earlier version of the bill, said his group of conservative lawmakers would meet Tuesday evening to review it closely. In a provision sure to draw resistance from moderate Republicans in the Senate, the House proposal would bar federal funding for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which provides reproductive-health services to women. The bill also maintains the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion temporarily. Sixteen Republican governors lead states that chose to expand Medicaid under funding provided by the health law, and they have been pressuring GOP leaders not to repeal the extended federal funding outright."]
["Health Policy", "The GOP plan aims to appease their concerns by leaving the expansion untouched through the end of 2019. After that, funding would begin to be reduced in an attempt to make up for the revenue lost by repealing the taxes contained in the existing health law. Beginning in January 2020, the federal government would transition into a system in which a set amount of funding would be sent to the states each year. The move is expected to save the federal government significant money over time but could result in fewer people having insurance coverage. Bruce Siegel, president and chief executive officer of America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, an association of public and nonprofit hospitals, urged Congress to wait for a Congressional Budget Office evaluation, or score, of the bill before taking action. \u201cWithout a CBO score, there are too many unknowns and too great a risk of coverage losses without affordable alternatives for many Americans,\u201d he said. Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia sent a letter Monday to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) expressing concerns over the House\u2019s approach to overhauling the Medicaid program in an earlier draft of the bill. \u201cWe believe Medicaid needs to be reformed, but reform should not come at the cost of disruption in access to health care for our country\u2019s most vulnerable and sickest individuals,\u201d the four lawmakers wrote."]
["Health Policy", "Ms. Capito said Monday night that the House\u2019s health-care plan was \u201cmoving in the right direction,\u201d but that she needed to look at it more closely before backing it. She said she worried that the tax credit might not be generous enough for low-income individuals. \u201cMy understanding is that it\u2019s on the low side.\u201d she said. House Republicans ducked one fight by deciding not to change the popular tax break on health plans that people get through their employer. Instead, they are planning to pay for the bill by allowing the ACA\u2019s taxes to remain in place until the start of 2018. They also would allow the tax on expensive employer health plans to kick in on Jan. 1, 2025, instead of being repealed. Congress already had voted to delay the tax until 2020. That could prove unpopular with conservative Republicans, who wanted to get rid of all of the 2010 health law\u2019s taxes immediately. The House GOP bill also would expand health savings accounts aimed at helping people save money for health costs.  The proposal would also end a special executive compensation limit that the 2010 law applied to health insurers. That law prevented companies from deducting more than $500,000 in pay to executives. Other companies face a $1 million limit, but that cap doesn\u2019t apply to performance-based compensation. The bill, which was largely completed over the weekend in closed-door meetings with the White House and GOP leadership, is expected to be voted on in House committees this week."]

En Marche had said Monday it would name all 577 candidates for the legislative elections on Thursday, a key step in Mr. Macron\u2019s attempt to strengthen political backing for his plans to overhaul the country.

["Europe News", "En Marche\u2014founded barely a year ago\u2014was submerged by a wave of over 19,000 applicants, including from political heavyweights Mr. Macron may have to rely on to build coalitions in parliament.  On Thursday, it was only ready to name 428. Beyond the difficulties of assessing so many applicants, En Marche also wants to leave the door open to figures from the center-right who have been reluctant to cross over to the party, secretary-general Richard Ferrand said. \u201cWe want to be able to welcome the broadest possible coming together,\u201d Mr. Ferrand said. The names of the remaining 149 candidates will be disclosed by May 17, after Mr. Macron takes office Sunday and appoints his government.

The 39-year-old emerged from behind the scenes to win the presidential election on a promise of transcending France\u2019s mainstream parties, whose bickering he says prevented the country from repairing its economy.  But the relative newcomer also needs the experience and networks of established politicians to ensure he can pass key economic measures, including labor-law overhauls, this summer.

["Europe News", "He said half of the party\u2019s legislative candidates would come from outside the political establishment and have never held elected office. Mr. Macron also ruled out making deals with political parties and said he would field candidates in every constituency. But politics forced En Marche to compromise this week, after former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared he would be a candidate for Mr. Macron\u2019s party. Mr. Valls, however, didn\u2019t qualify in the end as he has been a lawmaker too long to meet En Marche\u2019s criteria for political renewal.  To avoid a quarrel and humiliating Mr. Valls, Mr. Ferrand said En Marche wouldn\u2019t field a candidate in the former prime minister\u2019s constituency, meaning the party will at most field 576 candidates instead of 577. \u201cWe aren\u2019t slamming the door in the face of a former prime minister,\u201d Mr. Ferrand said.  Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party has named 428 candidates for the country\u2019s 577 legislative constituencies. Of those:  The En Marche selection procedure was anathema to many political veterans who cut their teeth in the backroom politics of France\u2019s parties and were waiting for the presidential election result before making a move. In a first step, all candidates had to fill out an online application and submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, cover letter and photocopy of their ID card. Those who made the cut then faced interviews over the telephone or in person. Afterward, a 12-strong nomination commission assessed whether a short-list of candidates measured up to Mr. Macron\u2019s program and demands."]

Mark Karpel\u00e8s, who was arrested in 2015 and released the following year pending trial, is charged with embezzlement and creation of unauthorized records at his company. Prosecutors at the Tokyo District Court said Tuesday that Mr. Karpel\u00e8s wrongfully spent \u00a5340 million ($3 million) of customers\u2019 money for his personal use. They also said he altered the company\u2019s books to inflate the amount of dollars and bitcoins held by customers."]
["Markets Main", "Mr. Karpel\u00e8s denied all wrongdoing at the hearing. \u201cI have never manipulated the exchange\u2019s data or used customer money for my own benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cI am innocent.\u201d  He repeated his contention that the exchange\u2019s collapse was caused by hackers, and he said he regretted that he was unable to prevent the losses suffered by customers. Mr. Karpel\u00e8s said he was willing to cooperate with a trustee handling Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy and authorities in trying to locate the lost bitcoins. The 32-year-old Frenchman, who currently works as an engineer in Japan, said the exchange had been profitable and the money he had spent on personal items came from his own funds, not customers\u2019 accounts. He said the accounting moves cited by prosecutors had been part of the exchange platform\u2019s normal operations. The amount at the center of the case represents a fraction of the money involved when Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014. At the time, Mr. Karpel\u00e8s said 750,000 bitcoins held by customers as well as 100,000 of Mt. Gox\u2019s own bitcoins had been stolen by hackers. Together, the lost virtual currency was then valued at some $500 million, although the exchange later said it had discovered 200,000 of the missing bitcoins. The court-appointed trustee in charge of the exchange\u2019s liquidation, Nobuaki Kobayashi,  has been investigating the whereabouts of the lost currency, but he has yet to release any conclusions. A representative of Mr. Kobayashi said he wasn\u2019t available to comment."]

Many have said they don\u2019t expect to get their money back and postings related to the exchange\u2019s collapse on online bitcoin forums have died down. \u201cI moved on,\u201d said Hiroki Minematsu,  an owner of technology companies in Nagasaki who deposited 70 bitcoins at Mt. Gox. \u201cIt would be nice if they find out what had exactly happened to serve my curiosity, but I threw away my hope for my investment a long time ago.\u201d Mt. Gox, one of the first bitcoin trading platforms, was among several virtual-currency exchanges that collapsed against a backdrop of security or governance problems.  When Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, the price of bitcoin, which was then slightly under $600, sustained a brief hit as investors questioned whether the virtual currency could survive. However, other exchanges have since sprung up and regulations have begun to define more clearly how bitcoin should be handled. Japanese rules that went into effect April 1 established bitcoin as a legitimate payment method and required exchanges to segregate customer accounts and monitor potential criminal activity. Growing interest from Japanese investors reassured by the new regulations\u2014as well as users in China who jumped on the currency as a way to transfer money\u2014has helped bitcoin surge to around $2,300. Japanese trials tend to proceed in fits and starts, and experts said it would likely take at least a year for the Tokyo District Court to reach a verdict on the charges against Mr. Karpel\u00e8s."]

Earlier this year,\n            Activision Blizzard\n Inc.\n      spent $5.9 billion to buy King. It credited the company with contributing about 23% of adjusted revenue in the first quarter.  Rather than hound people to repeatedly spend in small amounts, game makers sell caches of virtual currency, such as gems to be used inside games. The idea: Gamers will have an easier time parting with virtual coins than actual coins."]
["Technology", "Converting players into spenders without turning them off is key; gamers have derided free-to-play games as \u201cfree to play, pay to win\u201d for years. Developers, though, have gotten savvier about giving players more free things to do to keep them hooked until they start spending. In \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d players can go weeks capturing dozens of \u201cpocket monsters\u201d without needing to spend money. After investing so much time, players might be more inclined to dole out cash to upgrade their gear so they can carry more items and creatures, for example.  In\n            Electronic Arts\n Inc.\u2019s\n      \u201cStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes,\u201d players unlock characters by grinding their way through the role-playing combat game or using crystals available in increments ranging from $1.99 to $99.99. The game gives out crystals free, too, to keep people coming back. EA in May said it generated $173 million in revenue from mobile games in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 15% from a year earlier.

["China's World", "What's going on? A combination, it seems, of some questionable practices by multinationals, bullying by overenthusiastic regulators and a tense political atmosphere tinged with antiforeign sentiment. A pink Mercedes-Benz parked in Beijing. Daimler has slashed prices of spare parts in response to an antitrust probe.Agence France-Presse/Getty Images It's certainly true, as the Chinese media regularly point out, that the cost of everything from a\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks\n            \n      latte to a Jaguar sedan is higher in China than in many other places in the world. Now that so many Chinese are traveling abroad\u2014they took more than 100 million trips last year\u2014consumers are better able to compare prices. And they're starting to complain vociferously. Some of the price difference is explainable by factors such as transport and real-estate costs, higher Chinese import taxes and fragmented supply chains in which multiple dealers each add a markup. But at least some multinationals have adopted sales practices in China that might be ill tolerated by customers\u2014or regulators\u2014in Europe or the U.S. Auto makers, for instance, don't always give their Chinese customers a choice in their purchase of spare parts. High prices are the result. In response to an antitrust investigation, Mercedes maker\n            Daimler\n AG\n      and Chrysler have both slashed prices of their spare parts in recent weeks. "]
["China's World", " Microsoft, which has been the subject of surprise inspections related to how it distributes its products in China, has said it will cooperate with any inquiries. The fact that regulators are going after allegedly dubious practices by multinationals isn't what bothers trade officials at Western embassies in Beijing, even if they suspect that the probes sometimes have the effect of strengthening Chinese state-owned competitors. What concerns them the most is the heavy-handed way that investigations are being pursued\u2014and highly charged media coverage that makes for a troubling atmosphere for Western companies. Foreign executives have learned two early lessons from the antitrust probes. First, the law provides little refuge. The message that the National Development and Reform Commission, the government agency that sets pricing rules, delivers in private to multinationals at the outset of a price-fixing investigation is not to bring in their foreign lawyers, according to numerous accounts by foreign executives, diplomats and lawyers themselves. A couple visits an Audi show room in Beijing.AFP/Getty Images The second lesson is connected to the first: Resistance is futile. There's scant need for lawyers when companies face a choice of either bowing to demands for quick remedies or becoming involved in a protracted wrangle with regulators in what is still a state-dominated economy. In almost every antitrust case launched so far, foreign companies have capitulated without a fight. Voluntary price cuts of up to 20% are the norm, accompanied by board-level expressions of remorse and promises to do better."]
["China's World", "And these cuts are offered at the very outset of investigations\u2014and, sometimes, to get ahead of them. Chrysler described its abrupt decision to slash car-part prices as a \"proactive response\" to the price-fixing probe as it got under way. These price-fixing investigations have been accompanied by heated nationalistic rhetoric in the state media with antiforeign overtones. Taking down multinationals a peg plays well among the large sections of the public that view them as arrogant. The China Youth Daily castigated multinationals in a commentary, saying they \"pollute the environment, lie to consumers, act arrogantly when facing their wrongdoings, and ignore China's law and protests from Chinese consumers.\" Last year, when New Zealand dairy giant\n            Fonterra\n            \n      announced a possible botulism problem and recalled several products, Xinhua News Agency took aim not just at the company but the entire country of New Zealand. The \"100% Pure New Zealand\" tourism slogan had become a \"festering sore,\" Xinhua declared. It turned out to be a false alarm: Tests showed Fonterra products to be safe. This aggressive media coverage is in turn playing out against a backdrop of deepening political turmoil in China. President Xi Jinping's efforts to turn around the economy so it relies more on services and consumption, rather than investment, pits him against entrenched interests in state enterprises. Meanwhile, his all-out war on corruption is taking down some of the most powerful officials in the country and triggering anxiety across the bureaucracy."]
["China's World", "That combination\u2014populism along with high-level political uncertainty\u2014is unnerving many foreign investors. They fear they're being caught in the middle of powerful forces outside their control. Chinese regulators reject criticism that they unfairly target foreign players. \"Before the Antimonopoly Law, all enterprises are equal,\" the China Daily quoted Shen Danyang,  the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, as saying. \"There is no such thing as xenophobia.\" Still, it's a rude surprise for multinationals. Just as the China market opens up, their profit margins are headed down.

["Property Report", "But the financing machine for such rehabilitation projects is now in jeopardy, a potential casualty of the push to overhaul the U.S. tax code. Backers of the Newark program, which wouldn\u2019t be affected by the tax overhaul, argue that preserving existing affordable housing is as important as creating new units. That is often missed in the current debate over affordable housing, which has been heating up nationwide as supply drops to historic lows, industry executives say. Over the decades, tens of thousands of affordable units have been lost to neglect, disrepair and, most recently, changing markets. \u201cA lot of affordable housing is in areas that are beginning to gentrify,\u201d said Richard Rohrman,  chief executive of New Community Corp. The nonprofit organization manages the Newark units, located in four properties and more than 30 buildings, some of which are restricted to senior citizens. \u201cThe importance of what we\u2019re doing is to give these units another 25 years of life as affordable housing.\u201d The House version of the bill to overhaul the tax system, passed earlier this month, would kill the tax exemption on \u201cprivate activity\u201d bonds, which are used by affordable-housing developers, as well as hospitals, nursing homes and charter schools, to finance facility projects. If the tax bill becomes law, affordable-housing production would be reduced by about 700,000 units during the next decade, according to an analysis by Novogradac & Co., an accounting firm that specializes in real estate."]
["Property Report", "\u201cI don\u2019t think the intention [of the House] was to go after low income housing,\u201d Mr. Rohrman said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unintended consequence.\u201d Apart from construction, the changes also could cripple the business of rehabilitating existing affordable-housing units. No one tracks the amount spent on upgrades per year, but 57% of private-activity bond proceeds were used for acquisition and rehab of affordable rental housing in 2015, according Novogradac. \u201cOur anecdotal experience suggests this trend is continuing, if not increasing the use of [private-activity bonds] for rehabilitation of rental housing,\u201d said Michael Novogradac,  managing partner at the firm. Republican proponents of the House tax bill say numerous tax exemptions need to be eliminated to finance cuts in personal and corporate rates that would be included. Eliminating the exemption on private-activity bonds would generate $38.9 billion of additional tax revenue over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which prepares official estimates for Congress. Private-activity bonds would be retained by the version of the bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee. Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration hope to have a final bill by the end of the year. Maintenance and upgrades are crucial to preserve affordable housing, especially decades-old projects. The Newark program is described as \u201crapid rehabilitation\u201d because it is set up so residents aren\u2019t displaced.

["Property Report", "The Newark properties were mostly developed in the 1970s and 1980s, according to Chris Eisenzimmer, director of Greystone Affordable Development, the Greystone unit orchestrating the recent deal. Back then low-income housing often was financed by limited partners who purchased them primarily for the tax losses, he said. New Community, which was created after the 1968 riots in Newark, has owned a small piece of the equity and managed them. Rent has been subsidized through the Section 8 program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit program became the primary source of equity financing for affordable housing in 1986, when President Ronald Reagan pushed through the last major tax-code overhaul. Part of the tax-credit program would be preserved under the House bill but the part tied to private-activity bonds would effectively end. As part of the Newark deal, the original limited partners are selling the projects for $75.9 million to tax-credit investors. But the sellers, who achieved their investment goals through tax losses, aren\u2019t pocketing much of the proceeds, Mr. Eisenzimmer said. Rather, a portion of the proceeds are going to pay off existing debt on the properties. Also, the original limited partners are reinvesting much of it back in the properties in the form of a subordinate loan, Mr. Eisenzimmer said. \u201cA lot of these transactions may not pencil out unless you scale back construction or if you have sellers like these who are willing to work with you,\u201d he said."]

Gates and Manafort in Washington in October of laundering millions of dollars in income generated by their consulting work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine from 2008 through 2016, and failing to file reports on the lobbying work and on foreign bank accounts they controlled. Mr. Gates was an adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Mr. Manafort served briefly as the campaign\u2019s chairman before stepping down in August 2016. In the Washington case, Mr. Manafort is charged with conspiring to defraud the Treasury Department, conspiring to launder money and failing to file reports of his foreign lobbying efforts. He pleaded not guilty to those charges. Another set of charges\u2014including tax fraud and failure to file reports on foreign bank accounts, which prosecutors allege Mr. Manafort committed between 2010 and 2014\u2014were filed in Virginia, where Mr. Manafort lives.

Andrew Weissmann, a senior prosecutor from the office, said he expected the Virginia trial to take between eight and 10 days, with 20 to 25 witnesses. Under sentencing guidelines, prosecutors said Mr. Manafort faces between 8 and 10 years in prison if convicted of the tax fraud charges in Virginia. He would face an additional 12 to 15 to years for a conviction on the charges in the Washington case, prosecutors said. "]

["European Business News", "The Austrian government filed a criminal complaint in February against Airbus, seeking over $1 billion in restitution for what it claimed was wrongdoing by Airbus in winning an order for Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets signed in 2003. At the time, Mr. Enders ran the defense business of Airbus, then called European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.  Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets are built by Airbus, in conjunction with\n            BAE Systems\n            \n      PLC and\n            Leonardo\n            \n      SpA.

The Austrian government said in 2017 it was overcharged for the jets, which it said cost up to \u20ac1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) in total to buy and \u20ac183.4 million to operate to date. It first planned to buy 18 of the planes, but reduced the figure to 15 in 2007.  Suspicions of corruption were raised as early as 2002, before the contract was completed, but remained unsubstantiated until 2006, when a parliamentary committee in Vienna identified suspect payments apparently related to the sale. At the time, it had little evidence of the rationale behind the payments and investigations continued. Prosecutors are now under time pressure to act as they approach a 10-year statute of limitation. "]
["European Business News", "The probe is one of several corruption investigations Airbus is battling. The British Serious Fraud Office has been examining alleged bribery by an Airbus subsidiary in business dealings in Saudi Arabia for several years. In 2016, it also began investigating Airbus\u2019s possible misuse of middlemen in winning plane deals. Airbus said in April that the SFO investigation into aircraft financing could lead to penalties with a \u201cmaterial impact.\u201d\u00a0 The company is also facing legal challenges from intermediaries whose contracts it has canceled.

Nest was a pioneer in internet-connected home devices such as thermostats and home security cameras. But Amazon.com Inc. recently launched a home-security device that competes with Nest. Making Nest and its 1,000 employees part of Google would mark a retrenchment of Alphabet\u2019s strategy to separate its core Google internet business from a number of other units, such as its research lab and life-sciences firm. When Alphabet was formed in August 2015, Nest was the model \u201cother bet,\u201d with its own headquarters, hiring process and perks\u2014even its own branded bikes for employees."]

The Google Home smart speaker trails Amazon\u2019s Echo system. Nest\u2019s internet-connected thermostats, smoke detectors and security cameras work with both Google\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s virtual assistants.  Google bought Nest for $3.2 billion in 2014, an acquisition second in size only to its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola in 2012. Nest had become a hot startup in the nascent Internet of Things market by building slick, internet-connected versions of overlooked home devices like thermostats. \n\u2018The only surprising thing to me is that it\u2019s taken this long.\u2019\n"]
["Technology", "But the company has since been slow to release new products and last year lost its high-profile co-founder and CEO, Tony Fadell, a former Apple Inc. executive. Nest for years tried to develop a platform for internet-connected devices, but recently has been upstaged by talking speakers with embedded virtual assistants\u2014mainly the Amazon Echo and Google Home\u2014which have become the hubs for connected homes. Alphabet last year moved several dozen Nest engineers working on Weave over to Google, though many have since returned, a person familiar with the matter said. It also combined the two companies\u2019 supply-chain teams last year, moving about 100 Nest employees to Google. Former Nest employees said they also collaborated more closely with their Google counterparts over the past year. Still, Nest has remained independent, with its own legal, marketing and public-relations teams. Nest ads typically don\u2019t mention its Google connection. Nest even still uses Amazon\u2019s cloud services, though it is shifting to Google\u2019s. The new Nest Cam can be your eyes and ears when you aren\u2019t home. Is it better than the rest?

Yet even now that Britain\u2019s lack of leverage has been laid bare, an air of unreality remains about much of the Brexit debate."]
["Europe File", "One fantasy that refuses to die is the notion that the EU might somehow be persuaded to water down the principle of free movement of citizens, thus allowing the U.K. to restrict EU migration while retaining its membership in the single market. This idea first surfaced during David Cameron\u2019s doomed attempt to rewrite the free-movement rules before the Brexit referendum. It reappeared this week in a new campaign by more than 50 Labour politicians who want the U.K. to remain inside a \u201creformed single market.\u201d Yet it should be obvious by now that there is no appetite in the EU to water down the right of free movement, a point even Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded.  There is certainly anxiety over immigration in many EU countries, but it relates largely to migration from outside the bloc. It is also true that some countries would like to reform the rules around access to welfare. But no other country shares Britain\u2019s neuralgia about the principle of the free movement of people, which is broadly accepted as the price to be paid for the free movement of jobs.  When the single market in financial services was created in the 1990s, tens of thousands of jobs migrated to London from Paris, Milan and Frankfurt, in turn creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in other sectors. Britain today is host to millions of European jobs in all industries and all parts of the country. Why would any EU government agree to a deal that allowed the U.K. to retain European jobs while restricting them to British workers?"]
["Europe File", "A second fantasy is that the U.K. might engineer a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit by joining the European Economic Area alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This has the superficial appeal of keeping the U.K. in the single market, but it could never work as a long-term solution. Not only would it require the U.K. to accept the free movement of people, but would also oblige the country to become a rule-taker rather than rule-maker.  David Davis, the U.K. minister charged with overseeing the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, listening during a news conference marking the start of Brexit negotiations in Brussels on Monday. Photo: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg News That is bound to be unacceptable. Only this week, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond accused some in the EU of advancing \u201cprotectionist agendas\u2026disguised as arguments about regulatory competence, financial stability and supervisory oversight.\u201d The idea that the U.K. could sit on the sidelines, as Norway must, when the EU next draws up banking rules is absurd. But could the EEA be a short-term solution to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit challenges, operating as a transitional arrangement while the long-term relationship is negotiated? This seems far-fetched too. The EEA doesn\u2019t pertain to the EU customs union, all EU free-trade agreements and agriculture, so it could only be a partial solution and would mean striking many other deals. A push to join the EEA would in any case be complex to negotiate, requiring not only the consent of 27 EU members but also the three other countries in the EEA. And the EU has been clear that any transitional deal must come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice\u2014precluding one under the European Free Trade Agreement court that oversees the EEA. "]
["Europe File", "The truth is there is no soft option for the U.K.: The price of a transitional deal is almost certain to be continued adherence to all EU obligations overseen by the ECJ. The third fantasy is that the U.K. can negotiate a full new trade deal with the EU by the end of the Article 50 exit talks in March 2019. EU officials are adamant that it isn\u2019t practically possible to negotiate a divorce deal and a new trade deal in 20 months. Even if the U.K. capitulated to all the EU\u2019s demands, it would likely take a year to complete the detailed technical work on the withdrawal agreement and transitional arrangements, which would then need to be ratified, EU officials say. Nor is it legally possible either: The EU isn\u2019t authorized to negotiate a free-trade agreement with an existing member, and the EU\u2019s negotiating team would need a detailed negotiating mandate from member states before trade talks could start. This point was made repeatedly to Mrs. May by Sir Ivan Rogers,  the former U.K. ambassador to the EU, who was frozen out by Downing Street for his efforts. Yet it suits the British government to keep insisting that both the divorce deal and a new trade deal can be reached in two years. One reason is that it allows Mr. Davis to present his capitulation over sequencing as a mere tactical retreat, on the basis that \u201cnothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\u201d "]
["Europe File", "More importantly, it delays the moment when politicians must face up to the real choice: whether to make the ultimate capitulation\u2014pay the Brexit divorce bill in return for a transition deal with no guarantees on future trade\u2014or take the British economy over the cliff.

Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing customers in the market include Standard Bank of South Africa and the South African State Information Technology Agency, she said. Research firm International Data Corp. estimates that total cloud revenue in South Africa last year was just $243 million, but expects it to grow nearly 20% a year through 2021. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have been racing to open data centers around the globe. They have been willing to shoulder the costs for such centers, which can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, to keep pace with one another and create a barrier for would-be rivals to catch up. After the openings, Microsoft will have 40 major data centers globally. Combined, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet spent a combined $31.54 billion in 2016 in capital expenditures and capital leases, up 22% from 2015, according to company filings. Not every dollar of that is spent on data centers that deliver infrastructure as a service, but each company describes the cloud as a major investment area. The new data centers should help Microsoft win over South African business customers who\u2019ve wanted to move their computing operations to the cloud, but have been unwilling to have that service provided by data centers in Europe, said IDC analyst Jon Tullett.

["Europe News", "Mr. Rutte, a young-looking 50-year-old, made his mark as a fiscal conservative with liberal social policies. He has spent most of his time as prime minister since 2010 dealing with the fallout from Europe\u2019s financial crisis. During those years, parts of Dutch society have turned more critical of European integration and of Muslim minorities who are viewed as reluctant to accept the Netherlands\u2019 secular, liberal values. Opinion polls point to a highly fragmented parliament. With most Dutch voters still in the middle ground, centrist parties are poised to make gains, although Mr. Rutte is the favorite to lead a multiparty coalition even if his Liberals come second to Mr. Wilders\u2019s group, as no party is willing to join with the far-right politician. Mr. Rutte launched his election campaign with a full-page letter to the nation published in several newspapers, in which he complained of antisocial behavior by people who don\u2019t accept Dutch norms. He attacked those who, he said, come to the Netherlands because of its freedoms, but then refuse to shake women\u2019s hands, harass gay people and accuse the Dutch of being racists. \u201cBehave normally or leave,\u201d he wrote.

["The Outlook", "Whether officials can pull off a repeat performance by sticking to their road map of gradual rate increases again next year is clouded by conflicting signals on two items that matter most to the central bank: employment and inflation. Steady job gains have dropped the unemployment rate to lower-than-expected levels, at 4.1% in October, a 17-year low. If the unemployment rate drops next year as much as it did this year\u2014a 0.7 percentage point slide\u2014it would plumb lows not seen since the late 1960s. Yet inflation has been puzzlingly soft. After nosing above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for the first time in five years at the start of 2017, it slowed unexpectedly and hasn\u2019t yet rebounded. Excluding volatile food and energy categories, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge rose just 1.3% from a year earlier in September. At first, officials believed a few idiosyncratic price declines, such as wireless phone plans and prescription drugs, were to blame, though the weakness has proved more widespread and stubborn. Many economists, including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen,  have long trusted in the framework advanced by the economist A.W. Phillips, who in 1958 hypothesized employers would bid up wages when workers grew scarce and hold wages steady when workers were abundant. Today, wages and prices haven\u2019t moved as the framework would suggest, raising questions over whether the labor market might have more slack or if something more permanent is holding inflation back."]
["The Outlook", "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing quite what we\u2019re expecting to see,\u201d said New York Fed President William Dudley this month. \u201cThat creates a bit of uncertainty about the best course going forward.\u201d Most Fed officials expect once the jobless rate falls low enough, price pressures will re-emerge. No one is quite sure what that exact level is, but each decline in the unemployment rate brings the economy a little closer to it. Mr. Dudley said low inflation isn\u2019t all bad because it means the economy might be able to sustain a lower jobless rate. The Fed has held its benchmark federal-funds rate in a range between 1% and 1.25% since lifting it in June.  The economy is still adding more than enough jobs to keep up with the growth of the working-age population, and the unemployment rate is now below levels officials view as sustainable, around 4.6%. Last December, Fed officials projected the unemployment rate would end this year within a range of 4.4% to 4.7%. In September, the projection had edged down to a range of 4.2% to 4.5%. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the unemployment rate to keep falling, to 3.7% by the end of 2018 and 3.5% by the end of 2019. For the Fed, the ideal scenario would look something like this: job growth slows a little in order to hold the unemployment rate steady, at around 4%, with inflation slowly returning to its 2% target. Tight labor markets would continue to boost wages while encouraging employers to pull workers out of the shadows of the labor market and to provide more nonwage benefits, such as worker training."]
["The Outlook", "Three risks loom. The first is the unemployment rate drops too low, too quickly, leading to an unsustainable rise in prices that forces the Fed to raise rates at a fast clip, triggering a recession. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a boom-bust policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in New York last week. The second risk is inflation doesn\u2019t respond as expected but the Fed keeps raising rates because unemployment falls lower. This could push inflation even lower still and hold back the economy. Persistently low inflation in the end would force the Fed to cease any rate increase campaign and could leave it with little room to maneuver should another recession hit. \u201cIt can be quite dangerous to allow inflation to drift down and not to achieve over time a central bank\u2019s inflation target,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. The third risk is the economy avoids an inflation run-up but rising asset values and low market volatility fuel financial imbalances. The last two expansions ended this way, with the tech-stock bubble of 2000 and the housing-market collapse of 2007. Stock valuations have advanced to their highest levels since the 2000 crash and adjusted for inflation, home prices in August stood just 13% below their peak from the past decade. Officials aren\u2019t overly troubled yet, but that could change if stock and home prices keep rising fast. Ms. Yellen\u2019s nominated successor, Fed governor Jerome Powell,  might try to use regulatory tools to fight an asset price boom. But such tools have had mixed results in other countries, and Republicans want Mr. Powell to lighten the regulatory load. He might instead be pressed toward fighting an asset price boom with higher interest rates."]
["The Outlook", "For now officials see gradual rate increases as the best way to hedge against all these risks. In September, Fed officials had penciled in three more rate increases for 2018, and they will provide updated projections at the December meeting. But economists at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. expect the Fed to raise rates four times next year because they forecast tighter labor markets and a rebound in inflation. Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation hearing on Tuesday before a Senate panel could offer early insight into how he will approach the coming year of difficult trade-offs and even harder choices.

Output this year is expected to surpass a record from 1970 and is outpacing production rates from a few years ago when oil was $100. So far demand has been able to keep up with oil\u2019s slow and steady rise and has helped fuel the higher prices. With economies around the world firing on all cylinders, global growth has underpinned oil\u2019s rise and soaked up the extra output coming from the U.S. \u201cOil is rising, but it\u2019s not rising at a pace which creates significant shocks for the real economy,\u201d said Alan Ruskin,  head of G-10 foreign exchange strategy and a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe global economy is strong.

Spotify\u2019s consumer platform gives it an edge in some areas. \u201cThey can tell a band whether it should plan a tour to Baltimore based on how its fan base is developing there,\u201d says P\u00e4r-J\u00f6rgen P\u00e4rson, a Spotify investor at venture-capital firm Northzone. But it is a leap to suggest the company can displace the big distributors. More likely it will force them to improve their service."]
["Heard on the Street", "The root of the problem is that Spotify can\u2019t afford to antagonize the big three. The breadth of its catalog is a key part of the streaming giant\u2019s customer proposition. That gives Universal Music, for example, with its roughly 35% market share of distribution rights, a veto over anything Spotify does. Mr. Ek needs to excite investors by promising disruption while keeping the big record labels on board by promising growth. Juggling these messages will become harder once the company goes public. Spotify\u2019s path to tech stardom involves developing a new business model in conflict with its old one. This may make for better entertainment than investment.

Mr. Williams would need approval by the Fed\u2019s Washington-based board of governors; a final decision could be announced next month."]
["Central Banks", "Mr. Williams, who has done leading economic research that has shaped top Fed officials\u2019 thinking on monetary policy, would fill a second leg of a leadership troika now being formed, alongside new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the vice chair of the board, a post currently vacant. The Wall Street Journal has reported that President Donald Trump is likely to nominate Columbia University economist Richard Clarida for Fed vice chairman, a job for which Mr. Williams interviewed.  Mr. Williams\u2019s background would be unusual for a New York Fed president, who traditionally has had more experience in markets or international affairs. The role involves helping to craft monetary policy and implement it through the financial markets, while serving as the Fed\u2019s main contact with Wall Street.  But Mr. Williams, a 55-year-old who holds a Ph.D. in economics from Stanford University, could complement Mr. Powell, whose background is in finance and is the first noneconomist in more than 30 years to lead the Fed. Mr. Powell has been especially keen on having someone in the job with extensive monetary-policy experience, people familiar with the matter said. The desire to give the new chairman a lieutenant with a strong background in monetary policy was shared by the selection committee in New York, these people said."]
["Central Banks", "These people said that emphasis, together with uncertainty over who would be picked as Mr. Powell\u2019s No. 2 in Washington, which the White House hasn\u2019t moved to fill, helped to boost Mr. Williams\u2019s candidacy over other finalists: Raymond McGuire,  a longtime official at\n            Citigroup\n Inc.,\n      and Mary Miller, a bond-market veteran who served in top Treasury Department posts earlier this decade. \u201cJohn Williams would be a very good choice,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. \u201cHe understands the financial system, he is an outstanding researcher, and he is pragmatic and not bound by a particular dovish or hawkish view\u2014all characteristics that are very important in a Powell-led Fed.\u201d Prioritizing monetary-policy expertise over financial markets \u201cwould reflect an assessment that New York Fed president is first and foremost a policy job and that the new president will be able to rely on the institutional strength of the New York Fed to support effective market outreach and analysis,\u201d said Krishna Guha,  vice chairman of research firm Evercore ISI and a former communications executive at the New York Fed. As New York Fed chief, Mr. Williams also would play a critical role in making technical determinations to manage the paring down of the Fed\u2019s $4.4 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Some would prefer a candidate with more markets experience than Mr. Williams has."]
["Central Banks", "\u201cHaving someone really immersed in market functioning is going to be really important in all of that,\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist who is on an advisory panel at the New York Fed. The selection would disappoint lawmakers and outside groups that have pressed the Fed to diversify its predominantly white, male leadership. Mr. Williams has been a reliable ally of Fed leadership since becoming the San Francisco Fed\u2019s president in 2011, and voted with other central-bank officials to raise interest rates last week. He and other officials signaled that a burst of stimulus from recent government-spending increases and tax cuts could require them to raise rates gradually in the coming years to keep the expansion on an even keel.  As New York Fed president, Mr. Williams would play a formative role shaping how the Fed would judge the balance of risks between keeping rates too low\u2014which could allow the economy to overheat\u2014and raising rates too quickly, which could prevent inflation from rising to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Central bankers believe 2% inflation is good for the economy because it reflects healthy demand and enables businesses to raise prices and wages. While the unemployment rate, at 4.1%, is at a 17-year low, annual inflation remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% goal. Mr. Williams has noted the risks of holding rates too low for too long, and he has said repeatedly he believes the economy is at full employment, meaning inflation might accelerate if joblessness drops lower."]
["Central Banks", "Mr. Williams has worked in the Fed system since 1994, first as an economist in Washington and after 2002 in San Francisco, where he rose to become the bank\u2019s research director under then-President Janet Yellen,  who just completed a term as Fed chairwoman. His influential research at the Fed includes his work with Thomas Laubach, a top Fed economist, on identifying the neutral rate of interest: the inflation-adjusted rate that neither spurs nor curbs growth. Understanding how to glean this unobservable rate is critical to setting Fed interest-rate policy. Mr. Williams has argued, and many other officials have come to agree, that the neutral rate fell very low during the financial crisis and recession and hasn\u2019t recovered much since. This conclusion became a key factor behind the Fed\u2019s thinking in keeping its own benchmark federal-funds rate very low in recent years and then raising it slowly and cautiously. More recently, Mr. Williams has been outspoken in calling on Fed officials to rethink their 2% inflation target, and allow periods where inflation might run higher to make up for times where it runs lower. More economists say the current target might not work as well in an environment where interest rates are likely to remain lower for longer.  As a Fed researcher in the 1990s, Mr. Williams collaborated with David Reifschneider, another senior Fed economist, to evaluate how interest-rate policy should be managed in an environment of low inflation. The research examined Japan\u2019s experience at the time with deflation, with wages and prices chasing each other down. It proved prescient after the 2008 financial crisis when U.S. policy makers had to rewrite their own playbook on how to stimulate growth after slashing interest rates to near zero."]
["Central Banks", "Permanently lower rates would give the Fed less room to cut rates to combat a downturn. \u201cI think we need to think seriously about how we would do one or a combination of these to prepare ourselves better for that next storm,\u201d Mr. Williams said in November. The members of the Fed board of governors are nominated by the U.S. president and subject to Senate confirmation. The 12 Fed reserve bank presidents aren\u2019t. Instead, the members of each reserve bank\u2019s board of directors who don\u2019t represent private banks regulated by the Fed select the leader of the bank, subject to approval by the Fed\u2019s board in Washington.

But some objectives, such as repealing the alternative minimum tax, fell by the wayside in last-minute wrangling."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cIn the end it all came together and we\u2019re pretty excited about what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish for the American people,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said in an interview Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a corporate rate at 20% that we think makes us competitive in the world again and provided substantial middle-income tax relief.\u201d The bill passed 51-49, with all but one Republican voting for it and all Democrats voting against. The sole Republican, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, stated his opposition before the vote, citing worries it would expand budget deficits. The bill\u2019s ultimate passage would mark a legislative victory for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. Mr. Trump has made the tax overhaul a centerpiece of his economic policy goals, focusing on a rewrite of business taxes, which he has argued make the U.S. uncompetitive internationally. The bill could also give lawmakers something to campaign on in the 2018 midterm elections.  Democrats blasted the bill, calling it an unacceptable giveaway to corporations and the wealthy. They also criticized last-minute Republican adjustments and waved handwritten amendments around the Senate floor to show how hastily the changes were being made.  \u201cA flurry of last-minute changes will stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on millions in the middle class,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader, said. "]
["Politics and Policy", "The House and Senate still need to reconcile competing versions of the tax plan, something GOP leaders hope to do by Christmas. The House and Senate bills overlap in many ways, and lawmakers expressed optimism about getting a final deal done. \u201cThe bills are not all that different,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cWe tried to move ours somewhat in the House direction.\u201d Senate Republicans called their bill an economic booster shot, their best chance to create faster sustained growth and higher wages. But it comes with risks. Congress\u2019s own nonpartisan analysis found that the economic benefits would be modest and fade over time. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the tax cuts wouldn\u2019t pay for themselves, as Republicans promised. Instead the analysis found they would increase deficits by $1 trillion over a decade, even after accounting for economic growth.  Investors, for now, are more excited about the prospect of lower corporate taxes than about the risks associated with larger government deficits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 673.60 points for the week, or 2.9%, to 24231.59. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which might be expected to rise if bond investors were worried about deficits, remain comfortably low, below 2.5%. Senators began voting on amendments late Friday night and that continued into early Saturday. They defeated, 29-71, an attempt by Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Mike Lee (R., Utah) to expand the child tax credit for low-income families, which would have been paid for by setting the corporate tax rate at 20.94%."]

Ted Cruz (R., Texas) to allow the use of 529 savings accounts to pay for elementary and secondary school costs, including private-school tuition.  Saturday\u2019s vote came after a week of long hours and frantic rewriting and deal-making. The GOP tax effort wobbled late Thursday after the Joint Committee on Taxation analysis raised the concerns of budget hawks about deficits. An attempt to add deficit countermeasures in the bill failed to clear parliamentary rules. Mr. McConnell and his team salvaged the measure with a series of last-minute deals to sway wavering senators. Sens. Steve Daines (R., Mont.) and Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) won bigger tax breaks for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations. Sen.

["Politics and Policy", "To help pay for some of those changes, Republicans increased a new tax on companies\u2019 stockpiled foreign profits to 14.5% for cash and 7.5% for illiquid assets, from 10% and 5% in a previous version.  Senate Republicans abandoned other goals. They preserved the alternative minimum tax instead of repealing it. They backed off a plan to abolish the estate tax. They retained seven tax brackets instead of collapsing them into three as planned. And after years of warning about the rising national debt and promising a tax overhaul that would be revenue-neutral, they chose to proceed despite warnings the measure would add to deficits in the long run. Lawmakers released the final changes\u2014moving around hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014a few hours before the last vote, and there was no updated analysis of the bill\u2019s impact on taxpayers and the economy as Republicans moved toward voting on it. \u201cThe Republicans have managed to take a bad bill and make it worse. It was chock-full of special-interest giveaways before tonight,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.  The bill would overhaul much of the U.S. tax system in ways that tax experts are only beginning to understand. Mr. Trump and some Republicans set the 20% corporate tax rate as an immovable objective and despite some occasional doubts, the GOP stuck with it. That is a win for domestic retailers and manufacturers who have spent years building the political case for a lower tax rate."]
["Politics and Policy", "Pass-through firms, which pay their business taxes through individual returns rather than corporate returns, won major concessions. They would get a 23% deduction from individual rates. More than half of U.S. business income goes to pass-throughs, and more than half of that goes to the top 1% of households. Tax analysts said this deduction opens new and unprecedented avenues for tax avoidance, with individuals likely seeking to declare as much of their income as possible as lower-taxed business profits. Even in a bill that provides sizable tax cuts to many, some taxpayers are set to lose. The bill would prevent individuals from deducting state and local income taxes. That is likely to raise federal taxes on upper-middle-class wage earners in high-tax states, such as California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. They are all represented by Democrats in the Senate. The standard deduction would be nearly doubled and the child tax credit would rise, while personal exemptions would be repealed. For many households, that combination would modestly increase the amount of earnings that aren\u2019t subject to income tax. The bill also would push millions of households out of itemizing deductions. That would reduce the incentive to deduct mortgage interest and charitable contributions. But nonprofits, home builders and real-estate agents were unable to sway Republicans to reverse course on the measure. Debt-reliant businesses would lose, too, under a provision that limits interest deductions to 30% of income. Republicans said those changes were necessary to lower the rate and make other changes that would encourage investment in the U.S."]

But the suit does allege that a \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d received hundreds of millions of dollars in siphoned funds. The Wall Street Journal has reported that official is Mr. Najib, citing a person with direct knowledge of the investigation.  The White House declined interview requests last week on the visit, which is expected to include a photo session of the two leaders. People familiar with the case also said the meeting could complicate any future criminal case stemming from the allegations, if defendants in subsequent cases could use any photos of Mr. Najib meeting with Mr. Trump or other senior White House officials in their defense. Last month, the White House said Mr. Trump was looking forward to discussing with Mr. Najib ways to strengthen ties, calling Malaysia \u201cone of America\u2019s closest partners in Southeast Asia.\u201d"]
["U.S. News", "A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, but people familiar with the case said the Department wasn\u2019t involved with planning Mr. Najib\u2019s visit and stressed that the Malaysian leader hadn\u2019t been charged.  People familiar with the situation said the White House and State Department are responsible for U.S. diplomacy, but that it was unusual that Mr. Trump would be meeting with Mr. Najib, given the corruption case. Other U.S. officials said the visit should be worthwhile if only because it will offer a chance to discuss North Korea with Malaysian officials, and press them to do more to crack down on Pyongyang. Mr. Najib will be the second Southeast Asian leader to visit Mr. Trump in Washington, following a trip in May by Vietnam\u2019s prime minister. Mr. Najib also met with former President Barack Obama\u2014on a 2014 trip by Mr. Obama to Malaysia, for golf that year in Hawaii, and at a 2015 summit\u2014but he never visited Mr. Obama at the White House. Mr. Najib\u2019s White House visit is the first by a Malaysian leader since 2004. With a fast-growing economy and straddling oceangoing trade routes to much of Asia, Malaysia could be a crucial partner to any effort to isolate North Korea.

["U.S. News", "But for years it has been a conduit for Pyongyang to do business in ways that United Nations investigators say have helped the regime evade global sanctions. A loose regulatory environment makes Malaysia an easy base for illicit transshipment, financing and foreign exchange transactions, experts on North Korea have said. Malaysia was named in a report published late last week by U.N. experts investigating the evasion of international sanctions against the purchase of North Korean coal, after China agreed to prohibit imports earlier this year.  Malaysia rebuffed U.N. queries about coal shipments and about North Korean officials operating in Malaysia, as well as a request to shut down firms seen as helping the nuclear-armed regime evade sanctions, according to the report. The U.N. report alleges that a Malaysian group is still buying coal from North Korea, and that another set of Malaysian firms is part of a network North Korea uses to procure components for its banned exports of military equipment. Those companies work on behalf of another Malaysia-based firm called Global Communications Co., which U.N. investigators say is a front company for Pyongyang\u2019s premier intelligence service, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The firm, contacted through an email address on the company\u2019s website, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the allegations.

Answer: watching the above, while the bureaucracy back home quietly churns out new price controls. China has developed a new color coding system for coal prices, with increasing levels of intervention to control prices as they move outside a \u201cgreen\u201d zone of $70 to $80 a ton. The move follows intense volatility in global coal prices, which gained over 70% in 2016 after sharp Chinese capacity cuts collided with rebounding industrial electricity demand.

["Heard on the Street", " Coal price controls in China have a long and unhappy history, and there is little doubt that prices are far freer than at the turn of the century. But further progress under the current administration has been scattershot. Under Xi Jinping,  markets have been allowed to play a greater role in the economy\u2014as long as they move in a direction policy makers like. When they don\u2019t, however, rhetorical homage to free markets quickly goes out the window. That helps smooth short term volatility. But the costs are substantial. The government is willing to bear those costs because coal is China\u2019s main energy source and rising prices have political and social implications. For China, it means slower growth and a higher risk of a big financial blowup in the long run as, in the absence of proper market signals, capital allocation runs amok in the state-owned sector. And for foreign investors eyeing Chinese firms, it often means poor returns, as state-owned firms are forced into national service or miss opportunities to profit off rising prices due to administrative diktats. The recent struggle to control coal prices is a classic example of the latter. Chinese coal production has finally rebounded in response to rising prices, but big state-owned miners, which are easier to police, have largely missed the bonanza. Output from key state-owned mines in November was still down 8% on the year following forced capacity cuts in early 2016. But production for the country as a whole was only down 4%, suggesting that more flexible small and midsize mines have actually reaped much of the benefits of rising prices."]
["Heard on the Street", "One result: lagging share prices for listed Chinese miners. Hong Kong-listed\n            China Coal Energy\n\u2019s\n      sales were still down almost 6% on the year in the third quarter, even though coal prices were up 35% over the same period.\n            China Shenhua\n            \n      and\n            China Coal Energy\n            \n      shares are up 33% and 39% since end-December 2015 respectively, against gains of more than 100% for\n            Glencore\n,\nYancoal Australia\n            \n      and Rio Tinto.  On scale and market size alone, China and its key state-owned enterprises should be leaders of the next phase of globalization. But unless the nation is prepared to put more faith in markets back home, it is hard to see other nations following its lead. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership"]

Mr. Trump\u2019s push led to a tense national security meeting last week in which the president pressed the military to wrap up the fight against Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in six months, according to U.S. officials. Top Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s public pledge to withdraw from Syria had sent the wrong signal that Mr. Assad could use chemical weapons without fear of an American military response. In light of Saturday\u2019s attack, they and other lawmakers said, Mr. Trump should reconsider his push to quickly get U.S. forces out of Syria."]
["World News", "On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed the senators\u2019 comments as \u201coutrageous\u201d and said the U.S. could pull its troops out of Syria and still use its military might to discourage Mr. Assad from carrying out chemical attacks. \u201cThe president wants to bring our troops home after we complete the mission to eradicate ISIS in Syria.,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time he wants to make sure Assad is deterred from using chemical weapons attacks on innocent civilians.\u201d  Her comments appeared to suggest that the U.S. and its allies might launch strikes meant to cripple the Syrian military\u2019s ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks.  But the U.S. could also carry out more expansive strikes on like military headquarters offices and other targets, based on options discussed by various officials and experts Monday. However, the strikes carry the risk of injuring or killing Russians and Iranians working side-by-side with their Syrian allies across the country.  The U.S. already has one guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, in the eastern Mediterranean, where it could take part in any strike on Syria, according to U.S. defense officials. A second, the USS Porter, could get there in a few days, they said. The Porter took part in last year\u2019s U.S. strikes against a Syrian air base in retaliation for an earlier chemical attack. "]

The suspected chemical attack and missile strike came one year after Mr. Trump ordered the U.S. military to launch nearly 60 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base used by pilots who dropped chemical weapons in a strike that killed more than 80 people.

["U.S. News", "Under the\u00a0dispute mechanism, arbitration panels now hear complaints from corporations that\u00a0their overseas investments were unfairly treated by an action by another Nafta government. The system is widely backed by multinational businesses\u00a0because it allows them to avoid lengthy court battles\u00a0and potentially discriminatory treatment abroad. Officials from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office declined to comment on the proposal or the trading partners\u2019 reaction to it, saying the negotiations are ongoing. The future of the system, along with other dispute-resolution issues, is among the thorniest parts of Nafta negotiations, and is expected to be among the last to be resolved if negotiators are to be successful in rewriting the 24-year-old agreement. The three countries have aimed to complete the talks by the end of March, but many lobbyists and other officials watching the negotiations\u00a0say\u00a0they will have to accelerate their pace in order for that deadline to be met. The sixth round of Nafta talks was scheduled to conclude\u00a0Monday, after which U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts were expected to issue a joint statement on the negotiations\u2019 progress.\u00a0In Montreal, negotiators were able to finalize a chapter on anticorruption issues, according to an official with one of the Nafta parties. Overall, officials and stakeholders briefed say the talks have taken a tentatively promising turn, after Canada came forth with an informal proposal to bridge the gap on U.S. demands over auto production."]

Officials from the U.S., Canada and Mexico this week gathered in the Bonaventure for the sixth round of talks.Photo: William Mauldin/The Wall Street Journal \u201cI think it was a positive week. We are moving in the right direction, but there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d Canada\u2019s chief Nafta negotiator Steve Verheul told reporters\u00a0Saturday\u00a0night. \u201cWe are still negotiating, and that\u2019s the main thing.\u201d But the\u00a0complicated struggle over ISDS is characteristic of the challenges the negotiators are up against.\u00a0The\u00a0Trump administration\u2019s opt-out proposal would mean\u00a0that the country opting out wouldn\u2019t be subject to arbitration claims from companies from the other two. Mexico and Canada, according to people close to the negotiations, say they won\u2019t accept the opt-out proposal because\u00a0if the U.S. were to leave the system, as would be expected,\u00a0it would protect U.S. companies by allowing\u00a0their complaints to go to arbitration but wouldn\u2019t allow Mexican and Canadian companies to use the system in challenges against the U.S. government. The possibility of dismantling the system has worried big companies, who are lobbying for its preservation by\u00a0pressing U.S. lawmakers to insist that any Nafta deal contain some form of investor-state dispute settlement. Lawmakers get a vote on any major Nafta overhaul, so they can use their influence with Mr. Lighthizer to press to keep the dispute system. The system has especially strong support from investors in long-term projects, such as energy exploration, that might be sensitive to domestic political changes."]
["U.S. News", "Mexican and Canadian officials have said that they\u2019d prefer to remove the investor-state provision from the three-way Nafta agreement and form their own bilateral investor pact rather than remain a part of a system under Nafta where different countries have different rights, according to people familiar with the talks. Under a bilateral system between Canada and Mexico, the U.S. wouldn\u2019t be included, so Washington wouldn\u2019t face arbitration challenges, but its companies also wouldn\u2019t enjoy protections in the other two countries. One official said the\u00a0bilateral\u00a0proposal is in its very early stages but Canada and Mexico believe it is worth pursuing. While business groups like ISDS, labor unions and environmental groups see the system as giving companies a green light to invest abroad while cutting the risk of environmental fines or regulatory actions by foreign governments. The\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0has also proposed scaling back the types of challenges that companies could bring under the system. Mr. Lighthizer has expressed public skepticism about other forms of dispute settlement that result in binding outcomes for the U.S. government. So far, the U.S. has never lost an investor arbitration case under Nafta or any other agreement. The\u00a0proposal to scale back ISDS, supported by some labor and consumer groups, would only allow investors to seek damages from foreign governments if their assets were essentially stolen through \u201cdirect expropriation,\u201d according to advisers to Mr. Lighthizer and people following the talks. Regulatory actions that indirectly impair an asset wouldn\u2019t be grounds for a challenge under the system."]

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Thursday said the share of economic output taken by governments in developed economies as taxes has risen to its highest level since records began 50 years ago. But in the U.S., taxes as a share of gross domestic product fell in 2016 to below the level recorded in 2007, the year before the financial crisis hit and briefly reduced tax revenues for governments around the world. According to the OECD, the U.S. government\u2014at national, state and local levels\u2014raised the equivalent of 26.2% of GDP in taxes last year, placing it 31st out of the research body\u2019s 35 members. Only Turkey, Ireland, Chile and Mexico taxed less."]
["Economy", "The report comes as senators prepare to vote on a Republican tax bill that would further reduce the revenues raised by the U.S. government. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed changes will amount to 0.6% of GDP over the coming decade. The GOP controls 52 votes in the Senate and can afford to lose only two for the legislation to pass. The bill is slated for a vote after Thanksgiving.  President Donald Trump often says the U.S. is the highest-taxed country in the world, a claim contradicted by the OECD data. Other Republicans sometimes accurately say that the U.S. has the developed world\u2019s highest statutory corporate tax rate. The proposed tax bills would lower that rate to 20% from 35%. The Paris-based think tank said its member governments raised their tax take to 34.3% of GDP in 2016 from 34% in 2015, the seventh straight year of increase. The increase is partly driven by a need to narrow budget deficits and reverse the rise in government debts that followed the financial crisis. Denmark\u2019s government was the biggest taxer, taking 45.9% of GDP, followed by the French government with 45.3% and the Belgian government with 44.2%. While taxation is on the rise across the developed world, the burden has shifted toward households and away from businesses. The OECD said that in 2015\u2014the most recent year for which comparable figures are available\u2014the share of total taxes paid by individuals out of their incomes rose to 24.4% from 24.1%. That is well above the 23.7% share recorded in 2007."]
["Economy", "By contrast, taxes on company profits were just 8.9% of the total, having fallen from 11.2% in 2007 in the aftermath of the crisis and never rebounded. The U.S. government relies more heavily on taxes on individual incomes than most of its counterparts, and is roughly in line with the OECD average in terms of the proportion of revenues that come from businesses. That reliance on income taxes is partly explained by the absence of a national sales tax, which provides one fifth of revenues on average for OECD governments.

Depends on How You Measure It Here are different ways to run the numbers and find the best fit for each student  When it comes to assessing potential postgraduation earnings, students\u2019 choice of a major can outweigh the academic prestige of a school.

Are potential postcollege earnings a bigger deal than life-changing new experiences or a prestigious name? The \u201cbest\u201d choice depends on which priority a family chooses. And now there have never been so many tools to figure that out. For anyone wanting to compare schools\u2019 educational outcomes in terms of graduation rates, postcollege earnings or alumni debt loads, detailed statistics now are just a mouse click away. Information about schools\u2019 true costs, factoring in financial aid, is equally abundant."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "This data boom is being led by the U.S. Department of Education, which launched an early version of its College Scorecard in 2013, and has been refining the 7,700-institution dossier ever since. Other sources of school-by-school data on graduates\u2019 earnings include PayScale Inc., a Seattle labor-data specialist, and Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. In addition, The Wall Street Journal and other publications include graduates\u2019 economic outcomes as significant factors in annual college rankings. For families building their own cost-benefit analysis for specific colleges, here are five factors to keep in mind: Completing college can boost lifetime earnings as much as $800,000 beyond what\u2019s possible with a high-school diploma, according to a 2014 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Most of those benefits, however, vanish for students who don\u2019t earn a diploma. As a result, each school\u2019s graduation rate is a useful data point, regardless of whether a family is doing a cost-benefit analysis of attending a particular college or simply trying to get a sense of where a student is most likely to thrive. Because institutions vary widely in terms of how college-ready their typical admitted students might be, there\u2019s no single graduation percentage that represents a sharp demarcation between reassuring and troubling. It\u2019s more useful to focus on how a specific school\u2019s graduation rate compares with a cohort of similar schools."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "High rates may correlate with a welcoming community and strong academic support; lower rates could signal greater risks that students fall through the cracks. Ivy-caliber schools enjoy six-year graduation rates of 95% or higher. (Perhaps they offer great learning environments; perhaps they simply fill each class with students highly likely to succeed in any setting.) Flagship state universities generally are at 80% or better. Community colleges may post rates of 50% to 60%. Some for-profit colleges have graduation rates as low as 9%. Bear in mind that schools like to highlight six-year graduation rates, which give full recognition to students who needed an extra semester (or several extra semesters) to finish their course work. If you\u2019re not in the mood to pay for more than four years of college, dig deeper on school websites to look for four-year graduation rates, which must be reported as well. Of course, adjust your calculations for an honest assessment of how steadfast your student is likely to be in a college setting; if the ability or desire to do the work is lacking, outcomes can be disappointing. It\u2019s easy to shudder at nationwide statistics for U.S. student debt. Overall borrowings top $1.4 trillion, with 11.5% of all loans being either at least 90 days delinquent or in default, according to the U.S. Department of Education. That said, borrowing to reap the benefits of a college education can be a winning strategy, if students earn enough after college to pay down their debts on a timely basis."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "The College Scorecard reports three gauges of the student-debt picture at each school. Of these, the most valuable is the percentage of graduates whose debt repayments are brisk enough each year to shrink their total balance owed. The national average for paying down loans is 46%, but school-by-school percentages vary hugely. Think of it as a rough proxy for students who land good jobs (or enjoy lavish family support). If graduates can rapidly erase debt from their lives, that\u2019s a good signal that schools are helping prepare them for strong careers. If debt loads don\u2019t budge, that suggests graduates are more likely to be scrambling to make ends meet. Geographic factors matter, too. For students attending college in places where economies are strong such as Seattle, 75% or more are able to pay down their loans in any given year. In weaker economies such as Detroit, pay-down rates can be below 40%. It\u2019s hard to imagine choosing a college just because of its students\u2019 impressive success in handling educational debt, college planners say, but the opposite situation, in which many students are struggling to manage their debts, could be a red flag. A generation ago, when economists tried to identify colleges with the best economic payoffs for graduates, most attention focused on a school\u2019s academic prestige. Data at the time showed that students graduating from Ivy League schools earned more than alumni of leading state universities. Each of those groups, in turn, earned more than people with diplomas from less selective schools."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "As robust new data emerges, however, researchers are opting for more nuanced conclusions. Students\u2019 choice of a major can outweigh academic prestige in shaping future income, for example. To pick an extreme case, according to College Scorecard, the college with the highest-earning graduates isn\u2019t a super-selective school such as Princeton University, Stanford University or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It\u2019s the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Science. By focusing exclusively on high-paying specialties, Albany\u2019s alumni average $122,600 in yearly earnings 10 years after enrolling, according to the College Scorecard. None of the more famous, multidepartment universities average more than $100,000, though some of their top achievers doubtless make far more. If you want to probe the impact of different college-major choices more deeply, PayScale has free information on its website showing early-career and midcareer earnings by major. The results are as you might expect. Science and engineering majors are top earners at all stages. Vocational majors provide solid first-job income, but flatter earning curves over the long run. Average salaries in fields such as nursing, hospitality and accounting top out well short of the $100,000-plus that pharmacy graduates enjoy. Liberal-arts majors start slowly but then enjoy earnings surges later in their careers."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "For students who aren\u2019t likely to attend famous-name, ultraselective institutions, it can be valuable to seek out data on schools that do the most to help those who arrive with middle-of-the-pack high-school records and modest family circumstances. Several researchers\u2014including Jonathan Rothwell,  a Brookings alumnus now working at Gallup Inc., and Robert Kelchen,  an assistant professor of higher education at Seton Hall University\u2014have created \u201cvalue-added\u201d metrics for ranking schools\u2019 ability to boost the earnings power of average students. Mr. Kelchen\u2019s approach highlights less well-known schools such as Berea College, Cal State Bakersfield and College of the Ozarks as standouts in delivering maximum value for students with modest beginnings. In 2004, Harvard University began rolling out some of America\u2019s most-generous financial-aid programs for families earning less than $80,000 a year. The result: it currently costs just $17,882 for needy students to attend the elite Massachusetts university, according to the College Scorecard. That\u2019s barely one-quarter the official price of $65,609 for tuition, room and board. Harvard isn\u2019t alone. Browse through College Scorecard data, and you will find that for many lower-income families, it\u2019s cheaper to attend Amherst College than Allegheny College; less costly to enroll at Stanford than nearby Santa Clara University. As family incomes rise, such bargains disappear. But as college costs have soared, the upper boundaries for need-based aid have climbed to levels that would have been unimaginable a generation ago."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", " Clayton Rose,  president of Bowdoin College, says 20% of the Maine school\u2019s financial-aid recipients come from families that earn at least $152,000 a year. With Bowdoin\u2019s tuition now totaling $51,344 a year, he observes, even families that are decidedly upper middle class may need help paying the bills, especially if they have multiple children in college. The government\u2019s Free Application for Federal Student Aid (Fafsa) provides bare-bones calculators that crunch your family\u2019s income, assets, household size and other data\u2014yielding estimates of your student\u2019s need-based aid and your family\u2019s overall expected contribution. The exact extent of aid, however, is hard to pinpoint until each school has analyzed your family finances in more detail. Sharpen your research by web searches for schools that have spoken prominently in support of more need-based aid. Look up the size of the school\u2019s endowment per student, too. Big endowments often generate the income needed to provide more help to lower-income families. For many affluent families, need-based aid is out of the question. If that\u2019s your situation, don\u2019t necessarily resign yourself to paying the full sticker if well-known private schools look enticing. Tuition discounts or merit scholarships often are available for strong students, regardless of family income. Savings vary from a few thousand dollars to $20,000 or more a year."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "You can find some information about such programs on campus websites, or you can browse a nationwide list, compiled by USNews & World Report, of the colleges most inclined to offer merit aid. Among the standouts are schools such as the University of Puget Sound, Furman University, Gonzaga University and Oberlin College, all of which provided grants or merit aid to at least 40% of students in the 2016-17 academic year, according to USNews. When Bloomfield Hills, Mich., high-school student Greer Clausen was getting ready to go to college, her parents hunted for colleges most likely to provide merit aid for their daughter, a National Merit Scholar. That drew them toward private schools such as Tulane University and the University of Southern California; and to forgo any of the Ivy League schools. Ultimately, the Clausens chose Michigan State University, where merit scholarships halved the standard in-state tuition of $13,000 a year. Getting an \u201cexcellent education for less than the rack rate\u201d is appealing, says Ms. Clausen\u2019s mother, Virginia Clausen.

["Markets Main", "\nExelon\n Corp.\n      , the country\u2019s largest\u00a0owner\u00a0of nuclear power plants, placed its Texas subsidiary under bankruptcy protection earlier this month, saying that\u00a0\u201chistorically low power prices within Texas have created challenging market conditions for all power generators.\u201d The average wholesale power price\u00a0was less than $25 per megawatt hour last year\u00a0on the grid that coordinates electricity distribution across most of Texas, according to\u00a0the operator,\u00a0the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. A decade ago, it was $55. Prices have fallen a similar amount on the PJM Interconnection LLC, the power grid that serves some\u00a0or\u00a0all of 13 states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio.\u00a0A megawatt hour there traded for $29.23 last year, the lowest level since 1999, as far back as the grid\u2019s independent market monitor tracks prices. The falling prices have been felt primarily by wholesale generation companies, who sell their power to utilities, and generally haven\u2019t trickled down to businesses and homeowners. But the lower prices have allowed many utilities to avoid raising customer rates while making substantial investments in modernizing aging electric transmission networks. The price drop at PJM reflects the construction of dozens of new gas-burning power plants, spurred by the abundance of the fuel due to the shale drilling boom.\u00a0In 2006, 8% of the electricity in PJM was generated by natural gas. In 2016, it was 27%.  Weak demand for electricity also has played a role, as Americans purchase\u00a0more\u00a0energy-efficient appliances and companies shave power consumption to cut costs. Last year, power demand in PJM grew 0.3% after falling the two previous years."]

Photo: Getty Images The resulting competition\u2014by more power plants to buyers of roughly the same number of megawatts\u2014has most-acutely impacted older coal and nuclear plants, which are struggling to provide competitively priced power.\u00a0It has even begun to affect older natural-gas-fired facilities that have higher costs. \u201cGenerators are just fighting for existing market share,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, a senior fellow in electricity law at Harvard Law School. \u201cThe\u00a0aging fleet of coal and nuke generators, combined with low prices, makes this intense.\u201d \nFirstEnergy\n Corp.\n      , an Akron, Ohio-based utility, announced late last year it was exiting competitive power markets.

West of the Mississippi River, power markets also have been upended by the rapid growth of wind,\u00a0as the cost of generating power from wind turbines is falling. In 2016, all of the new generation built in the Southwest Power Pool, a grid that covers an area from Louisiana to Montana, was wind, gas and solar. The vast majority of the retirements were coal and nuclear plants."]
["Markets Main", "Wind is the fastest-growing source of power on Texas\u2019 grid. Last year, wind generated 15% of the electricity in ERCOT, more than nuclear power, which accounted for 12%. By 2019, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Energy Institute expect wind to surpass coal as ERCOT\u2019s second-largest source of electricity. \u201cSolar and wind are now competitive with natural gas-fired generation,\u201d said Curt Morgan, Vistra\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Morgan said that while he thinks natural gas will be the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of U.S. electricity markets for at least the next decade, in Texas \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a while before you see another gas plant built in ERCOT.\u201d Last week, Siemens AG said it was cutting 6,900 jobs, in large part because it has overestimated demand for its giant power turbines. The changes have primarily been felt in competitive power markets, which exist in many parts of the U.S., including California in addition to Texas and the Midwest.\u00a0In those areas,\u00a0wholesale\u00a0electricity is sold through daily auctions that favor the least-expensive sources of power,\u00a0and it is subsequently purchased by utilities and others.

The Trump administration is aiming to provide a lifeline to the ailing coal and nuclear industries through several proposals, including a plan floated by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to assist power plants that provide constant, baseload power to ensure ample energy security. But that proposal, which has to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has been assailed by critics as both anticompetitive and unlikely to reverse market trends.  An analysis by investment bank Lazard shows that on an unsubsidized basis and over the lifetime of a facility in North America, it costs about $60 to generate a megawatt hour of electricity using a combined-cycle natural-gas plant, compared with $102 burning coal and nearly $150 using nuclear. By that criteria, Lazard estimates electricity from utility-scale solar and wind facilities is now even cheaper than gas. A megawatt hour of electricity from utility-scale crystalline solar comes in at $49.50 and wind at $45. That metric carries an important caveat, however: It doesn\u2019t factor in that wind and solar are more intermittent producers of power than conventional generation sources, since the sun doesn\u2019t always shine and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow."]

In PJM, Mr. Moser said cost pressures prompted NRG to retrofit some units to run on gas instead of coal. Meanwhile, it retired a 44-year-old natural-gas plant in Houston known as Greens Bayou Unit 5 earlier this year, as the low cost of gas continues to put pressure on older facilities, even those burning gas. The company also has units slated to retire in California. \u201cIf the market isn\u2019t paying us to keep the generation around we want to take it out,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYes, you could go all wind, but then you have no answers when it\u2019s 109 in Dallas and there\u2019s no wind.\u201d  Write to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com and Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.com  \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Some diplomats believe the EU could move quickly after Monday to draw up concrete measures against Iran, although differences remain within the bloc, diplomats said. All 28 EU countries must agree on any new sanctions."]
["World News", "On Friday, the U.K., France and Germany circulated a letter calling for work to start on drawing up specific sanctions targets over Iran\u2019s ballistic weapons and senior people and entities involved in fighting in Syria, according to a person familiar with the issue. The three governments said they would be proposing specific names in the coming days.  Mr. Trump has threatened not to sign an extension of sanctions waivers on\u00a0May 12, a move that could lead to the unraveling of the nuclear deal. The agreement saw most international sanctions on Iran lifted in exchange for strict but temporary restraints on its nuclear work. Iranian officials have warned they could pull out of the deal if the U.S. withdraws. Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0has complicated European efforts to persuade the U.S. to stand by the deal, diplomats said. For now, talks among Britain, France, Germany and the U.S. on joint steps to pressure Iran are continuing, most recently in Berlin on Thursday. Senior European and U.S. officials, including the State Department\u2019s point-person, Brian Hook,  also met in Vienna\u00a0on Friday\u00a0for broader talks with Iran, Russia and China on the nuclear deal. The State Department said Mr. Hook\u2019s discussions this week were aimed at advancing \u201cthe policy of this administration.\u201d However, European officials are unclear whether Secretary of State-designate Mike Pompeo\u2019s new team will invest in the Europe-U.S. talks. Even if talks continue, some Europeans fear it will be hard to reach agreement with Washington by\u00a0May 12 because Mr. Pompeo may not be confirmed for weeks."]
["World News", "On Friday, Mr. Hook, who met bilaterally with Iran\u2019s delegation in Vienna to discuss U.S. detainees in Iran, said his talks with European officials on Iran had made good progress. \u201cThere is a lot we agree on and where we disagree we are working to bridge our differences,\u201d said Mr. Hook, according to L\u2019Agence France-Presse. On Friday, European diplomats said there are a range of potential steps that could be taken to address Iran\u2019s ballistic missile tests and regional actions. Foreign ministers aren\u2019t expected to take immediate decisions but instead steer work on specific measures in coming weeks. While the EU insists that neither of the issues should be directly linked to the nuclear deal\u2019s fate, French and German officials have openly talked about possible sanctions on Iranian firms and entities involved in long-term missile work. Europe has focused on longer-range missiles that fly \u201cfurther, are more precise and more lethal,\u201d one diplomat said\u00a0Friday. On regional issues, Europe is working on several fronts. Britain, France, Germany and Italy started direct talks last month with Tehran to discuss Iran\u2019s involvement in Yemen. Those talks are expected soon to broaden to the Syria conflict, according to people familiar with discussions.  EU foreign ministers are also looking separately at how to respond to the continued fighting in Syria, including the role of Russia and Iran in backing the Assad regime\u2019s campaign in Eastern Ghouta and beyond."]
["World News", "European officials have said that the bloc won\u2019t meet the Trump administration demand to blacklist the political wing of Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy, Hezbollah. Still, the EU could expand its sanctions on Iranians involved in the fighting in Syria and Yemen and take steps against Hezbollah fighters there. Some EU capitals are also exploring ways to curtail money flows from Iran to its proxy forces. Reaching agreement inside the EU on sanctions could prove challenging. When the bloc last embarked on increasing sanctions on Iran earlier this decade, Greece, Italy and some other countries balked at signing on, even though Tehran was openly expanding its nuclear work. Now, the willingness to bend to U.S. pressure is even less certain. The United Nations atomic agency has repeatedly said Iran is complying with the 2015 deal. Many EU capitals resent Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the nuclear deal and the bloc is embroiled in a trade fights with Washington over tariffs. It also isn\u2019t clear what European pressure will yield on the U.S. side. The biggest stumbling block in trans-Atlantic talks is Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that the restraints on Iran in the nuclear deal become permanent. European officials say sunset clauses are an important part of the Iran deal and they won\u2019t renegotiate them. Iranian officials have also dismissed talk of renegotiation and refused to discuss missiles. \u2014Julian Barnes in Brussels and Michael Gordon and Felicia Schwartz in Washington contributed to this article.

In mid-2016, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, with the migration crisis and eurozone debt crisis still fresh in the memory, and with euroskeptic parties riding high in the polls ahead of looming elections in key member states, it seemed as if it might fall apart. "]
["Europe File", "The fact that it didn\u2019t is partly due to the willingness of mainstream politicians to work together in grand coalitions and minority governments to keep the euroskeptics away from power. It is also partly due to the unexpected strength of the economic recovery and the dramatic fall in the rate of\u00a0 illegal migration\u2014but also because EU leaders agreed to defer difficult decisions. But now that the EU\u2019s electoral cycle is over\u2014assuming the newly elected Italian parliament is able to agree the on appointment of a new government, which is far from certain\u2014those difficult decisions can no longer be ducked. EU leaders have committed to try to agree at a summit in June to reforms that would enable them to draw a line under the two biggest crises that the continent has faced over the past decade.  At stake isn\u2019t just whether the EU is capable of strengthening its defenses against future crises, but also whether its cumbersome hybrid model of collective decision-making and national political accountability is still capable of addressing the increasingly complex common challenges facing the continent. The first challenge is to decide whether and how to strengthen the eurozone to reduce the risk of another sovereign debt crisis.  Proposals to complete the eurozone\u2019s banking union, strengthen its bailout funds and create a new central fiscal capacity to smooth shocks have been on the table for years. The debate has been given a fresh urgency by French President Emmanuel Macron,  who has staked substantial political capital on his ability to deliver ambitious reforms. "]
["Europe File", "Yet it is already clear that his call for a eurozone budget and finance minister stands no chance. Even proposals to create a eurozone-wide bank deposit guarantee look doomed given a stand-off between Northern European countries and Italy over the treatment of bank holdings of sovereign debt.  The question is: If a lowest-common-denominator overhaul of the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund allowed it to act as a backstop to the banking union, what would that signal about the long-term stability of the eurozone and Mr. Macron\u2019s political credibility? A similar impasse looms over EU asylum policy, where deep divisions have opened up between Eastern and Western EU countries since the 2015 migration crisis.  The old \u201cDublin system,\u201d under which refugees were obliged to claim asylum in the first EU country that they entered, collapsed when Chancellor Angela Merkel famously announced that Germany would no longer turn back refugees arriving from other EU countries. Brussels also rammed through a law obliging member states to accept mandatory quotas of asylum seekers to reduce the pressure on front-line states.  Now Brussels hopes to draw a line under this crisis by pushing reforms that would reaffirm the responsibility of front-line states to register refugees and boost EU efforts to police its external borders. It would also send illegal entrants back while retaining relocation as an emergency backstop. But while the Polish and Hungarian governments remain opposed to any mandatory relocation, EU diplomats admit that this wound will continue to fester."]
["Europe File", "Failure to resolve these challenges in June doesn\u2019t mean the EU is doomed. So long as the economy continues to grow and deals struck with the Turkish government and Libyan militias keep migrant numbers down, there is no reason why it can\u2019t continue to live in limbo.  But with elections to the European Parliament and the appointment of a new commission in 2019, it could be two years before the EU gets another chance\u2014and the task may not get any easier. After all, there are plenty of other pressing issues with the potential to deepen divisions: the need to agree on a new EU budget for the next seven years from 2020; what if any action to take against Poland if the commission continues to argue that Warsaw\u2019s judicial reforms present a systemic risk to the rule of law; and how hard to push the U.K. should Brexit talks break down. Moreover, a prolonged period of limbo is sure to intensify doubts about the EU\u2019s ability to fulfil its central function: to find common solutions to common problems.  As the nature of the common problems encroach ever closer on the core of national sovereignty, it is no longer clear that the EU system of seeking technocratic solutions based on common rules beyond the reach of national politics still works. Indeed, failure to find solutions to current challenges risks a more profound limbo, making it more likely that when the next crisis hits from whatever quarter, the relationship between Brussels and national governments will need to be radically rethought."]

Chinese coal and iron demand is still driven by the economy\u2019s old workhorses\u2014construction and infrastructure. Housing prices are still defying gravity, boosted by cheap mortgages. But construction itself, and more importantly credit creation, has already begun to slow from the heady levels of early 2016.

Curbs on domestic coal output instituted during the commodity crash were also partially lifted in September, as prices marched back higher.  Strong Chinese demand for coal and iron may have a few more months to run: Domestic supply could take time to ramp up and changes in the nation\u2019s monetary stance and real estate policies will take time to trickle down to fundamental demand. And the long, painful supply adjustment among producers means future price falls may be less dramatic than the carnage of 2014 and 2015.

Twenty-two years later, the Rangers are pushing ahead with a plan to replace the facility with a new $1 billion ballpark, with the cost split between the team and the city, featuring a retractable roof."]
["U.S. News", "A similar story is playing out is Atlanta, where the Braves are building a baseball stadium to replace Turner Field, built for the 1996 Olympics, while the Falcons are getting a new football stadium to replace their 1992-vintage one. That such stadiums barely a generation old could already be facing the wrecking ball is a surprising turn. The Rangers\u2019 ballpark, in particular, was one of several architecturally unique stadiums that arrived to great fanfare in the 1990s and 2000s. If more teams and cities follow the lead of Arlington and Atlanta, it could mean a heavy bout of spending by cities and local governments, because the public sector typically aids teams with hundreds of millions of dollars of costs when they build new facilities. While many stadiums of the 1990s were built for the long term, teams will replace them far sooner if they can get financial help, said Phillip Bess, an architecture professor at the University of Notre Dame who wrote a book on urban ballparks. \u201cThe future of these ballparks depends in some way upon whether they\u2019re loved,\u201d he said, \u201cand the extent to which owners can get politicians to pay for them.\u201d In all, $34 billion was spent on 84 new professional sports facilities in the U.S. between 1990 and 2010, according to a book that chronicles sports construction by University of Michigan sports management professor Judith Grant Long. About $20 billion of that came from public sources."]
["U.S. News", "Municipal leaders often cite economic benefits from subsidies for stadiums. But economists who have studied the issue are near unanimous in the view that such benefits aren\u2019t worth the hundreds of millions of dollars cities typically provide. Economic-development dollars tend to go further when put to other uses that spark new jobs or expand existing industries, they say. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sink more than $100 million into a baseball stadium or football stadium, you\u2019re going to end up behind, not ahead,\u201d said Roger Noll, an economist at Stanford University who studies stadiums. In Arlington, a city of 388,000 between Dallas and Fort Worth, officials take a different view. Jeff Williams, Arlington\u2019s mayor, said the current stadium\u2019s lease was ending in 2024, and the city wanted to pre-empt overtures from other cities, as the Rangers are central to Arlington\u2019s identity.  Late last month, the City Council endorsed directing $500 million in bonds to pay for the stadium, to be paid with sales and other taxes over 30 years. That is more than eight times the $60 million Arlington voters in 2014 approved to improve and expand the city\u2019s parks. The measure is headed to a voter referendum in November. \u201cIt was very clear that our citizens did not want to lose the Texas Rangers\u2014it was paramount,\u201d Mr. Williams said, adding that Arlington sales taxes have consistently grown faster than expected.

["U.S. News", "The new park would sit less than a mile from AT&T Stadium, a 101,000-seat retractable-roof facility built for the Dallas Cowboys that opened in 2009. Arlington, which lured the Cowboys to move from nearby Irving, committed $325 million toward that stadium\u2019s cost of more than $1 billion. Bonds from that stadium are almost paid off. Local critics say they are tired of the mounting tab. \u201cThis is not an activity that a local government should engage in,\u201d said James D. Runzheimer, an Arlington-based attorney who also opposed the city\u2019s prior stadium deals. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly huge subsidy.\u201d  In the 1990s, new, often nostalgia-tinged stadiums from Baltimore to Seattle retired drab, 1970s-era multisport facilities. But now, stadium complexes go beyond sports, to including entertainment venues, retail and even hotels. The Braves, for instance, have advertised that their new 41,000-seat stadium in suburban Cobb County will have three clubs\u2014one that has two bars and two 20-foot LED video screens\u2014and a hub of outdoor restaurants and shops. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more amenities for a wider cross section of fans that come to venues,\u201d said Derek Schiller, the Braves\u2019 president of business. The Rangers say the need for air-conditioning is the main purpose of the new park, with a team spokesman saying the retractable roof would \u201cgreatly enhance the experience, and protect our fans and players from the Texas weather.\u201d But do backers of the new Arlington park hope the stadium lasts longer this time? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Mr. Williams, the mayor. \u201cWe all do.\u201d"]

["Politics and Policy", "By contrast, the new Trump administration will more assertively defend U.S. sovereignty over trade policy, ramp up enforcement of U.S. trade laws, and use \u201call possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open up their markets,\u201d according to the document. President Donald Trump defeated Republican rivals and beat Hillary Clinton based in part on strong rhetoric on trade, accusing China and other countries of currency manipulation, unfair state subsidies and other infractions. In his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said he wouldn\u2019t let American workers and businesses be taken advantage of. \u201cI believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade,\u201d he said.  Some business groups and Republicans who back traditional trade policy have hoped the new administration would moderate its most aggressive policy proposals to protect U.S. industries.  But the administration sees a clear mandate to change its approach. \u201cThe American people grew frustrated with our prior trade policy not because they have ceased to believe in free trade and open markets, but because they rejected the way in which the framework of rules governing international trade operates,\u201d the document says. The U.S. trade representative\u2019s office said it has a policy of not commenting on draft documents. Congress requires the president to submit the administration\u2019s trade policy annually by March 1, according to U.S. law. The framework is a signal to lawmakers, businesses and trading partners about how the administration plans to carry out its policies. Several business leaders and congressional aides were briefed on the trade-policy blueprint and are aware of the draft document\u2019s contents."]
["Politics and Policy", "In the face of Republican concerns, a congressional aide said language in the draft challenging the WTO could still be toned down in a final, public version. The policy mainly spelled out a broad approach to dealing with trading partners\u2014including China, South Korea and Mexico, where the U.S. has trade deficits\u2014and the global trading system as a whole, via the Geneva-based WTO.  The outcome of two important test cases at the WTO could help determine the Trump administration\u2019s attitude toward the international trading system, trade lawyers say. The first is a challenge China brought when the U.S. failed to grant the country \u201cmarket economy\u201d status in December on the 15th anniversary of the country\u2019s membership in the WTO. By not granting Beijing that status, the U.S. can continue calculating punitive tariffs on allegedly dumped Chinese goods in ways that are often disadvantageous to Chinese companies. The second is a case the Obama administration brought that challenges China\u2019s subsidies for aluminum production. The WTO has only limited rules to prevent subsidies, and a ruling for China in that case could lead the Trump administration to look for other measures to challenge Chinese subsidies. \u201cAmericans are subject only to U.S. law not to WTO decisions,\u201d the draft document reads. \u201cThe Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "The draft document outlines the legal argument for rejecting WTO dispute-settlement decisions. Some economists and lawmakers fear that failure of the U.S. to abide by WTO decisions or unilateral action by the U.S. not compliant with international law will trigger retaliation by other countries. The risk is that such an approach, if copied by other countries, could weaken adherence to the WTO\u2019s rule-based system around the globe and upend seven decades of increasing U.S.-led cooperation on trade since World War II. The WTO sometimes interprets trade agreements in a way that hamstrings the ability of the U.S. to respond effectively to unfair trade practices under WTO rules, the administration said in the document. \u201cThose activist interpretations, untethered from economic realities, undermine confidence in the trading system,\u201d the document said. The administration \u201cwill act aggressively as needed to discourage this type of behavior.\u201d One trade lawyer who has been briefed by the administration said while the principles may appear more aggressive on paper that past administrations, the true test is how the administration applies the agenda in practice. \u201cIt\u2019s red meat for the public, but the question is, how do they actually execute it?\u201d Beijing is singled out in the document, which pointed to China\u2019s entry into the WTO in 2001 as when U.S. trade policy went awry. The Asian powerhouse\u2014now the No. 2 economy in the world\u2014has been targeted as representing many of the administration\u2019s worst trade-practice complaints. Mr. Trump and his trade lieutenants have lambasted Beijing for using a depreciated exchange rate to gain a competitive advantage, subsidizing industries, including through state-owned firms, inadequately protecting against theft of intellectual-property rights and using a host of nontariff trade barriers to block access to international firms."]
["Politics and Policy", "One key principle the administration said it plans to apply is a form of trade quid pro quo called \u201creciprocity\u201d to countries that refuse to open up their markets. Lawmakers and the Trump administration are considering toughening up national-security reviews of foreign investments into the U.S. to leverage better trade terms with China. If Beijing doesn\u2019t open up its markets to U.S. investors or exports, for example, the administration could use its powers to block Chinese deals to buy U.S. assets, or threaten higher tariffs on Chinese imports. \u201cThis is a completely new challenge of the WTO, existentially questioning whether we should be part of the WTO,\u201d said a senior congressional aide who reviewed the document. \u201cPrevious administrations never called that into question.\u201d The administration says it intends to update the document when Congress confirms a U.S. trade representative. Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, is widely expected to win confirmation but is facing questions about decades-old work representing foreign governments. Parts of the policy document contain arguments similar to those in a widely circulated memorandum Mr. Lighthizer wrote in 2010. At the time, Mr. Lighthizer told a congressionally mandated China commission that the U.S. could put its WTO commitments on hold, restricting imports from China until the country changes its behavior in key areas.

The moves on Wednesday mark the latest test of the economy\u2019s ability to grow on its own as the central bank dials back the unprecedented stimulus measures it unleashed through successive bursts of bond purchases after the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cThe economy is doing very well, is showing resilience,\u201d said Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen at a news conference following the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting."]
["Central Banks", "The Fed said it would increase its benchmark federal-funds rate on Thursday by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more increase later this year if the economy performs in line with its forecast. Together with the decision to raise interest rates, the balance-sheet plans show confidence in the economic expansion, which has been unspectacular but is also the third-longest on record.  \u201cWe should want the Fed to raise rates because it signals something good about the underlying economy,\u201d said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at\n            Citigroup\n.\n      \u201cWhen it gets overheated and the Fed has to cut if off, that\u2019s when you get worried.\u201d Markets were little changed after the widely expected moves. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.09 points, or 0.2%, to a fresh high of 21374.56. The S&P 500 fell 2.43 points, or 0.1%, to 2437.92. Wednesday\u2019s decisions mark a new chapter for the Fed and Ms. Yellen, whose tenure has been defined by meticulous plans to slowly drain reservoirs of stimulus that she and other Fed leaders forcefully advocated in response to the financial crisis that deepened the 2007-09 recession. Ms. Yellen\u2019s tenure as Fed chairwoman began in early 2014, as the Fed began to slow its purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities, the conclusion of the latest\u2014and broadest\u2014effort to spur household and business investment by pushing down long-term interest rates."]
["Central Banks", "The Fed stopped adding to its holdings, also known as its balance sheet, in October 2014, but it has continued to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets to maintain the portfolio\u2019s size. Since then, central bankers in Europe and Japan have ramped up similar bond-buying experiments. \u201cThe Fed has done a tremendous job helping the economy grind its way out of an extremely deep and disruptive recession,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays and a former Fed economist. \u201cIt generally operated alone and received a lot of criticism for doing what Congress asked it to do.\u201d Plans revealed by the Fed on Wednesday would start reducing the central bank\u2019s holdings gradually by allowing a small amount of net maturities every month. It would start by allowing up to $6 billion in Treasury securities and $4 billion in mortgage bonds to roll off without reinvestment, and let those amounts rise each quarter, essentially setting a speed limit for the wind-down. The limits would ultimately rise to a maximum of $30 billion a month for Treasurys and $20 billion a month for mortgage-backed securities. Ms. Yellen said if the economy performed in line with the central bank\u2019s forecasts, the Fed could set those plans into motion \u201crelatively soon,\u201d which market strategists believe could mean September or October. Officials have taken pains to communicate their strategy in advance to avoid a rerun of the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when investor concerns over the Fed\u2019s decision to slow down asset purchases triggered market turmoil, including a sharp increase in Treasury yields and capital outflows from emerging markets."]
["Central Banks", "\u201cThe plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a news conference Wednesday. Allowing some of the holdings to mature without reinvestment could push up long-term rates. The Fed has been buying around $24 billion in mortgage securities a month this year and around $17.5 billion in Treasurys, according to FTN Financial. The Fed said all participants at its policy-setting meeting had agreed with the balance-sheet plans. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari cast the lone dissenting vote on Wednesday\u2019s decision to raise rates because he wanted to hold them steady. Since officials last met in early May, they have faced conflicting signals about the economy on two items that matter most: employment and inflation. Solid job gains have pulled down the unemployment rate to lower-than-expected levels, at 4.3% in May, but inflation has unexpectedly slowed. Ms. Yellen said officials are \u201cmonitoring inflation developments closely,\u201d but warned against reading too much into a handful of recent one-off declines in consumer prices, such as wireless-phone plans, that have weighed on inflation gauges. Fed officials marked down their projections for inflation this year, though they still see annual price gains reaching their 2% target by the end of 2018, in part because they expect tighter labor markets to ultimately help firm up prices."]
["Central Banks", "Officials now expect prices excluding food and energy to rise 1.7% this year, from a projection of 1.9% in March. They lowered their unemployment rate forecast to 4.3% for the end of 2017 and to 4.2% at the end of 2018 and 2019, down from March projections of 4.5% for each of those years. The Federal Reserve stopped adding to its balance sheet more than three years ago, but it has been reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets to keep those holdings steady.Photo: kevin lamarque/Reuters Officials\u2019 median expectation for the federal-funds rate showed few changes from projections released in March, and implies three more quarter-point increases in 2018 and three more in 2019. The central bank had held short-term rates steady since March, when it raised them by a quarter point, the third increase since June 2006. The Fed held rates at near zero from the end of 2008 through most of 2015, before lifting the benchmark rate once in late 2015 and once in late 2016. Despite recent increases in short-term rates, financial conditions have eased this year, with stocks rising to new highs and bond yields drifting lower. Mortgage rates, for example, have fallen to their lowest levels since November, with the average 30-year fixed-rate loan nearing 4%. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here before, where the Fed raises its rate, there\u2019s a little bump up, but then mortgage rates come back down,\u201d said Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif., who says this year is shaping up to be his best since he began selling houses in 1984."]
["Central Banks", "Given recent increases in short-term rates, \u201cwe should be at a 4.5% to 5% [mortgage] rate,\u201d said Mr. Klinge. \u201cThere is a disconnect, and it has been great for us.\u201d Equity markets also have supported more initial public offerings. So far this year, there have been nearly twice as many IPOs compared with the year-earlier period, with around $21.8 billion in deals, up from $7.2 billion last year, according to Dealogic.  \u201cIt tells you that stock prices are higher, and people like to sell stock when stock markets move higher,\u201d said Citigroup\u2019s Mr. Levkovich. Wednesday\u2019s rate increase had been largely anticipated by investors and analysts, but how the Fed\u2019s plans later this year will unfold is less clear. Markets have been skeptical the Fed will follow through with another rate increase this year because of signs that inflation\u2019s weakness may be more stubborn than the Fed expects. Just how inflation develops in the months ahead is likely to shape how policy makers decide when to start the balance-sheet wind-down or raise rates again. Officials would want to see several more months of inflation readings before they significantly change their plans. \u201cWe have more concerns on inflation than they do,\u201d said Mr. Gapen. The Barclays economist said he sees risks of more persistent weakness than the transitory factors cited by Ms. Yellen and other officials, including from used-car prices and softer rent growth. Another price headwind, he said, looms from structural changes in the retail sector, with brick-and-mortar retailers struggling to maintain pricing power against online competitors."]

The San Jose, Calif., jury found that Arista wasn't liable for infringing a Cisco copyright and found that Arista didn't infringe a Cisco patent, representative of the companies said. Jurors awarded Cisco no damages. At issue in the case was whether Arista was guilty of copyright infringement for adopting many of the same commands for configuring its hardware that Cisco developed for managing its own equipment. Cisco asserted that Arista could have used its own commands\u2014known in the industry as a command-line interface, or CLI\u2014but instead misappropriated more than 500 commands that Cisco copyrighted."]
["Technology", "Arista argued that its actions were legal because Cisco\u2019s commands had evolved over the years into an industry standard that many companies and equipment users have adopted. Cisco, in response, presented evidence that other companies used a much narrower set of copyrighted commands. The jury, while concluding that Arista did infringe Cisco\u2019s interface commands, also accepted Arista\u2019s argument that its actions were permissible under a legal doctrine called \u201csc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire.\u201d The French phrase relates to situations in which creative works are dictated by circumstance, as in cases where software needs to be compatible with technical standards or certain hardware.  Arista\u2019s stock rose 3% on the news. Similar issues arose in a long-running copyright infringement case brought by\n            Oracle\n Corp.\n      against\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\u2019s\n      Google unit. That case focused on application program interfaces, or APIs, computer code that helps programs, websites or apps talk to one another. A federal jury in May found that Google\u2019s use didn't infringe Oracle\u2019s intellectual property because it constituted fair use under copyright law. A Cisco spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that it will review the details of the ruling and determine its options for post-trial motions or appeal. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the verdict,\u201d she said.  Jayshree Ullal,  Arista\u2019s chief executive, termed the verdict \u201ca moral victory for the entire networking industry.\u201d "]
["Technology", "Cisco is the biggest maker of switching systems used to connect servers inside data centers and to the internet. But Arista, the chairman and chief executive of which are former Cisco executives, has grabbed a substantial chunk of the market since its founding in 2004. The San Jose, Calif., networking giant first accused Arista of copyright and patent infringement in December 2014. A portion of the battle has recently been waged at the International Trade Commission, which can block import of products it finds to have infringed a U.S. company\u2019s patents.  Cisco last week persuaded an ITC administrative law judge that Arista infringed two of its patents. Arista said it would ask the full commission to review the ruling, which would likely result in a final determination in April. The ITC this year ordered an import ban on Arista hardware in connection with separate patent infringement allegations brought by Cisco. Arista subsequently modified its products to exclude technology covered by Cisco\u2019s intellectual property. Arista recently convinced U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials that modified versions of its products aren\u2019t covered by the import ban. Cisco is asking the ITC for an additional ruling to block the Arista imports.

["Politics and Policy", "Maine, for example, may limit most people on Medicaid to five years of benefits. Kentucky could require many recipients to work. Wisconsin wants to drug-test enrollees. Some of the requests were made to the Obama administration and rejected, while others are new. If the waivers are approved, as many health-policy leaders expect, the type of benefits and access some people have to Medicaid could increasingly depend on where they live, as Republican-led states whose voters largely backed President Donald Trump and oppose the ACA are more likely to limit coverage. \u201cYou\u2019d see more restrictions on Medicaid beneficiaries, and less restriction on what insurers can do with rates and design [of coverage], in red states,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette,  a senior research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute. Conservative legislators and governors in Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin are at the forefront of requesting such waivers to the Medicaid program. The proposals provide a window into how a major overhaul of Medicaid by Congress could reshape the program for low-income Americans across the nation. Republicans say such requirements would allow states to pursue innovative approaches to health-care provision that would reduce costs. They also say that requiring beneficiaries to have more \u201cskin in the game\u201d makes them more involved in their care, which can lead to better patient outcomes \u201cMedicaid is eating our lunch here in Missouri,\u201d said Sen. David Sater,  a Missouri GOP state senator who backs requirements such as premiums for some enrollees. \u201cSo we need to formulate a Medicaid program that is best for Missouri citizens and not necessarily what is best for people from California or New York.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "Washington sets broad guidelines for Medicaid, but states have some flexibility and the federal government can provide more through waivers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reviews the waiver requests, with a public comment period, and the time for approval can vary widely. The current spate of requests generally pit Republicans calling for state authority to pursue cost savings against Democrats who say such restrictions imperil coverage. Either way, they could usher in some of the most profound changes to Medicaid since its inception in 1965. Some say the coverage restrictions violate Medicaid\u2019s mission of providing health care for the needy. \u201cI find that insulting and degrading as a human being,\u201d said Tia Tabor,  49, a Medicaid recipient in Louisville, Ky., which wants many enrollees to work or volunteer if they are physically able. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re just the humans that fall through the cracks.\u201d Under federal standards, certain groups or health services can\u2019t be subjected to premiums or cost-sharing under Medicaid. Legislation in 2005 generally allowed states to charge premiums to beneficiaries with incomes above 150% of the federal poverty level. Many of the changes Republicans are seeking would go further than have previously been allowed, posing a legal and political test for the Trump administration as it decides how far to bend the Medicaid program. Mr. Trump signaled his openness by signing an executive order on his first day in office urging federal agencies to grant waivers and exemptions from the ACA."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cThere is a lot states can do with waivers, and you will see that happen,\u201d said Michael Leavitt,  a former Republican governor of Utah who advised the Trump transition.  Seema Verma,  a longtime health-care consultant, is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead CMS. She helped Indiana broker a deal under which the state agreed to expand Medicaid eligibility while receiving approval to impose new rules on some beneficiaries. Ms. Verma lauded Indiana\u2019s program, which includes premiums for some beneficiaries, at her confirmation hearing. Tom Price,  who has been confirmed as head of HHS, has also pushed for changes to Medicaid. States are eager to test the new terrain. Many, though not all, of the possible new requirements largely cover people in the Medicaid expansion that is a big part of the Affordable Care Act. The ACA allowed states to expand Medicaid to make more people eligible for the program, and 31 states plus the District of Columbia did so. The rolls for Medicaid and the connected Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have swelled by around 16 million people since the expansion kicked in at the start of 2014, according to federal data. Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich has offered a budget proposal that would require some adults in Medicaid who earn above the federal poverty level to pay a premium. The provision was rejected last year by the Obama administration. Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin submitted a waiver last year that would require nondisabled adults enrolled in Medicaid to work or volunteer 20 hours a week and pay a premium of between $1 and $15."]
["Politics and Policy", "Maine is preparing a waiver that would implement work requirements, premiums and a five-year lifetime cap for non-disabled adults. \u201cWe would not have been anywhere near as optimistic [previously] as we are with the Trump administration in their desire to provide flexibility to the states,\u201d said Mary Mayhew,  commissioner for Maine\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services. And in Missouri, a Senate bill would direct the state to seek a waiver to change the Medicaid funding it receives into a block grant that the state could control. Missouri could then design a program that may include work requirements for some enrollees, as well as copayments and premiums, said Mr. Sater, the Missouri state senator. Many of the ideas resemble Medicaid overhaul plans that congressional Republicans want to implement nationally as part of an ACA replacement. But those GOP efforts are for now bogged down in Congress. Critics say these restrictions limit care for the needy and impose inappropriate burdens on them, undermining Medicaid\u2019s promise of help for all who need it.  Dee Mahon,  Medicaid program director at Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates for universal health care, cited Arizona\u2019s decision in 2010 to stop paying for some types of organ transplants under Medicaid. The funding was restored in 2011 after a public backlash and media reports on patient deaths. \u201cWork requirements are like going back to indentured servitude,\u201d Ms. Mahon said.

There was some overlap between the two sets of stolen data, but Target didn't say how extensive it was. The entry point for the attack has been identified and closed, spokeswoman Molly Snyder said. Late Friday, luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Inc. said it too was the victim of a suspected cyberattack over the holidays in which some of its customers credit-card information may have been stolen.  The U.S. Secret Service, which often handles credit-card fraud, is investigating the matter, a Neiman Marcus spokeswoman said. It is unclear how many customers may have been affected.

Hackers could also use the details to unlock other, non-Target parts of someone's online identity. For instance, many people use similar login credentials across the Internet. Fraudsters generally combine information stolen from a variety of breaches to create a fuller picture of potential victims."]
["Business", "\"The criminals are collecting as much as they can from everyone,\" said Avivah Litan,  a security analyst at technology consulting firm Gartner. Target said just before Christmas that apparent thieves had broken into its point of sale system and stolen credit and debit card data in a hack that went on for two weeks including the crucial Black Friday weekend. The company, the Secret Service, the U.S. Justice Department and a forensic unit of\n            Verizon Communications\n Inc.\n      continue to investigate the breach. A number of states are also investigating the incident and Target's response.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the new Target disclosure was \"deeply troubling.\"  Introducing WSJD, the Journal's new home for tech news, analysis and product reviews.  The company had said the data breach, which ran from Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, involved malicious software installed in the system where cards are swiped at cash registers. In late December, the company added that encrypted debit card PIN data also was stolen in the breach. Now, it says the breach went beyond that system to one that stored the personal data. Target wouldn't say which other system was affected."]
["Business", "The new disclosure came just as Target said it was starting to see a recovery in recent days from the damage done to sales by the original news of the breach.  On Friday, Target cut its profit forecast for its U.S. stores in the crucial holiday quarter by about 20% and said sales excluding newly opened or closed stores would fall 2.5% when it previously had expected sales to be flat.  The retailer hasn't provided any estimate of costs related to the breach, which could include reimbursements to card networks to cover fraud and the cost of issuing new cards, lawsuits, and legal costs associated with the various investigations. The costs could significantly hurt results, Target said. Target is offering a year of free monitoring and identity theft protection to anyone who shops in its U.S. stores\u2014a number the company puts at 30 million people weekly.

["Technology", "Facebook and Google dominate the online advertising market. The two tech giants snatched 99% of the online-ad industry\u2019s revenue growth last year, estimated Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser using data published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Facebook holds 16% of the global digital-ad market, behind Google\u2019s 33% share, says forecasting firm eMarketer. Marketing executives \u201cacknowledge they\u2019re concerned about fake news and the problems Facebook has had with live video,\u201d said eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned that at some point this will affect users\u2014but they haven\u2019t seen that yet.

Other metrics were also strong: the number of users who check into Facebook at least once a month rose to 1.94 billion, for example. However, its share price slipped in after-hours trading on concerns about whether new ad formats will be able to replace the booming growth it has experienced with its news feed ads.  The 49% jump in quarterly revenue to $8.03 billion was a sign of how marketers are increasingly embracing Facebook and Instagram. Marketing-technology company Kenshoo, which manages about $6 billion in marketing spending a year, said its clients were spending 41% more on social-media ads, largely Facebook."]
["Technology", "Years ago, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg put mobile at the heart of the company, a focus that has fueled Facebook\u2019s growth for years. Facebook\u2019s ad prices jumped 14% during the first quarter, while the number of ad impressions increased by about a third, as users spent more time on their mobile apps. \u201cMobile continues to be the driver of our business,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. Now Mr. Zuckerberg is weaving more video throughout Facebook\u2019s products, adding more opportunities for Facebook to show more-expensive video ads\u2014but also creating new uncertainties. Video and Instagram could pick up the slack from an anticipated slowdown in advertising in the news feed. On Wednesday, Mr. Wehner reiterated his warning from last year that Facebook\u2019s ad revenue growth will \u201ccome down meaningfully over the course of 2017.\u201d Facebook also expects the ad load\u2014the number of ads it can jam into its main news feed\u2014will play a smaller role in driving revenue growth after mid-2017.  Facebook is fielding pitches for TV-like original programming, in the hopes that weekly shows on Facebook will change the way people currently use the platform and eventually draw marketing dollars that have traditionally gone to television. Facebook is now testing a way to profit from those longer videos through \u201cad breaks\u201d\u2014ads that appear in the middle of a video\u2014in both live broadcasts and on-demand videos. It also tweaked a setting so sound is on by default in some videos, a move designed to appease advertisers. "]
["Technology", "If successful, these \u201cad breaks\u201d will help Facebook convince publishers to create longer videos without the platform paying them outright, executives said. Advertisers are concerned that users will drop off a video once they see an ad in the middle of a video. In addition, Facebook users aren\u2019t accustomed to watching longer videos on the site. But advertisers aren\u2019t entirely sold on Facebook\u2019s nascent video-ad products. Facebook\u2019s video product remains \u201cuncertain ground,\u201d according to a new report by GroupM, the ad-buying unit of WPP PLC. For every 20 video ads served in the news feed, just one was watched for 10 seconds or longer and three watched for at least three seconds, the report said. Some of that skepticism lingers from concerns over how Facebook measures video-ad performance, sparked by the company\u2019s disclosure last fall that it had vastly overestimated average viewing time for video ads on its platform for two years. In addition, concerns about Facebook\u2019s handling of violent, graphic content, especially on its live-video product, could give advertisers pause, some analysts said. Facebook Live, the venue for some of the new video advertising, has been the subject of recent controversy after users broadcast violent videos such as a Cleveland man fatally shooting another man. Earlier Wednesday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to hire 3,000 more content reviewers over the next year so inappropriate material is removed from the site more quickly. Last month, Facebook promised to conduct a review of its reporting process."]
["Technology", "But demand for Facebook ads isn\u2019t expected to decline anytime soon. According to a RBC Capital Markets survey, 65% of advertisers buying Facebook ads plan to spend even more.

["Middle East Crossroads", "The smooth interaction is visible on the battle-scarred highway between Erbil and Mosul. Just a year ago, Kurdish Peshmerga troops here openly mocked Iraqi forces as cowards who would surrender their weapons to Islamic State and flee at the first occasion. These days, these Iraqi forces are rapidly advancing on Mosul, their Humvees and Abrams tanks bedecked with Shiite banners and Iraqi flags and roaring through Kurdish checkpoints from staging bases in the rear. \u201cThe Peshmerga have provided everything they could for us,\u201d said Lt.

The persistent slump in oil prices has wreaked havoc on both economies, making full independence less attractive for many Kurds, at least in the short run. \n In addition, shared domestic political struggles have turned the Iraqi Prime Minister Mr. Abadi and Kurdistan regional President Masoud Barzani into de facto allies. The link was highlighted by Mr. Barzani\u2019s September trip to Baghdad, his first in four years."]

Mr. Abadi\u2019s position, meanwhile, is challenged by his main Shiite rival, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Mr. Maliki delights in attacking the Kurds and, in recent days, accused Mr. Barzani of pursuing a U.S.-Israeli agenda in the Middle East. A success in Mosul would be a major political boon for Mr. Abadi and Mr. Barzani alike. \u201cThere was a time when both sides found it more popular and more vote-winning when they antagonized each other.

The intelligence agencies have been told to dramatically pare down the president\u2019s daily intelligence briefing, both the number of topics and how much information is described under each topic, an official said. Compared with his immediate predecessors, Mr. Trump so far has chosen to rely less on the daily briefing than they did.  The current and former officials said the decision to avoid revealing sources and methods with Mr. Trump stems in large part from the president\u2019s repeated expressions of admiration for Russian PresidentVladimir Putin and his call during the presidential campaign for Russia to continue hacking the emails of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton."]
["Politics and Policy", "U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia stole and leaked emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to undermine the election process and try to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning, an allegation denied by Russian officials. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s current and former advisers are under investigation for the nature of their ties to Moscow, according to people familiar with the matter. After Mr. Flynn\u2019s dismissal, lawmakers have called on the government to release the transcripts of his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and to disclose whether Mr. Trump was aware of or directed Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversations. Two senior intelligence officials denied Wednesday that Mr. Flynn had engaged in extensive contacts with Russian officials. One of the officials said none of the other advisers had extensive contacts with Russian officials or engaged in any pattern of contacts. Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he has heard concerns from officials about sharing especially sensitive information with Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with people in the intelligence community that do have concerns about the White House, about the president, and I think those concerns take a number of forms,\u201d Mr. Schiff said, without confirming any specific incidents. \u201cWhat the intelligence community considers their most sacred obligation is to protect the very best intelligence and to protect the people that are producing it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people in the community who feel they don\u2019t know where he\u2019s coming from on Russia,\u201d Mr. Schiff said."]
["Politics and Policy", "Tensions between the spy agencies and Mr. Trump were pronounced even before he took office, after he publicly accused the Central Intelligence Agency and others of leaking information about alleged Russian hacking operations to undermine the legitimacy of his election win. In a meandering speech in front of a revered CIA memorial the day after his inauguration, Mr. Trump boasted about the size of his inaugural crowd and accused the media of inventing a conflict between him and the agencies. In a news conference on Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump again lashed out at the media and intelligence officials, whom he accused of \u201ccriminal\u201d leaks about Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversations with the Russian ambassador last December. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t explain Wednesday why he asked for Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation. Instead, he suggested the leaks and the media were to blame for his ouster.  \u201cGeneral Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he\u2019s been treated very, very unfairly by the media,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.\u201d \u201cI think in addition to that from intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s criminal action. It\u2019s a criminal act and it\u2019s been going on for a long time before me but now it\u2019s really going on.\u201d Reviving his line of criticism against intelligence officials during the transition, Mr. Trump said the \u201cillegally leaked\u201d information was from people with political motivations. \u201cPeople are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Trump said."]
["Politics and Policy", "A person close to Mr. Trump said he was reluctant to let go of Mr. Flynn because Mr. Flynn had vigorously supported him at a stage of his presidential campaign when few people did. Mr. Trump also felt Mr. Flynn did nothing wrong in his conversations with the U.S. ambassador to Russia and had good intentions. \u201cThey both continue to support each other,\u201d this person said. For intelligence veterans, who had hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the agencies might have subsided, Wednesday\u2019s comments renewed and deepened concerns. \u201cThis is not about who won the election. This is about concerns about institutional integrity,\u201d said Mark Lowenthal,  a former senior intelligence official. \u201cIt\u2019s probably unprecedented to have this difficult a relationship between a president and the intelligence agencies,\u201d Mr. Lowenthal said. \u201cI can\u2019t recall ever seeing this level of friction. And it\u2019s just not good for the country.\u201d Several congressional probes are examining Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the election. On Wednesday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee requested a Justice Department briefing and documents related to Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation, including details of his communications with Russian officials. \u2014Damian Paletta contributed to this article.

["Middle East News", "White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that the Obama administration had been asked to approve the raid weeks ago, but the plan needed to wait for the next moonless night to be carried out, which didn\u2019t arrive until after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. But former Obama Administration officials publicly disputed that account. The raid, on Sunday, quickly devolved into a substantial firefight that killed Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was part of the operation, and wounded three others. During the operation, a U.S. plane supporting the mission had a hard landing, injuring three service members. The plane was damaged so badly, U.S. forces chose to destroy it in place. During the fighting, U.S. drones struck the house of Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, a leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP, the group\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, according to two local residents. A mosque, a school and a prison run by the militant group were also hit, they said. Local residents said Sunday that about 20 civilians were killed in the fighting and images purporting to show the bodies of several children killed in the raid circulated on Yemeni social media accounts. A man walked near a painting of a U.S. drone on a wall in the Yemeni capital, San\u2019a.Photo: Mohammed Mohammed/Zuma Press The raid\u2014the first counterterror operation known to have been ordered by Mr. Trump\u2014has kicked off a debate among U.S. lawmakers and led Obama-era officials to question accounts of its planning and authorization since news of the deaths emerged."]
["Middle East News", "Mr. Spicer, at a briefing Thursday, pushed back when asked by a reporter if the raid had been a success. \u201cThis was a very, very well thought out and executed effort,\u201d he said. The Pentagon initially said it had no knowledge of civilian deaths but on Wednesday it acknowledged civilian noncombatants, possibly children, \u201clikely were killed\u201d in the midst of a firefight, probably by aerial gunfire from aircraft called in by U.S. commandos who needed added firepower. Mr. Spicer said Thursday that the mission was first proposed by U.S. Central Command to the Department of Defense in November, working its way through the bureaucracy and landing before the White House National Security Council on Jan. 6, while President Barack Obama was still in office. The next moonless night, needed for an effective raid, would fall under Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, so Mr. Obama didn\u2019t approve it, Mr. Spicer said.  However, former Obama administration officials challenged Mr. Spicer\u2019s account as misleading. \u201cThe specific operation in question was never presented to or considered by the Obama Admin for approval,\u201d Ned Price, the former spokesman for the National Security Council under Mr. Obama wrote in a message on Twitter. Colin Kahl, who was national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden,  said in a statement sent to The Wall Street Journal and released on Twitter that the Pentagon\u2019s proposal for broader authorities for raids in Yemen was discussed at the end of the Obama administration, but the particular raid in question was not."]
["Middle East News", "He said Mr. Obama thought the incoming administration should take a careful look at the matter and questioned whether the Trump administration did so. \u201cIn a nutshell, Trump and his team owns the process and the ultimate decision--and the consequences,\u201d Mr. Kahl wrote. Despite the U.S. death and the civilian casualties, military officials believed the operation was successful. Pentagon officials said intelligence collected at the site was valuable, although the military is still doing an assessment of what it collected, according to those familiar with the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ever call something a complete success when you have the loss of life or people injured,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. On Jan. 25, Mr. Trump had dinner with military officials, national security advisers and White House strategists and advisers, including his chief strategist Steve Bannon, and discussed the mission. He then green-lighted it in a memo on Jan. 26, according to Mr. Spicer. There was no indication that Mr. Trump directed the military to conduct the mission on that particular evening, leaving it to them to determine the timing, U.S. officials familiar with the operation said. The Pentagon also countered suggestions in news reports that the mission had been \u201ccompromised\u201d before it began, although officials wouldn\u2019t say whether they believed al Qaeda had learned about the operation before it started. \u201cThere\u2019s no information to suggest it was compromised,\u201d Pentagon Spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said."]
["Middle East News", "Dozens of AQAP\u2019s fighters and three commanders, including Mr. Dhahab, were killed, the local residents said. Members of the Dhahab family have been identified as al Qaeda sympathizers in recent years and targeted by the U.S. Also among the dead was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the residents said. Mr. Awlaki was an American citizen and AQAP leader who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen authorized by Mr. Obama in 2011. Mr. Awlaki\u2019s teenage son also was killed in a U.S. strike, later in 2011. For years the U.S. has carried out drone strikes against AQAP, one of the militant group\u2019s most formidable branches. AQAP claimed responsibility for a foiled plot to set off bombs on cargo planes in 2010, as well as for the 2015 attack on the Paris offices of satirical French publication Charlie Hebdo. \u201cAQAP remains the most capable element of al Qaeda in exporting terror to the West,\u201d Capt. Davis said of the group. Raids involving American forces on the ground in Yemen that become public knowledge are rare. Sunday\u2019s was the first since late 2014. Two AQAP hostages, including American photojournalist Luke Somers, were killed by their captors during that raid. \u201cSome you may know about, many you do not,\u201d Capt. Davis told reporters Thursday, speaking about special operations forces raids.

["Politics and Policy", "The president, who values counsel from an informal group of confidants outside the White House, also sometimes bypasses the normal scheduling for phone calls that give other White House staff, including Mr. Kelly, some control and influence over who the president talks to and when. Instead, some of his friends have taken to calling Melania Trump and asking her to pass messages to her husband, according to two people familiar with the matter. They say that since she arrived in the White House from New York in the summer, the first lady has taken on a more central role as a political adviser to the president. \u201cIf I don\u2019t want to wait 24 hours for a call from the president, getting to Melania is much easier,\u201d one person said.

["Politics and Policy", "\u201cJohn has been successful at putting in place a stronger chain of command in the White House, requiring people to go through him to get to the Oval Office,\u201d said Leon Panetta,  a White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who worked with Mr. Kelly, a four-star Marine general, in the Department of Defense. \u201cThe problem has always been whether or not the president is going to accept better discipline in the way he operates.

["Politics and Policy", "Presidents have long made a point of staying in contact with friends and outside advisers; former President Barack Obama successfully argued with handlers to keep his\n            BlackBerry\n            \n      to remain in touch with the world beyond the White House. What\u2019s striking about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions is that he is circumventing protocols that advisers say are intended to help him.  Since arriving in July, Mr. Kelly has clamped down on a number of practices that aides say made the White House\u2019s internal operations chaotic in the first several months of the Trump presidency. He has told staff there will be no more patching through calls from Trump friends outside the White House who wanted to weigh in on the news; instead they would need appointments. And he stopped aides from wandering into the Oval Office to try to get time with the president. Mr. Kelly has never aspired to control the president\u2019s Twitter feed, however, which continues to create news, promote the president\u2019s agenda and draw criticism. Just last week, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets prompted top congressional Democrats to cancel a meeting to discuss the looming deadline for a deal to avoid a government shutdown.

["Earnings", "The company reported a net loss of $1.18 billion for the first quarter, including the charge for a potential settlement of a government probe of its WMC Mortgage business. Last month, The Wall Street Journal highlighted the risk of a charge tied to the talks with the Justice Department over the business, a part of GE Capital that was a large subprime lender before the financial crisis. Excluding the charge, the company said its profits were ahead of its plan. Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said the company had settlement discussions with the Justice Department last month. The $1.5 billion reserve amount is based on those talks and a review of similar settlements at other banks, she said. The reserve doesn\u2019t change the company\u2019s plans or view in relation to GE Capital, which it is in the process of further shrinking.  Revenue in its industrials business fell 4% in the period, excluding acquisitions and currency swings, dragged down by declines in its Power division, which has been struggling with excess capacity and slack demand for its power plant equipment.  On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit of 16 cents a share, up from 14 cents a year ago. On that basis, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting adjusted earnings of 11 cents a share."]

Much of investor focus and Mr. Flannery\u2019s strategy has been to improve GE\u2019s ability to generate cash from its operations. The company still aims for $6 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow from its industrial operations. In the latest quarter, those operations had negative free cash flow of $1.7 billion, compared with negative $2.7 billion in the year ago period. GE ended March with about in $13 billion in cash and equivalents, down from about $19 billion in December. The company said it still expects the end year with more than $15 billion in cash.

For now, the 27 are together. It is in all their interests to maximize future U.K. payments to the bloc\u2014Britain\u2019s so-called divorce bill\u2014as one of its biggest budget contributors departs. But even before the size of the bill is settled, a separate battle among the 27 is ahead, pitting governments that are net recipients from the EU budget against net payers, some of which are promising voters they won\u2019t pay a penny more. With EU officials talking about a \u20ac20-billion ($22.7-billion) budget gap in coming years because of Brexit and extra responsibilities the bloc has pledged to take on, the budget fight has the potential to reopen deep divisions within the EU at a critical moment in talks about Britain\u2019s exit. "]
["Brussels Beat", " Adding an extra dose of tension to the coming budget debate are proposals by Germany and some other western European governments to use the budget to prod the bloc\u2019s poorer countries into line on issues like migration, democratic principles and the rule of law. There is simmering frustration among major net payers like Germany, Sweden and Belgium that they took in large numbers of refugees during the 2015 migration crisis, while some of the bloc\u2019s biggest recipients of EU funds\u2014like Hungary, Poland and Slovakia\u2014refused to settle asylum seekers. \u201cWe really want to make clear that solidarity is a two-way street,\u201d said one European diplomat. Were it not for Brexit, the EU budget fight would already be in full swing. The EU works on a seven-year budget cycle in which overall spending levels are fixed in advance to allow long-term planning for programs and priorities. The current multiyear budget period, which started in 2014, ends in December 2020. The EU is supposed to have a new budget deal in place by the end of 2019 at the latest. Instead of presenting its budget plans, as intended, before the end of this year the EU\u2019s Budget Commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger will do so in 2018. Negotiations are due to start next summer, with Mr. Oettinger arguing there is no point bargaining over the next budget until the financial hit created by Brexit is clearer."]
["Brussels Beat", "That impact will depend in large part on the degree to which Britain stands by its past spending pledges, including contributions to the 2019 and 2020 EU budgets. The U.K. is due to leave the bloc in March 2019. \n\u2018We have got a large country, a net payer which will be departing so we need to look at shifting expenditures and making cuts.\u2019\n The EU has fixed negotiations on Britain\u2019s divorce bill as a priority issue it wants settled in principle by October. Brussels officials say the U.K. should hold to upward of \u20ac60 billion of past spending pledges to the EU. British officials are questioning the EU\u2019s right to fix any divorce bill and suggesting an agreement on the country\u2019s financial commitments will only come when Brexit talks end, expected in October 2018. Speaking in Brussels\u00a0on Wednesday, Mr. Oettinger estimated the bloc would be \u201cdown \u20ac10 to 11 billion\u201d annually once the U.K. departs. The total gap, he said, could be twice that given additional EU pledges on future defense, economic programs and migration spending. \u201cWe have got a large country, a net payer which will be departing so we need to look at shifting expenditures and making cuts,\u201d he said. Some routes to savings are relatively clear. The percentage of the budget spent on agriculture and fisheries, currently just below 40% of the roughly \u20ac1-trillion 2014-20 budget, will likely remain on a downward path."]
["Brussels Beat", "It is also likely that so-called cohesion spending, which earmarked \u20ac63 billion to 15 poorer EU member states in the current seven-year budget, will fall after 2020, with the EU offering fewer grants to the likes of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, officials say. In\u00a0a paper issued on Wednesday about future EU budget options, the European Commission proposed other ways of filling the gap, including reviving a push for Brussels to receive more of its revenue directly from EU taxes. European officials say the ideas will be discussed but member states have long preferred the current system, where 90% of the funds come from member-state coffers. That means governments hold the bloc\u2019s purse strings and can better steer its priorities. Some EU officials suggest that starting budget discussions while Brexit negotiations are wrapping up could actually reinforce the cohesion of the EU\u2019s remaining 27 members. They argue it would keep the group focused on ensuring a large British divorce bill and keep governments focused on protecting and defending the EU. On the other hand, it could end in a terribly timed and bitter EU fight. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

["World News", "Perhaps the biggest shock to the establishment came in Bavaria, Germany\u2019s Catholic and conservative heartland. The state\u2019s long-dominant Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, plummeted to 39% of the vote in the state compared with 49% four years earlier. The Alternative for Germany, or AfD, received 12% in Bavaria compared with 4% four years ago. Its tallies approached 20% in districts on the Austrian border that were key points of arrival for migrants in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis of 2015. Angela Merkel\u2019s center-right alliance was set to receive the biggest share of the vote in the German election, according to exit polls. The nationalist AfD party was predicted to get 13.5%, which would make it the first time in more than half a century that a party this far to the right has won seats. \u201cWe must now close this right flank,\u201d CSU General Secretary Andreas Scheuer said on German public television Monday morning, arguing that Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc had to do a better job in echoing the concerns of conservative voters. The AfD did well not just in Bavaria but across the country\u2019s affluent south, reinforcing the view that its voters were more motivated by misgivings about immigration than economic concerns. Exit poll data showed lower-income and less educated Germans were overrepresented among AfD voters. But around two-thirds of these voters nationwide described terrorism, crime, and refugee policy as very important to their party choice, while 95% said they were very concerned about a \u201closs of German culture,\u201d according to exit poll results published by ARD public television. Economics concerns didn\u2019t appear to play a decisive role."]
["World News", "Traditional left-wing strongholds also saw big AfD gains. In the Ruhr region, a rust-belt section of Germany once home to many blue-collar steel and mining jobs that now has some of the largest immigrant communities in the country, the party scored 15% or more in the cities of Duisburg, Essen and Gelsenkirchen. Berndt Liebenow, a 56-year-old resident of Buch, a community in the former East Berlin, said he used to support the center-left Social Democrats but gave his vote to the AfD on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s been the same old crap from the SPD and CDU for decades,\u201d he said. The refugees the government had welcomed over the past two years \u201cneed to go home when the wars in their countries are over,\u201d he added. Andrei Reikowski, a 47-year-old shoe repairman from the same district who also voted for the AfD, said refugees living in a nearby shelter were \u201cnot at all integrated here\u2026they don\u2019t mix with us.\u201d He said the vote \u201chad created a problem for [Ms. Merkel] and I\u2019m happy about that. Let\u2019s see what happens, it\u2019s created an opening.\u201d   The AfD scored particularly well in the thinly populated, mostly rural regions of the former East Germany. In Saxony, the region\u2019s southernmost state, it even took first place and won more than one-quarter of the vote, while the Social Democrats and the far-left Left party saw their combined vote share decline to 27% from 35% in 2013."]
["World News", "\u201cIf you have these kinds of results, then they\u2019re not just coming from fringe groups,\u201d said pollster Hermann Binkert of Insa-Consulere, referring to the AfD\u2019s Saxony voters. \u201cThese are people at the center of society.\u201d The AfD did especially well among men, the unemployed, blue-collar workers, and people with less education, according to the ARD exit polls. The AfD, founded less than five years ago, wants to limit further integration of the European Union, cut back on immigration and lessen Germany\u2019s focus on Holocaust remembrance. Its performance Sunday delivered a jolt to the country\u2019s establishment in part because Germans have long resisted right-wing populism. Having won 94 of the 709 seats in the next Bundestag, the party will become the first in that lower house of parliament in more than 50 years to hold positions well to the right of Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc. Its staying power will depend in part, analysts say, on its ability to deliver a clear message and survive infighting at the top. The party\u2019s long-running power struggle burst into the open Monday morning when the AfD\u2019s four top leaders held a joint news conference in Berlin. One of them, co-chairwoman Frauke Petry,  appeared to stun the other three when she announced at the start of the news conference that she wouldn\u2019t join the party group in parliament and walked out of the room."]

After she departed, the other AfD leaders promised a tough opposition and insisted characterizations of the party as right-wing extremists were off the mark.  The AfD\u2019s election platform describes Germany\u2019s Muslim minority as \u201ca great danger\u201d for the country and says Germany needs to reduce its focus on remembering Nazi crimes.

The plant uses older technology to convert lignite coal into synthetic natural gas and other gases that it uses to make fertilizers, solvents and other products. It ships the carbon that it captures by pipeline to an oil field in Canada, where it is used to push oil up to the surface. \u201cWe want to have as many different opportunities as we can to manage our carbon footprint,\u201d Mr. Greek adds."]

One contestant, a Montreal-based startup called Carbicrete, traps and recycles carbon by using it in concrete blocks. The method involves using steel slag\u2014a byproduct of steel production\u2014as a binding agent, and curing the concrete with carbon and water in a cold process rather than the traditional heat and steam. \u201cIt took a long time to get the recipe right,\u201d says Chief Executive Chris Stern.

["Business", "Shell is in talks with investors in natural-gas fields off Israel and Cyprus to supply its Egyptian liquefaction facility, according to people familiar with the matter. If the deal advances, it would allow Israel to quickly export some of the extensive reserves of natural gas found in the Mediterranean Sea west of Haifa.

The total natural-gas reserves in the waters off Israel, Cyprus and Egypt are estimated at 125 trillion cubic feet, according to Wood Mackenzie, the Scottish energy consultant. That is enough to meet U.S. demand for almost five years. The flurry of activity comes after years of U.S. diplomacy aimed at knitting together the economies of once-hostile nations such as Israel, Egypt and Jordan, and developing the Eastern Mediterranean as a natural-gas hub to lessen Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian energy. U.S. officials say they have worked to break down resistance among Arab countries to deals with Israel, now ready to tap its natural gas but with few neighbors willing to take its exports."]
["Business", "A breakthrough occurred in February when Houston energy firm\n            Noble Energy\n Inc.\n      and its partners signed a $15 billion agreement to supply gas from two Israeli gas fields\u2014Tamar and Leviathan\u2014to an Egyptian firm. Although Egypt and Israel have had a peace deal for four decades, the idea of depending on Israeli energy exports has long been controversial with the Arab public. \u201cFor Israel to export energy to the Arab world, who could imagine such a situation 20 or 30 years ago?\u201d Israel\u2019s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz,  said in an interview. The deal was built on similar agreements between investors in Israeli fields and Jordanian firms brokered by former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry,  people familiar with the matter said. The Trump administration remains engaged in the region\u2019s energy affairs, U.S. officials said, though it didn\u2019t play a direct role in the most recent deal. \u201cAn initial deal had to be done to breathe confidence into the market,\u201d said Bas Percival, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Israeli and Egyptian Mediterranean natural-gas finds have been among the largest in the world over the past decade. But the region was slow to develop because of Israel\u2019s disputes with neighbors, local bureaucracy and legal disputes. Shell, which was long reluctant to do an Israel-Egypt gas deal, is eyeing a 15-year deal worth up to $30 billion to buy gas from Israeli and Cypriot fields, liquefy it in Egypt and then transport it to Europe and beyond, one person familiar with the matter said."]
["Business", "A spokeswoman for Shell declined to comment on the potential deal. A spokeswoman for Noble said the company continues to negotiate gas sales with multiple parties for export. BP has focused on gas discoveries near the Egyptian coast, which a spokesman called \u201ca prolific basin.\u201d In the past year, BP has started production at three new fields and is planning to pump gas from another field later this year. Egyptian gas discoveries have benefited from a large domestic market for gas, with 95 million people and taxi fleets using compressed-natural-gas vehicles. Elsewhere, though, there are obstacles. Last month, the Turkish navy blocked a drill ship belonging to Italy\u2019s Eni headed for Cyprus. Ankara objects to further exploration offshore Cyprus, which remains divided between an independent European Union nation and a Turkey-dominated offshoot with disputed maritime boundaries. Exxon and Qatar\u2019s state oil company are planning to drill off the shores of Cyprus in the second half of this year, said Exxon spokeswoman Rebecca Arnold. An Exxon ship is en route to the area, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s spokesman said last week, adding that Ankara would \u201ctake all necessary initiatives to keep protecting\u201d Turkish Cypriots\u2019 rights. Exxon didn\u2019t comment on whether a ship was headed there, but said the survey ships will have to complete their work in the next few months. Meanwhile, efforts to find gas near Lebanon are running up against maritime disputes with neighboring Israel. Eni and Total have committed to drill near an area claimed by both Israel and Lebanon, adding to a broader war of words between the two countries."]
["Business", "Total says the location it plans to drill is over 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the disputed area and shouldn\u2019t pose a problem. The recent deal between Egyptian companies and the partners in the Leviathan development also still faces transportation hurdles.

The same is true in other Spanish cities. It is a mark of how the crisis triggered by the regional government in Catalonia\u2019s decision to hold an independence referendum that was illegal under the Spanish constitution and subsequently declare independence has reawakened previously dormant Spanish nationalism, including among the 54% of Catalans who according to a recent poll oppose independence."]
["Europe File", "A flag that for historic reasons had until now been seen by some Spaniards as divisive is being embraced as a symbol of national unity and defiance against what many regard as unfair criticism of Spain\u2019s response to the referendum in parts of the international media. Underestimating the strength of feeling that the push for independence would provoke among pro-Spanish Catalans and elsewhere in Spain was just one of a series of misjudgments by Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders, five of whom including the former president, Carles Puigdemont, are now in exile in Belgium. Eight others are being held in prison on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds. Many Spaniards regard Catalan independence as an existential issue for the country: the breakaway of one of the nation\u2019s richest regions would be sure to lead to demands for independence by other regions as Spain\u2019s budgetary arrangements unraveled. The belief that Catalonia is like the capstone in an arch\u2014remove it and the country will fall apart\u2014has ensured Madrid strong public backing for its hard-line efforts to respect the constitution and rule of law, which have included imposing direct rule on Catalonia and calling new regional elections to be held on December 21. The Catalan separatist leadership also failed to anticipate the economic damage caused by their independence bid. Since October 1, when it briefly looked as if the Spanish state had lost control, 2,276 businesses representing 85% of the region\u2019s market capitalization and 36.5% of regional gross domestic product have quit Catalonia, shifting their legal domicile elsewhere in Spain, according to the Spanish business lobby group Circulo de Empresarios."]

These moves will erode Catalonia\u2019s tax base, particularly if jobs and ancillary services follow.

They had been banking on support from other European Union countries who they hoped would act as intermediaries with Madrid. But while the Catalan separatists have won some popular sympathy internationally following scuffles with police on the day of the referendum and following the jailing of the Catalan leadership, not a single foreign government has recognized Catalonia\u2019s declaration of independence. Instead, EU governments in particular have lined up behind Madrid in insisting that this is an internal Spanish issue that must be resolved in full respect of the Spanish constitution and the rule of law. In particular, the EU has signaled that an independent Catalonia couldn't count on automatic entry to the EU or membership of the eurozone: for other EU member states, many of which also face separatist threats, this is also an existential issue."]
["Europe File", "Catalonia, a wealthy region in northeastern Spain, is defying the national government's efforts to block an independence referendum from taking place on Oct.1. WSJ looks at why the Catalans want the vote to take place and why Spain's central government is resistant. Photo: EPA (Originally Published September 29, 2017) Madrid is cautiously optimistic that thanks to these miscalculations, the separatists are losing momentum and that pro-independence parties will fail to win a majority in the Catalan parliament in December\u2019s elections. Spanish ministers note that the imposition of direct rule and the arrest of the Catalan leadership hasn\u2019t led to widespread disorder as some had predicted. They are also hopeful that the failure of the three pro-independence parties to reach an agreement to form an alliance for the elections as they did in 2015 reflects tactical splits among the separatists. They also believe that the separatist cause was damaged by the admission by Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell in a bail hearing last week that she regarded the declaration of independence as \u201csymbolic\u201d and would in future agree to respect Spanish law. Madrid believes that even if the three pro-independence parties win a majority of seats in the parliament\u2014which recent polls suggest is possible even though the combined support for pro-independence parties may remain below 50% as it was in 2015\u2014that not all the parties will be willing to continue the current confrontation. The crucial question is what will happen if pro-independence parties do win a majority and opt to continue the confrontation or push ahead with another referendum."]
["Europe File", "Spanish ministers are reluctant to contemplate such a scenario, but they note that Catalonia will remain under direct rule from Madrid, giving the government full control of Catalan budgets and institutions until a new Catalan leadership is chosen and could be reimposed if at any point that leadership refused to abide by Spanish law.

["Markets Main", "The readings likely cement 2017 as the worst year for this type of lending in recent history. The average weekly rate of business-loan growth was 2.7% for 2017 through Dec. 20, compared with 9.3% in 2016 and double-digit growth in the two years before that. Bankers are scratching their heads at the sluggish expansion. After President Donald Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, bankers and investors predicted that pro-business policies would lead to a surge in corporate borrowing. Instead, the rate of corporate-loan growth slowed markedly. Lending profits at banks largely depend on the dynamic between loan growth and interest rates. While recent increases in short-term rates have made floating-rate commercial loans more lucrative, the benefit has been limited because banks aren\u2019t making many more loans. Banks start reporting fourth-quarter 2017 earnings in mid-January. Analysts say the prolonged slowdown in commercial-loan growth may simply be a function of the metric returning to the normal levels of recent decades. Many bankers, however, believe that borrowers have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right time to borrow, creating pent-up demand for loans that will be unleashed any day now.

But \u201cIt\u201d proved that in the current environment, people go to theaters not based on a calendar date but because a movie breaks into the zeitgeist and becomes must-see."]
["Business", "\u201cIt\u201d has been building buzz since its first trailer, released in March, set a record with 197 million global views in one day. \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nTime Warner\n Inc\u2019s\n      Warner Bros. had relatively modest expectations when it started making \u201cIt,\u201d which is why it spent only $35 million on production. \u201cIn today\u2019s theatrical marketplace you can get extremely lucky and you can get extremely unlucky,\u201d said Toby Emmerich,  president and chief content officer of Warner\u2019s motion picture group. \u201cThis movie will be super-profitable.\u201d The film\u2019s success is good news not just for Warner, but all of Hollywood. It comes following a summer with the lowest total box office grosses since 2006 and the smallest number of tickets sold since 1992.  Many movies with well known titles and huge budgets, like \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight,\u201d \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and Warner\u2019s \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword,\u201d flopped when they failed to grab audience\u2019s attention as \u201cIt\u201d did.

["Business", "Warner has been working on \u201cIt\u201d since 2009, during which time the project survived multiple rewrites and a shutdown in production in 2015 just three weeks before it was to start shooting with director Cary Fukunaga. After Mr. Fukunaga departed over creative differences, Andy Muschietti took over and shot \u201cIt\u201d in 2016. The prior year, Warner assigned oversight of \u201cIt\u201d to its New Line Cinema unit. In recent years New Line has had a run of successful horror films including \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d series and its \u201cAnnabelle\u201d spin offs. The success of \u201cIt\u201d appears to have been driven by the fact that it is different than the sequels, reboots and comic book adaptations that dominated multiplexes in the summer but still has a brand-name title. In addition to the best-selling book, many people know \u201cIt\u201d from a popular 1990 television miniseries adaptation made by a company now owned by Warner. While the book was set in the 1950s, the movie takes place in the 1980s and nostalgia for that era among adults may have also increased its appeal. Last year\u2019s hit\n            Netflix\n Inc.\n      series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d itself inspired by \u201cIt,\u201d also took place in the 1980s. 65% of the audience for \u201cIt\u201d was over 25, according to exit polls. After March\u2019s trailer proved so popular, Warner considered moving the opening of \u201cIt\u201d up to the summer or increasing its marketing spend, but ultimately stuck with its original plans, said Mr. Emmerich. \u201cIn hindsight, that was the right call,\u201d he noted."]
["Business", "Reviews were solid if not spectacular, and opening night audiences gave \u201cIt\u201d an average grade of B+, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Horror movies typically have limited appeal beyond fans who turn out on opening weekend and fade quickly at the box office, but it remains to be seen if \u201cIt\u201d will adhere to conventional Hollywood wisdom in the coming weeks after shattering it while opening. The movie adapts only part of the 1,000-plus page book, in which its main characters are children. New Line is currently working on a screenplay that adapts of the rest of the book, in which the main characters are adults. Warner hopes to release the \u201cIt\u201d sequel in the summer or early fall of 2019, said a person with knowledge of the matter.

Output grew 2.5% in 2017 as a whole, the most in three years, and the Federal Reserve predicts 2.5% growth again in 2018."]
["Economy", "That puts the economy in unusual territory: not quite booming, but still gaining momentum deep into an expansion. The growth cycle that began in mid-2009 already ranks as the third-longest ever and is set to become the second-longest this spring. Rather than fizzling, the expansion is being spurred on by robust consumer spending and business investment. It isn\u2019t near the vigor of the late 1990s, but that was the last time growth clearly accelerated this deep into an expansion. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of history to guide us here,\u201d said Richard Moody,  chief economist of Regions Financial Corp. \u201cIt is unusual to see what looks to be a strong acceleration this late in the cycle.\u201d  Investors cheered the latest evidence of an economy that won\u2019t quit, driving up the Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 100 points, or 0.4%, at midday. President Donald Trump has pledged to return the economy to a growth rate of 3% or more, pinning his agenda on a $1.5 trillion tax cut he signed into law last month, a rollback of environmental, labor, financial and other regulations, and tougher trade positions. By Mr. Trump\u2019s standard, growth didn\u2019t measure up in the fourth quarter, but the pickup that has played out over the past nine months still has given the president something to boast about. \u201cThere has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States,\u201d he said to business and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland Friday. \u201cAmerica is open for business and we are competitive once again.\u201d"]
["Economy", "While many economists anticipate a further pickup this year, many also say 3% will be difficult to achieve over the long haul given an aging population and meager productivity growth. Several developments are helping the economy perk up. Among them: Synchronized global economic growth and renewed investment spending by U.S. firms, who had spent years hunkering down. Those factors have converged with low unemployment, tame inflation, low interest rates and a booming stock market to bolster business and household optimism and spending. Shelving manufacturer B-O-F Corp. of Aurora, Ill., spent about $750,000 to combine two factories into a larger, single plant that opened this year. The company, which builds slanted shelves in cases at grocery and convenience stores, is aiming to boost production capacity by a third with the new plant. Jamie Knorring, B-O-F\u2019s president, credits the rebound in the housing market with his company\u2019s good fortune, including a fourth quarter that was the company\u2019s best ever. \u201cWhen they\u2019re building more houses, they need to build more stores,\u201d he said, adding the company plans additional factory upgrades and equipment purchases this year. The global upswing is driving sales for\n            Rockwell Automation\n Inc.,\n      the Milwaukee-based maker of factory software and hardware, as companies in a range of sectors look to boost productivity. Rockwell said this week its fiscal first-quarter revenue jumped 7% to $1.6 billion, driven by sales to heavy industry and energy companies. "]
["Economy", "Through Friday, 26% of S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly results, and out of those 76.69% beat earnings-per-share expectations. The current growth rate for earnings compared with last year is 12.3%.  Firms that earlier in the expansion focused on boosting payrolls while labor was cheap now appear to be renewing investment in facilities and equipment. Employees perform quality control inspections on 2018 Honda Accord vehicles.Photo: Ty Wright/Bloomberg News Stronger domestic demand prodded Heartland Produce Co., which sells fresh fruits and vegetables to grocers in the Midwest, to recently add 4,000 square feet to its warehouse in Kenosha, Wis. \u201cWith the economy being stronger and unemployment being low, people have more buying power and they\u2019re spending it at the store,\u201d Heartland President Bill Dietz said in an interview. He said his company might look at opening another facility this year. Investment in business equipment expanded at an 11.4% annual rate in the fourth quarter after a 10.8% growth rate in the third, the best six-month stretch since a burst of activity in mid-2014, Friday\u2019s economic-output report showed. While they were investing more, businesses pared back their inventories in the fourth quarter, which helped to reduce output. Inventory rebuilding could boost output in the months to come. Consumers are driving growth, too. Consumer spending rose at a 3.8% rate in the period, an increase last exceeded in late 2014. Spending on long-lasting items known as durable goods rose at a 14.2% rate, the fastest pace since 2009."]
["Economy", "David Alter, 34 years old, spent much of the past decade building his savings and investing in stocks. In December, he bought a car and a second home, in Orlando, Fla., where he just started a new job as a technology manager for a major theme-park company. He said the new job coupled with a big rise in technology stocks he owns gave him the confidence he needed to take on a second mortgage, a fixer-upper for which he just bought a new heating and ventilation system. \u201cI feel very good on how things are performing,\u201d he said of the economy. \u201cBut it does make me worry like when that\u2019s going to stop. It can\u2019t ride up forever.\u201d There are other reasons for caution. A chunk of the fourth quarter\u2019s growth likely reflected a temporary boost in spending related to a pair of hurricanes that ripped through Texas and Florida last summer. Spending that was halted by the storms\u2014such as restaurant visits by consumers and construction\u2014was simply pushed back into the year\u2019s final stretch. Likewise the storms spurred a temporary boost in spending on repairs and replacement items, like cars. The global upswing is a two-edged sword for the U.S. Exports are rising, but so are imports. So while consumer spending is on an upswing, many of the goods Americans are buying are being produced abroad. That runs against Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. A widening trade deficit subtracted more than a percentage point from growth in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. That came even though the dollar has weakened, a development that should be improving the U.S. trade position by making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. "]

["Consumer Technology", "The cellular-enabled Apple Watch expected later this year would be available from all major U.S. carriers, the people said. It would likely be rolled into existing wireless plans for an additional monthly charge, similar to how data connections for tablets are sold today. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the new watch on Friday. The new Apple Watch is part of Apple\u2019s plan to begin introducing a new smartwatch every other year, just as it does with the iPhone, one of the people familiar with the matter said. This fall would be the first iteration of the watch under the new release schedule. The first Apple Watch was released two years ago. Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams has been pushing for cellular connection on the Apple Watch since before its launch, the person said. However, its development has been challenged by issues related to the quality of cellular reception and other complications that come with such a small device.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to increase the battery significantly, and it\u2019s going to get bigger to provide more power,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, a technology analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard thing to do because it\u2019s so small.\u201d An LTE connection in the Apple Watch is good news for carriers, as the new connections could help pad subscriber counts and bring in new revenue. Carriers relied on tablets in past years to juice subscriber numbers, but many consumers canceled their tablet cellular connections after their contracts expired, resulting in customer losses. A data connection on an Apple Watch may prove more useful, however, and therefore less likely to result in cancellations. "]
["Consumer Technology", "The new watch could help Apple regain its lead in the so-called wearables category. The iPhone maker shipped 2.8 million smartwatches world-wide in the second quarter but ceded top place to Xiaomi Corp., which shipped 3.7 million fitness trackers during the period, according to Strategy Analytics, a market research firm.  The Apple Watch has increased sales since it added a GPS chip last year that allows owners to track their runs, swims and other fitness activity without needing a phone. The LTE functionality would likely add more momentum to sales and could allow people to leave their phones behind, relying exclusively on the Apple Watch and the company\u2019s wireless headphones, AirPods, that were introduced last fall, said Mr. Moorhead.  The company said Apple Watch sales rose 50% in the quarter ended in June, however, it hasn\u2019t broken out sales of the product. In May, Chief Executive Tim Cook said watch and headphone sales combined for the year ending in March would equal about $5 billion.  In June, Apple introduced a new operating system known as watchOS 4.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday that he was reaffirming a more limited Obama-era policy that threatened to pull grants from jurisdictions that bar officials from communicating with federal agencies about immigration, and implied that more sweeping rules were coming. He also said the Justice Department would try to take back previously granted funding from places that don\u2019t comply with the communications law."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cWhen cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at the White House. \u201cI strongly urge our nation\u2019s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws and to rethink these policies.\u201d People on both sides of the debate saw the announcement as an early step in an expected crackdown on cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. It is also possible that Trump officials will enforce the rule more aggressively than their predecessors did. The rules don\u2019t address the question at the heart of sanctuary cities: whether jurisdictions can be forced to hold undocumented inmates in jail longer than planned when federal immigration officers issue \u201cdetainers\u201d requesting time to pick up the inmates so they can be put into deportation proceedings. President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal grant funding from places that don\u2019t cooperate.  Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news. Many cities and counties see their sanctuary policies as more important than ever given the Trump administration\u2019s more aggressive deportation policies, which focus on criminal offenders but aren\u2019t limited to that group.  City leaders responded to the announcement with a mix of defiance, certainty their policies are legal and a promise to battle any funding reduction in court. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s latest threat changes nothing. We will remain a city welcoming of immigrants who have helped make our city the safest big city in the nation,\u201d said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio."]
["Politics and Policy", "Details of sanctuary-city policies vary widely, but they all limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement to some extent. Supporters say they are needed to maintain trust between immigrant communities and the police. Many city officials see deportations of low-level criminals as wrongly breaking up families that are part of their communities, and say it isn\u2019t their job to enforce federal immigration law. \u201cCities seeking to comply with the Constitution and protect immigrant communities should be able to do so without heavy-handed threats from the federal government,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.  The Justice Department expects to award around $4 billion in grants through its Office of Justice Programs and its Community Oriented Policing Services office in the current fiscal year, which ends in September. A Justice Department official said the announcement was meant to reaffirm the existing policy issued last July and make clear it would be a priority going forward. \u201cCities who receive our hard-earned tax dollars must be in compliance with federal immigration law,\u201d said Rep. John Culberson (R., Texas), who said he helped persuade the Obama administration to adopt the policy last year. No jurisdiction lost grant money for running afoul of this statute during the Obama administration, a Justice Department official said. He wouldn\u2019t say whether the Trump administration had denied any funding based on this rule."]
["Politics and Policy", "A report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general last year found several jurisdictions whose policies likely ran afoul of the statute. That included several places that limit communication regarding undocumented inmates who Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers want detained. The report found that cities and counties don\u2019t explicitly restrict sharing information but that the policies, as applied, may have that effect. Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, reads the statute more narrowly and said it doesn\u2019t apply to communication about inmates and when they will be released. He said the announcement was meant to \u201cintimidate the hundreds of localities across the country which are in fact complying with the law.\u201d \u2014Aruna Viswanatha and Mara Gay contributed to this article.

["U.S. News", "Asked about the subpoena\u00a0Monday, Mr. Calk said he had no comment. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment. Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant who spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine, is among the Trump associates at the center of federal and congressional investigations into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election. Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Mr. Trump and his representatives have said there was no collaboration.

Investigators at both offices are examining the transactions for indications of money-laundering and fraud, people familiar with the matters have said. The Journal reported that at the time of the loans from Federal Savings Bank, Mr. Manafort was at risk of losing a Brooklyn, N.Y., townhouse and his family\u2019s investments in California properties being developed by his son-in-law, real-estate and court records show.

["Business", "Those figures don\u2019t include the full cost of staffing the trial, which kicked off in March after the Justice Department sued late last year to block it, arguing the combination would hurt pay-TV competition. The companies denied the government\u2019s allegations and added attorneys from at least six white-shoe law firms to defend the tie-up in one of the most-watched antitrust cases in decades. The meter has kept running for AT&T over the past five weeks at the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse in Washington. On most weekdays, a convoy of Chevy Suburbans rumbles across town from the Four Seasons and other hotels to let off about a dozen attorneys at the courthouse, where they join another dozen or so colleagues already inside. For busy days, company lawyers watching but not arguing the case rely on local residents paid $15 an hour to save them a spot in line overnight. The team of newly hired and in-house lawyers have filled the well of judge Richard Leon\u2019s courtroom, the pews behind it and, during crowded sessions, an overflow room next door. AT&T staffs a separate Washington \u201clegal operations center\u201d nearby while court is in session. Executives have done little to hide their discomfort with the wait. They argue that the companies could save money by merging operations sooner, helping drive down prices in the pay-TV market."]
["Business", "\u201cThe only lack of competition as a result of this transaction has been the delay of getting it to the marketplace,\u201d AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Randall Stephensontestified earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re just anxious to get moving and get this transaction put together so we can begin to bring these consumer benefits to play.\u201d The added interest payments and legal fees only raise the stakes for two companies betting on the marriage of video content and distribution to juice their earnings as their core businesses face pressure from \u201ccord-cutters\u201d.

AT&T reported fewer satellite-TV customers, while Time Warner reported that higher programming costs weighed on operating income at HBO and Turner. AT&T\u2019s original agreement, struck in October 2016, didn\u2019t plan for a merger review lasting more than a year-and-a-half. AT&T issued about $30 billion of bonds last summer to fund the purchase. Most of that debt included language requiring the company to buy the bonds back at a premium of 101 cents on the dollar if the deal didn\u2019t close by April 22. That date came and went, likely costing AT&T around $200 million in premiums, said Mary Pollock,  a senior analyst at the research firm CreditSights."]
["Business", "The redemptions still help by keeping the company from having to pay interest expense on debt that it doesn\u2019t need as long as it hasn\u2019t closed the Time Warner deal, Ms. Pollock added. AT&T had nearly $49 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter, giving it more than enough to buy back the debt. If it is allowed to close the Time Warner deal, AT&T likely will need to issue a second round of bonds that could pay higher interest rates than the original debt. The average yield on investment-grade corporate bonds has increased to 3.97% from 3.14% since AT&T sold dollar-denominated bonds to fund the deal last July, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. Regardless of whether it prevails in court, the deal\u2019s costs will likely saddle AT&T with added expenses for several quarters, according to Vijay Jayant,  an analyst for Evercore ISI.

From 2012 to 2014, Mr. Harmening was based in Lausanne, Switzerland, as president of Cereal Partners Worldwide, General Mills\u2019 overseas joint venture with\n            Nestl\u00e9\n SA\n      . His ascension comes at a time when General Mills like its competitors is struggling to make some of its older brands relevant. For instance, Betty Crocker cake mix and Hamburger Helper meals are stuck in the post-World War II era, when shoppers were driven by the novelty and convenience of packaged meals.Since September 2014, General Mills has had to close factories and has outlined plans to cut nearly 5,000 jobs, more than a 10th of its workforce. Mr. Harmening will be tested on how far he can extend the successful turn toward natural foods. Already, he singled out yogurt, a $2.8 billion line of products that drives 16% of company revenue, as in need of a makeover during an investor presentation last month. "]

The company\u2019s U.S. yogurt sales fell 9.3% in the year ended in May, according to market research firm IRI, as Chobani Inc. and other popular new yogurt brands snatched customers.  Mr. Harmening has said he would add organic options, smoothies and new brands like Go Big, yogurt pouches for children who outgrow its popular Go-Gurt tubes."]
["Business", "Mr. Harmening won over colleagues in Zurich during his tenure there with his booming laugh and efforts to learn French. But his disarming good humor belied a readiness to make tough decisions, said Luc Imbert, who runs the continental European operations for Cereal Partners. \u201cNo one questioned who the boss was when Jeff was around,\u201d Mr. Imbert said. Mr. Harmening\u2019s early anointment could also create uncertainty among other executives vying for the top slot.

After two weeks of public battle, Mr. Cote folded ahead of an important meeting with investors Wednesday.

["Business", "Talks between the industrial giants began last year when United Technologies approached Honeywell about a combination, according to people familiar with the matter, but the two companies have been unable to agree on key points, including how viable a combination would be and who would run the merged entity. A merger proposal from Honeywell followed last fall, but it was rejected by United Technologies\u2019 board because of concerns the deal wouldn\u2019t win regulatory approval, these people said. At its investor meeting Wednesday, Honeywell will steer the focus back to its track record over the 14 years of Mr. Cote\u2019s tenure.

The company went on to earn back the love of Wall Street analysts with a string of small-bore, carefully considered deals that grew the company into a broad variety of markets in which it holds dominant positions. The company now makes products ranging from oil refining catalysts and thermostats to fishing boots and Wi-Fi systems for business jets."]

["Autos", "The automobile industry and many big tech firms have promised broad deployment of robot cars in the near future, but all of the technology, regulation and legal framework needed for the practical use of such vehicles aren\u2019t yet in place. Still, industry executives have predicted with more confidence that companies could have such cars on the road in a matter of years, not decades. Other car makers have signed smaller, less specific deals to develop and produce autonomous cars, but Monday\u2019s agreement represents one of the most concrete deals between two big players in the field for the production of a large number of real cars. The promised delivery date\u2014as little as two years away\u2014is also one of the first hard, deadlines that a significant auto maker has set for rolling out a working model. Volvo has had a long-running partnership with Uber to develop self-driving cars, though it hit a setback earlier this year. Pilot projects around the U.S. were temporarily halted after an early version of a Volvo-Uber-developed vehicle flipped on its side after an accident in Tempe, Ariz. Police said the incident was caused by a human driver of another vehicle, not the Uber self-driving car. \u201cWe believe this is a new segment, a new business,\u201d said Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson.Jeff Miller,  Uber\u2019s head of auto alliances, said the agreement \u201cputs us on a path towards mass produced self-driving vehicles at scale.\u201d"]
["Autos", "Under the agreement, Volvo will supply Uber with what Mr. Samuelsson called a \u201cbase car,\u201d based on Volvo\u2019s popular XC90, a luxury sport-utility vehicle that seats up to seven passengers. Delivery of the vehicles is set to begin in 2019, with Uber calling up vehicles each month through 2021. \u201cThe base vehicles incorporate all necessary safety, redundancy and core autonomous driving technologies that are required for Uber to add its own self-driving technology,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson said. \u201cUber will adapt the software to make it ride-hailing.\u201d The first taxis from the deal will be built in Volvo\u2019s factory in Sweden. But the company plans to produce the vehicles in the U.S. as well, where Volvo is building a new factory just outside Charleston, S.C. The current version of the XC90, which is available for sale today, already includes advance autonomous features, such as systems to keep the car in its lane and maintain the proper distance to another vehicle traveling ahead. It also features collision avoidance that helps prevent low-speed fender benders in stop-and-go traffic. Other car manufacturers are racing to develop their own models of self-driving vehicles, often in ventures with parts suppliers and big technology companies. With driverless cars moving closer to reality, car makers and designers are imagining a future where car interiors look more like a high-tech living room.

Daimler has said the vehicle would become available at the beginning of the next decade."]

Waymo, the self-driving tech unit of Google-parent Alphabet Inc., has agreed to take several hundred minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, part of its autonomous driving program. NuTonomy Inc., a Cambridge, Mass. startup, has said it wants to put a fleet of robot taxis on the street by next year. It first began testing Renault and Mitsubishi vehicles, in Singapore. In May, it agreed to work with Peugeot maker Groupe PSA of France, to integrate its software into a Peugeot SUV. Volvo and Uber agreed in 2016 to jointly develop more advanced self-driving car systems. The accident in Arizona was a blow to public perception of the pace of development of the program and such vehicles generally.

["Business", "The legislative proposals could slash American firms\u2019 headline corporate tax, from 35% to 20%, though the Senate Wednesday considered a more modest reduction. The proposals also simplify rules governing tax provisions and write-offs that are expected to help dozens of industries, including big U.S. multinationals that do lots of cross-border trade and tech firms with piles of cash overseas. All that is potentially good news for international companies that pay U.S. taxes, too. But a lot of the fine print included in the two bills is also raising alarm among foreign executives. \u201cI suspect that most foreign groups doing business in the U.S. will be negatively affected,\u201d said Stef van Weeghel,  global tax policy leader at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  For most foreign multinationals, the U.S. still represents one of the world\u2019s biggest, most important markets\u2014so tax hits there can have outsize impact on global profit. Here\u2019s a rundown of the elements of the tax rewrite being watched most closely by foreign executives:  Excise Tax  The House version would impose an excise tax of as much as 20% on goods or services a foreign company sells in the U.S. via its local subsidiary. Companies would be able to choose to avoid the excise tax on their U.S. unit. But in return all income from U.S. sales would be taxed stateside, in addition to accruing tax, in some cases, in a company\u2019s home jurisdiction. The measures\u2014if they make it into law\u2014could conflict with bilateral tax agreements and contravene World Trade Organization rules, tax experts say."]

Why is so much money offshore, and how could the tax code be changed to bring it back? WSJ's tax reporter Richard Rubin dives in.

["Business", " Tax Deductions for U.S. Units  The Senate version includes language that would curb the tax deductions multinationals can now take on debt carried by their U.S. affiliates. That would water down a current incentive to load American units up with debt.  Foreign Airlines  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R., Ga.) has proposed an amendment to the Senate version that could raise costs from some foreign airlines flying to the U.S. Airlines generally pay tax at home and aren\u2019t subject to U.S. income tax even for their American activities. The amendment, if enacted, would eliminate that exclusion for foreign airlines whose own markets aren\u2019t served by significant flights by U.S. carriers.  Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said the proposed amendment \u201cis widely agreed to be inappropriate under U.S. law and contrary to several international agreements.\u201d  Repatriation Holiday  Both chambers propose a one-time tax break for U.S. companies to repatriate profits earned overseas. Currently, American firms have hoarded cash offshore, eager to avoid the high U.S. corporate tax they would incur if they brought it home. Apple Inc., for instance, has about $252 billion in cash abroad. The House version proposes a one-time corporate tax rate of 14% for repatriated cash, while the Senate is proposing 10%. The tax would also apply if the cash is kept abroad.

["Africa News", "The 84-year-old Mr. Tshisekedi had been ill for some time, but in an indication of the sway he still held in the country, his return to the capital Kinshasa from medical treatment abroad in July was greeted by thousands of supporters and revived opposition to Mr. Kabila\u2019s move to stay on for an extra, unconstitutional term in office. He rallied other opposition parties to sign on to a transition plan brokered by Catholic Church leaders on New Year\u2019s Eve that calls for national elections by the end of 2017 and bars Mr. Kabila from running again. Mr. Tshisekedi was to head the council overseeing implementation of the agreement. \u201cHis death marks a huge setback for the transition deal, as a younger generation of political figures compete to take the mantle of the opposition\u2019s figurehead,\u201d said Charles Pembroke,  an analyst with PGI Intelligence.

The opposition has nominated Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s son, Felix Tshisekedi, for prime minister, but Mr. Kabila\u2019s government insists that five names should be put forward to allow the president to choose one."]
["Africa News", "Analysts have warned that updating voter lists and distributing ballots across a country roughly the size of Western Europe by December would be tight even if implementation had already begun.

He served several short terms as prime minister in the 1990s, as Mr. Mobutu courted the opposition to calm public anger against his increasingly unpopular regime. After Mr. Mobutu was overthrown in 1997 and the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Tshisekedi led the opposition but never became president. He boycotted Congo\u2019s first democratic elections in 2006 and then was runner-up in the 2011 vote, which was widely criticized as fraudulent. When Mr. Kabila refused to step down at the end of his term in December, Mr. Tshisekedi called for nationwide protests, sparking days of deadly clashes across several cities."]

["Media & Marketing", "A critical mass of programs about home renovations, cooking contests and the like put Discovery and Scripps in a position to offer a web-TV bundle directly to consumers, who are \u201ccutting the cord\u201d to cable at a fast pace and turning to slimmed-down offerings from Hulu and other competitors. It will also give the combined firm more heft with programming distributors that are under pressure to curb monthly cable fees passed through to media companies. News of the deal overshadowed the companies\u2019 quarterly earnings reports, both of which fell short of Wall Street expectations. That prompted Marci Ryvicker, an analyst at Wells Fargo, to put out a note titled: \u201cWell, Good Thing They\u2019re Combining Because Q2 Results Were Underwhelming.\u201d  Discovery shares closed 8.2% lower at $24.60 on Monday, while Scripps rose 0.6% to $87.41. Under the terms of the agreement, announced Monday morning, Scripps shareholders will receive $90 a share, $63 of which will be in cash and $27 a share in Class C Common shares of Discovery stock. The price is a 34% premium to the level where Scripps shares were trading before The Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks. Including Scripps\u2019s debt, the deal is valued at a total of $14.6 billion.  The seeds of Monday\u2019s deal were planted last November. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav and Scripps CEO Ken Lowe participated in a panel discussion about family values in the media at the Vatican, where they met with Pope Francis. The two have been close friends for three decades and often spend time together in East Hampton, N.Y. "]
["Media & Marketing", "Over dinner in Rome, the pair discussed the challenges facing their companies and initiatives in getting content straight to the consumer. Mr. Zaslav\u2019s interest in Scripps increased when he saw how strongly Scripps programminghad performed in Latin America. Executives at Discovery\u2019s Home & Health channel earlier this year suggested that Mr. Zaslav reach out to Mr. Lowe to acquire more content, but Mr. Zaslav already was thinking of a deeper relationship, a person with knowledge of the matter said. When Scripps executives in May started to put out feelers to potential suitors, including\n        Viacom\n Inc.,\n      Discovery approached them soon after, people familiar with the matter said. At the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, early last month, Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Lowe were inseparable. Last week, Scripps informed Viacom that it was passing on its offer to focus on Discovery. Mr. Zaslav and his wife spent Saturday at Mr. Lowe\u2019s Knoxville, Tenn., home, where they had lunch as Scripps\u2019s board contemplated the deal. Discovery owns networks including Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. Scripps operates HGTV, Cooking Channel and Food Network among others. The two companies account for 13% of overall cable viewership but receive just 7% of the monthly cable fees consumers pay, according to RBC Capital Markets. The merged company will control four of the five major cable networks with the highest percentages of female viewers\u2014TLC, HGTV, Investigation Discovery and Food Network, according to Nielsen. Advertisers want female viewers because they tend to have a big say in household purchases. "]
["Media & Marketing", "Discovery said it would be able to expand Scripps\u2019s channels into more overseas markets, which could help generate significant additional revenue. The combined company is also touting its short-form video production, which will help it gain more viewers and ad dollars on social-media platforms. The deal could put pressure on other media companies that must defend their turf on the cable dial. Industry experts say\n            AMC Networks\n Inc.\n      could be the next compelling target. It isn\u2019t part of a big conglomerate that owns broadcast or sports networks, which cable distributors find most difficult to drop. An AMC spokeswoman declined to comment. The deal will lift the profile of Mr. Zaslav, who had a roughly two-decade career at NBC before joining Discovery in 2007. He has led a transition of Discovery from being primarily known for its serious educational fare to a mix of documentary-style programming and over-the-top reality TV\u2014shows like \u201cHere Comes Honey Boo Boo\u201d and \u201cNaked and Afraid.\u201d Lately, the pendulum at the company has swung back to content with higher aspirations. Female Power / Most female-skewing cable channels among the top 20 networks.Source: Nielsen He has launched new channels, including crime-focused Investigation Discovery, which has become a huge hit with female viewers. And he has been as aggressive as any media CEO in international expansion: Operations outside the U.S. accounted for 47% of the company\u2019s $6.5 billion in total revenue last year."]
["Media & Marketing", "Discovery said second-quarter revenue rose 2% to $1.75 billion, shy of analysts\u2019 estimates. Scripps lowered its revenue guidance and reported second-quarter U.S. advertising sales growth of 2.2%, which also fell short of expectations. The deal is expected to close by early 2018, pending approval by shareholders and regulators. Mr. Zaslav is a close associate of John Malone,  the cable mogul who owns a nearly one-third voting stake in Discovery and sits on its board. Mr. Malone, who has significant interests in companies from\n            Liberty Media\n Corp.\n      to\n            Charter Communications\n Inc.,\n      has been a driving force in the industry\u2019s mergers and acquisitions and has talked up the need for small players in the content world to merge, particularly as cable and broadband providers have gone through their own wave of big deals.

AT&T Inc. agreed last year to buy\n            Time Warner\n Inc.\n Discovery Communications CEO David ZaslavPhoto: Richard Shotwell/Associated Press Mr. Zaslav didn\u2019t rule out other deals. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of bullets. We still have room to do some selective purchases,\u201d he said. Discovery is securing a purchase of Scripps after more than one failed attempt over the last decade. Three years ago, talks between the two companies broke down, in part because the Scripps family didn\u2019t appear ready to sell."]
["Media & Marketing", "The family, which collectively controls 91.8% of Scripps voting shares, entered into an agreement to vote in favor of the deal, as did Mr. Malone and the Newhouse family, which is also a major Discovery shareholder. After closing, Scripps shareholders will own about 20% of Discovery\u2019s shares and Discovery investors will own 80%. The acquisition is expected to create about $350 million in cost savings and add to adjusted earnings in the first year, Discovery said.

["U.S. News", "Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said Tuesday that the agreement \u201cshould not be interpreted as a judgment on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial.\u201d Charges against some officers include second-degree murder and manslaughter. All have pleaded not guilty.  \u201cThis settlement is being proposed solely because it is in the best interest of the city, and avoids costly and protracted litigation that would only make it more difficult for our city to heal and potentially cost taxpayers many millions more in damages,\u201d Ms. Rawlings-Blake said in a statement. Richard Shipley, Mr. Gray\u2019s stepfather, declined comment. Lawyers for Mr. Gray\u2019s family have scheduled a news conference Wednesday to discuss the settlement. Mr. Gray, 25 years old, was arrested on April 12 in West Baltimore after authorities said he made eye contact with a police sergeant and ran. Prosecutors have alleged he suffered a fatal injury after police placed him in van without a seat belt and with his legs shackled and hands cuffed. Authorities said by the time the van reached the police station, Mr. Gray wasn\u2019t breathing and had gone into cardiac arrest. He died April 19. Rioting erupted hours after Mr. Gray\u2019s April 27 funeral. Gov. Larry Hogan sent in Maryland National Guard troops to help restore order, and Ms. Rawlings-Blake imposed a five-night curfew. The proposed settlement doesn\u2019t constitute an admission of liability on the part of the city, the police department or any police officers, Ms. Rawlings-Blake\u2019s office said. Under the agreement, $2.8 million would be paid this year and $3.6 million next fiscal year."]
["U.S. News", "Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the city\u2019s police union, criticized the proposed agreement. He said the notion that there is any reason to settle while criminal charges against the officers are pending \u201cis obscene and without regard to the fiduciary responsibility owed to the taxpaying citizens of the city.\u201d A mural of Freddie Gray stands in the Sandtown neighborhood of Baltimore, on  Aug. 26, where rioting erupted after his death.Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Baltimore paid out $12 million in settlements and court judgments in police-misconduct cases from 2010 through 2014, according to data obtained by the by The Wall Street Journal through a public records request. The annual payouts in these cases, which include excessive force and false arrest claims, dipped in Baltimore from $4.4 million in 2010 to $1.6 million in 2014, according to the data. The city paid out another $4.2 million related to car-collision claims involving police over those five years. Under Maryland law, someone injured by police can collect a maximum of $400,000 from local government in a civil lawsuit, but government officials can agree to higher payouts, as Baltimore officials have done in Mr. Gray\u2019s case.  The accord comes as police misconduct payouts are rising nationally. In July, New York City agreed to a $5.9 million settlement with the estate of Eric Garner, whose death after being put in a police chokehold in 2014 led to widespread protests. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said at the time that the settlement \u201cacknowledges the tragic nature of Mr. Garner\u2019s death while balancing my office\u2019s fiscal responsibility to the city.\u201d The city didn\u2019t admit liability."]

["Heard on the Street", "Sterling and stocks, which were uncorrelated before the vote, became negatively correlated. Sterling has made a big difference to returns: in local-currency terms the FTSE100 is up 17% since the vote; in dollar terms it is little changed. But things might not be so simple now. Sterling is up 3% against the dollar this year. The last week has seen new underpinning emerge for the currency with a surprising shift toward tighter monetary policy from a number of Bank of England rate-setting officials. Uncertainty around Brexit means sterling faces challenges in marching higher from here, but the currency tailwind for the FTSE 100 has faded. And it is the economies on the other side of the negotiations that are now on the march. Eurozone stocks have fared better this year as political risks on the Continent have declined and growth has accelerated. International investors may bypass the U.K. if they are coming to Europe. The U.K. economy faces a wage squeeze and the reality of Brexit may yet lead to disruption for companies. The clock is now ticking on the Brexit talks, and the hard yards lie ahead.

"]
["Business", "Whole Foods co-Chief Executives John Mackey and Walter Robb made a video apology on July 1, saying the mislabeling was an inadvertent error by employees and that it also led to some incorrectly low weights.

The first one will be in the Los Angeles area in a location initially targeted for a Whole Foods store.

The deliveries are part of a 100 aircraft order Iran Air placed with Airbus. The airline also plans to take delivery of 80 long- and short-range planes from Boeing. The orders are worth more than $34.5 billion at list price, though buyers typically get deep discounts. The aircraft deals have angered U.S. lawmakers opposed to the nuclear deal that Western powers agreed to with Iran. The accord struck in 2015 eases sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran agreeing on limits to its nuclear program. Congressional critics of the pact have tried to block the aircraft sales from proceeding, introducing legislative measures to bar financing the purchases. Before his election, U.S. President Donald Trump was critical of the nuclear deal, but hasn\u2019t said whether he will try to undo the deals since taking office in January. Big plane-leasing companies have said they are reluctant to place planes in Iran until there is greater certainty over U.S. policy toward Iran. Other companies also have slowed efforts to do business in Iran following the election of Mr. Trump. Iran is in dire need of modern planes.

While the scale of the breach pales in comparison to recent disclosures from Yahoo Inc. and\n            Equifax\n Inc.,\n      Uber\u2019s attempts to keep it quiet raise questions about how many people knew about it and whether officers still at the company were part of the effort. The New York State Attorney General\u2019s office has opened an investigation into the breach, a spokeswoman said in an email Tuesday. She didn\u2019t give further details.

The coverup is another challenge for the recently hired CEO, who in less than three months on the job has tried to bring stability after a year of controversies and missteps that took place under Mr. Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder. Valued at $68 billion by investors, Uber has developed a reputation for pushing the limits of the law in its pursuit of dominating the ride-hailing market."]
["Technology", "As Uber CEO, Mr. Khosrowshahi has inherited several federal probes of the company over programs targeting rivals and regulators, as a well as a possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Uber is in a heated legal battle with Google parent Alphabet Inc., which filed suit in February alleging the company stole trade secrets related to self-driving cars. And it is trying to recover from claims by a former female engineer that management ignored complaints from her and other women of sexism and harassment.  The company has said it is cooperating with federal regulators in their investigations. It disputes the allegations made by Alphabet and is contesting the lawsuit in court.  Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s short reign at Uber has been riddled with infighting among directors, particularly between Mr. Kalanick and investor Benchmark Capital over the company\u2019s corporate governance. In the midst of all this, he has spent weeks negotiating a deal for SoftBank Group Inc. to invest upward of $10 billion in the company through a direct investments and stake purchases from employees and other investors. SoftBank is working to determine a price at which it will offer to buy billions of shares through a tender offer from existing investors at a discount to Uber\u2019s $68 billion valuation, according to people familiar with the matter. Uber disclosed the breach ahead of the tender offer because it could be considered material to investors, the people said. It\u2019s unclear if SoftBank may use the disclosure as a negotiating chit, and a spokesman for the Japanese investor declined to comment."]

The company said it took \u201cimmediate steps\u201d to secure the data and shut down unauthorized access while strengthening its security controls. But Uber said it failed to disclose the breach to authorities, customers and drivers, and after Mr. Khosrowshahi learned of the coverup, he ordered an investigation into the circumstances behind the breach and fired Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Clark.

["Politics and Policy", "Republican senators said they recognized passing a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d would essentially postpone tough decisions on health care until later, but they seized on it as potentially their best option as the Senate this week began considering and rapidly discarding other plans, with no alternative appearing likely to attract the 50 Republican votes needed to pass. A measure to repeal most of former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 health law, with a two-year expiration date to allow lawmakers to craft a replacement, failed in a 45-55 vote on Wednesday, as seven GOP senators joined all Democrats in voting against it. That came after the latest version of the broader Senate Republican bill was defeated 43-57 on Tuesday, leaving the leaders with few options.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has pitched the skinny repeal plan in recent days. GOP leaders say that passing it could be their only alternative to giving up on a health overhaul, and that the bill could be improved in Senate-House talks. With no other plan capable of unifying Republicans, the skinny repeal plan gained traction with senators from the party\u2019s conservative and centrist wings, as well as rank-and-file Republicans who didn\u2019t want the health-care push to die in their chamber. The House narrowly passed a far more sweeping bill in May. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for months we should start with what we agree on, and try to build up,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.). \u201cThe previous strategy was to start big and try to have the whole kitchen sink in there.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", " The proposal under discussion would likely end the much-debated requirement under the Affordable Care Act that most people have insurance or pay a penalty. It would also overturn the requirement that most employers provide health insurance to their workers. But it would leave in place much of the broad shape of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law, including the expansion of the Medicaid program for low-income Americans in 31 states; regulations that require insurers to cover people regardless of their health status; and a mandate that most health plans cover a raft\u00a0of specific benefits such as maternity care. Republicans haven\u2019t been able to agree on how, or whether, to modify or cut those elements. Insurers and Democrats reacted with alarm to the idea that Republicans might pass the scaled-back bill. Health insurers warn of the danger of ending the individual insurance mandate without other provisions to prod young, healthy people to buy insurance. Without such efforts, individual insurance markets have in the past gone into meltdowns known as \u201cdeath spirals,\u201d they say, meaning cycles of rising premiums and shrinking enrollment, leaving insurers covering the sickest, costliest patients. Medicaid is known for providing health services to women and children, but more money is spent on the elderly and disabled. Here's how Medicaid works \u2014 and why it's being debated in Congress as part of repealing Obamacare. Photo: Getty"]
["Politics and Policy", "Some GOP senators, including Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Mike Lee of Utah, were undecided on the idea Wednesday, and it\u2019s not clear it will have the votes to pass. Mr. McConnell presides over a narrow 52-48 Republican majority and can lose no more than two Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a potential 50-50 tie. The proposal appealed to some centrist Republicans, who have been uneasy over $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding that was part of earlier GOP proposals. Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.) said he appreciated that the skinny repeal did not seek to make cuts to federal funding for Medicaid and viewed it \u201cfavorably\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cRight now Medicaid expansion has worked for the state of Nevada,\u201d he said.  But Mr. Heller and other senators acknowledged that passing such a measure would open up unpredictable negotiations with House Republicans, who would likely lobby to return Medicaid cuts and other conservative measures. The House could take up and pass the skinny repeal bill as is, if it clears the Senate, but that appears unlikely as a first step. Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen conservative lawmakers, said he would oppose such a move. \u201cWould we send that to the president? The answer is no,\u201d Mr. Meadows told reporters, saying a scaled-back Senate bill should serve only to jump-start negotiations."]
["Politics and Policy", "But striking a broader compromise between the two chambers wouldn\u2019t be easy, given the deep divisions between Republicans on a variety of issues, including whether, how much and how quickly to cut Medicaid funding. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) warned that Republicans have to see the pared-back legislation as a good enough product to become law, in case the House decided to simply pick it up and pass it. \u201cIf it represents what we can do, hopefully we can improve on it and get it in shape in conference with the House,\u201d he said. But \u201cmaybe the House will pick up what we pass.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price signaled support for the skinny repeal plan Wednesday, urging lawmakers to vote in favor of any measure that stands a chance of passing. \u201cWhat we need to do in the Senate is figure out what the lowest common denominator is,\u201d he said on CNBC. \u201cWhatever can get us to 50 votes so that we can move forward on a health-care reform legislation.\u201d Indeed, Republican leaders\u2019 strategy at this point is to keep the health push alive as long as needed, in the hopes of striking a deal at some point despite having no road map on how to do so. Previously, Mr. McConnell had signaled he would move on to other issues if a health plan stalled in the Senate."]
["Politics and Policy", "In a move that could siphon support for the skinny repeal proposal, a group of five GOP governors and five Democratic governors pressed senators to abandon the idea. The governors wrote in a letter to Senate leaders Wednesday night that a skinny repeal plan is \u201cexpected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.\u201d They instead urged senators to work with governors and colleagues from both parties to shore up the individual insurance market.  Attacking the proposal, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday the skinny plan would boost premiums for many Americans, in part because Senate passage would usher in a period of uncertainty. \u201cThe Senate Republicans will be responsible for every dollar of premium increases that occur over the weeks and months that follow, as this bill sits in a conference with the House and insurance companies jack up prices because they don\u2019t know what they might be required to cover,\u201d Ms. Warren said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday night that Democrats wouldn\u2019t offer any amendments until GOP leaders had unveiled their final version of a health-care bill. About 15 million fewer people would have coverage in 10 years if the ACA individual mandate is repealed, according to an estimate last year from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Premiums on the individual market would increase 20% because healthier and younger people, who help offset the costs of older and sicker consumers, would likely drop coverage, the CBO found."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cA system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone,\u201d Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement on Wednesday. A new CBO analysis released Wednesday night, which was requested by Democrats based on reports of the skinny repeal plan, pegs the number of additional uninsured at 16 million over the next decade.  The Senate\u2019s failure to pass the repeal-only proposal on Wednesday was notable in part because of the 52 current GOP senators, 49 voted for the same repeal bill in 2015. Ms. Collins was the only current Republican senator to vote against it at the time. But some senators said conditions had changed. \u201cIn 2015, we could have waited two years for relief, but we cannot now,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said after the vote. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tennesseans would be comfortable canceling insurance for 22 million Americans and trusting Congress to find a replacement in two years.

["Asia News", "Pyongyang has been pursuing two tracks toward developing nuclear weapons, using both plutonium and uranium. The U.S. believes North Korea\u2019s first five tests have been plutonium bombs. But if uranium is used in the next test, it could suggest the North has a much larger arsenal than initially believed. Current estimates are that the country has between 20 and 40 atomic weapons. Also, North Korea has said it\u2019s seeking to develop hydrogen bombs, which have much larger explosive impact than conventional nuclear weapons. U.S. officials have said North Korea might have detonated a \u201cboosted\u201d device last September, meaning it used tritium to amplify the fissile reaction of the bomb. This technology is seen as a crucial element in development hydrogen bombs.

["Politics and Policy", "\u201cYou could feel it dripping with venom,\u201d one dinner guest said of Mr. Trump\u2019s comment. \u201cIt was something else.\u201d Others in the room characterized the conversation about Mr. Sessions as less tense. \u201cHe\u2019s candid, which shows respect for his guests,\u201d said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp. \u201cIt was friends getting together and dishing on politics and the state of the country,\u201d said Mr. Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, works in the White House communications office. He called the dinner \u201ccordial.\u201d Mr. Trump was answering a guest\u2019s question on a policy technicality when his mood appeared to shift, the people said. He advised the guest to reach out to the attorney general on the issue, then said of Mr. Sessions: \u201cHe recused himself on Russia, which he should never have done.\u201d Mr. Trump also suggested Mr. Sessions was ineffective at his job. \u201cHe basically told everyone in the room to go tell Sessions to get moving\u201d on various policy fronts, one person said. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, President Trump continued to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his decision to recuse himself from any Russia related investigations.

["Politics and Policy", "Mr. Trump also said his feud with the NFL, some of whose players he has spent recent days attacking for kneeling in protest during the national anthem, had \u201creally taken off,\u201d according to a person present for the conversation. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in recent days have sparked protests that are unprecedented in NFL history. \u201cHe was happy. He feels like he\u2019s clearly winning that exchange,\u201d the person said. A White House spokeswoman said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to comment about rumors on private conversations.\u201d A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. In March, Mr. Sessions, a former U.S. senator from Alabama and early supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential effort, said he would remove himself from involvement in any Justice Department investigation related to the 2016 presidential race, following the disclosure that he had had conversations with the Russian ambassador while advising the Trump campaign. In addition, Justice Department regulations required him to recuse himself from any investigations involving political campaigns to which he served as an adviser. Mr. Trump has blamed Mr. Sessions\u2019 recusal from the probe for the Justice Department\u2019s appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel in charge of the investigation, which the president has called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment came days after Mr. Trump fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey,  who had been heading the probe."]
["Politics and Policy", "In July, Mr. Trump criticized his attorney general\u2019s leadership of the FBI, called him \u201cbeleaguered\u201d and declined to say in an interview with The Wall Street Journal whether he would fire him. He also told the New York Times he never would have hired Mr. Sessions had he known he would recuse himself from the Russia probe. During Monday\u2019s dinner, Mr. Trump also discussed health care and tax reform. He said the White House was still \u201cvery serious\u201d about passing Republicans\u2019 latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, although the legislation suffered a likely death blow earlier in the day when Sen. Susan Collins\u2019s declared opposition left it without enough votes to pass. Mr. Trump called Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who said last week he wouldn\u2019t support the health-care bill, \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d The conversation also turned to vacant court seats. Mr. Trump\u2019s guests praised him and his administration for the successful confirmation process of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch earlier this year.

The...\n \nWhole Foods Market\n Inc.\u2019s\n      plan to return to one chief from a dual-CEO setup the past six years raises fresh questions about its future strategy to battle a slump in sales. The struggling grocery chain said late Wednesday that co-founder John Mackey will be the sole chief executive starting in January, as co-CEO Walter Robb steps down to streamline top management. \u201cWhen business is going great, there aren\u2019t a lot of disagreements, and it can work. But when times get tough, that\u2019s when you start to bump heads,\u201d said Edward Jones grocery analyst Brian Yarbrough. Whole Foods declined to make Messrs. Mackey or Robb available for an interview or to elaborate on how the change will affect the company."]
["Business", "Whole Foods has been fighting a losing battle to get more shoppers in its high-end stores in recent years. The company said Wednesday its comparable sales\u2014a key performance gauge for retailers\u2014have fallen for the past five quarters and aren\u2019t expected to return to growth in the next year. The natural-foods industry has been under fire from traditional competitors like\n            Kroger\n Co.\n      and Target Corp. stocking more organic food at lower prices and other factors such as online grocery ordering and tighter pocketbooks among consumers. \nSprouts Farmers Market\n Inc.,\n      which bills itself as a more value-oriented fresh and organic-foods chain, said Thursday its profit took a hit in the latest quarter as it offered more promotions to drum up business. Its shares fell 11.3% Thursday. Target, too, is still struggling to get its footing in grocery. On Wednesday, it said its grocery chief is leaving the company amid lackluster performance in her division. At Whole Foods, Mr. Robb has championed a plan of offering more promotions and discounts to attract value-seeking shoppers. It has yet to pay off, and some analysts say it could take much steeper discounts and several years to boost sales. \u201cWalter has been the day-to-day operations person, and clearly the day-to-day is not going well,\u201d said Barclays analyst Karen Short,  saying the management shake-up could be a first step in addressing broader strategy issues. Whole Foods was one of the few companies with a dual-leadership structure."]
["Business", "Mr. Robb, who will remain on the board of directors and as a senior adviser, said in an interview earlier this year with The Wall Street Journal: \u201cI have the background of being president and chief operating officer. John is really brilliant at thinking 10 years down the road. I\u2019ve got a lot of passion around the experience for our customers. John\u2019s got a lot of passion around healthy eating.\u201d Decisions by Mr. Mackey, a self-proclaimed foodie and environmentalist, will likely be watched closely in coming months. Jim Hertel,  a grocery-store consultant at Willard Bishop,  said: \u201cWill [Mr. Mackey] just go back to the basics from when Whole Foods was doing well? Because if so, he\u2019d be going back to a time that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. The competitive landscape has changed.\u201d Whole Foods initially created the dual-CEO structure in 2010 for Mr. Robb\u2014a longtime friend of Mr. Mackey and a leader at Whole Foods since 1991. Mr. Mackey didn\u2019t want to leave, and Mr. Robb wanted to be a CEO. \u201cWe went for a walk and figured it out,\u201d Mr. Robb said in the interview earlier this year. Before Mr. Robb stepped into the co-CEO position, Mr. Mackey faced heat for his political banter and for trash-talking a rival store anonymously on online message boards. He is still known for being somewhat of a wild card, industry observers say."]
["Business", "On Wednesday\u2019s call to discuss earnings, Mr. Mackey compared competition in the grocery industry to the Civil War. Ulysses S. Grant, leading the Union Army, was always hearing from his generals about what Robert E.

Two of the other store formats Amazon is considering are bigger than the convenience-style Go store, according to people familiar with the matter. In November, Amazon\u2019s technology team approved a proposal to open large, multifunction stores with curbside pickup capability, clearing the way to start hiring and planning, according to one of the people. "]
["Technology", "Two drive-through prototype locations, which don\u2019t offer an in-store shopping option, are also slated to open within the next few weeks in Seattle, the people said. Amazon envisions opening more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its name, depending on the success of the new test locations, according to the people. By comparison,\n            Kroger\n Co.\n      operates about 2,800 locations across 35 states. Adding grocery pickups will be \u201cpart of their secret sauce in terms of all of the different ways in which they can engage the customer in bringing the product to them,\u201d says Bill Bishop, chief architect at grocery and retail consultancy Brick Meets Click. \u201cEveryone is looking at grocery because of frequency. Frequency guarantees that you have density.\u201d The developments are the next step in Project Como, Amazon\u2019s plan to capture more food sales, opening the door to a key driver of consumer spending that would broaden the online retailer\u2019s increasing dominance in the retail market.  It will also help Amazon better compete against rivals such as\n            Target\n Corp.\n      and\n            Wal-Mart Stores\n Inc.,\n      which plans to expand a service that lets shoppers order online and pickup curbside to 1,000 stores by the end of next year."]
["Technology", "An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.  Until now, Amazon has centered its grocery strategy around Amazon Fresh, a subscription service that promises quick food delivery for online orders. But delivering groceries is logistically complex, requiring fast delivery for cold items as part of large orders on less profitable routes, where stops are spread far apart. And many consumers still prefer to touch, smell and pick out fresh items like fruits and vegetables for themselves.  Online purchases comprise about 1% of the $674 billion market for edible groceries in the U.S., according to Kantar Retail. The Amazon Go store, at roughly 1,800 square feet in downtown Seattle, resembles a convenience store-format in a video Amazon released Monday. It features artificial intelligence-powered technology that eliminates checkouts, cash registers and lines. Instead, customers scan their phone on a kiosk as they walk in, and Amazon automatically determines what items customers take from the shelves. After leaving the store, Amazon charges their account for the items and sends a receipt. Meanwhile, in the suburban Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, a handful of workers on Monday were finishing up one of Amazon\u2019s two drive-through prototypes in the area, which according to the people close to the situation are slated to open in the next few weeks. The wood-paneled building with green trim and an overhang appeared to have at least three covered bays for cars to pull up and pick up orders, with a paved driveway in front."]
["Technology", "The third concept, the newly approved multi-format store, combines in-store shopping with curbside pickups, according to the people. It will likely adopt a 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot floor plans and spartan stocking style like European discount grocery chains Aldi or Lidl, offering a limited fresh selection in store and more via touch-screen orders for delivery later. Stores in this format, which are smaller than traditional U.S. grocery stores, could start appearing late next year. Amazon is pushing further into the grocery business with plans to open convenience stores with curbside delivery. WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens explains on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: Reuters That concept bears strong resemblance to a 2013 report by former Deloitte consultant Brittain Ladd, who now works for Amazon Fresh. The paper, previously reported by GeekWire, describes stores focusing on a core 20% of foods\u2014eggs, dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables and bread\u2014that generate 80% of traditional grocery sales, with drive-through and touch-screen ordering options.  Amazon declined to make Mr. Ladd or other Amazon executives available for comment. While Amazon is moving into brick-and-mortar grocery shopping, other large retailers are expanding their online services. Wal-Mart\u2019s curbside pickup service offers some convenience without the cost of home delivery. Last week Wal-Mart opened its second Pickup and Fuel store in Denver, a small-format store that offers a limited selection of fresh food, snack and gas as well as allowing shoppers to pick up online grocery orders. "]
["Technology", "Target in recent months began considering a pilot to deliver its own groceries, which face declining sales as too few shoppers are buying perishable items like milk and eggs. But it hasn\u2019t moved forward with the idea, according to a person familiar with the matter. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t currently have plans to pursue a full-service, Target-owned grocery delivery service in the near term, we will continue to discuss the idea, among many others, and assess if it is the right fit for the future,\u201d said Target spokeswoman Katie Boylan.  An image supplied by Amazon of its Amazon Go outlet.Photo: Amazon.com Inc. The retailer currently offers a grocery-delivery service in select cities through a partnership with Instacart Inc., a grocery-delivery startup. However, executives are concerned the service is boosting Instacart\u2019s brand rather than the retailer\u2019s own brand, according to the person.  As Target pauses grocery delivery, Amazon envisions filling in the gap. The online retailer hopes to one day function as a grocery-delivery service and distributor for brick-and-mortar retailers, according to one of the people, a move that will help lower its own costs as it builds out its own transportation network. The more deliveries, the more cost-effective its service becomes\u2014including lower food prices as the online retailer purchases more. Analysts say that many retailers would be reluctant to hand over the reins to Amazon.  Grocery sales produce slim profits for chains like Target and Wal-Mart but are important because they drive traffic to their stores where consumers buy higher-margin products like apparel and home items. "]
["Technology", "A future in which Amazon is delivering Target\u2019s groceries is \u201cvery very very unlikely,\u201d said Amy Koo, principal analyst at Kantar Retail. \u201cTarget is not going to give that benefit to Amazon.\u201d  \u2014Jay Greene and Greg Bensinger contributed to this article.

That includes the State Department\u2019s base budget of $25.6 billion and $12 billion in war funding. The $37.6 billion is down $17.3 billion from the 2017 level, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said."]
["Politics and Policy", "The base budget request is $10.1 billion below the 2017 level, or a 28% reduction. \u201cThe level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past\u2014and particularly in this past year\u2014is simply not sustainable,\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in his first news conference in Tokyo on Thursday. The enacted 2016 budget for the State Department and USAID was about $54.6 billion. Mr. Tillerson told reporters the Trump administration aims to prepare for a time in which the U.S. is engaged in fewer military conflicts, and to make foreign assistance programs more effective. \u201cWe are going to be undertaking a very comprehensive examination of how programs are executed, a very comprehensive examination of how we are structured, and I\u2019m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department, we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective, much more efficient, and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. The secretary of state said in a letter to State Department employees that the budget request is \u201can acknowledgment that development needs are a global challenge to be met not just by contributions from the United States, but through greater partnership with and contributions from our allies and others.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s budget request outlines a dramatic shift in the U.S. approach to international organizations, seeking to \u201creduce or end direct funding for international organizations whose missions do not substantially advance U.S. foreign policy interests, are duplicative, or not well-managed,\u201d according to the text released Thursday."]
["Politics and Policy", "The Trump administration is seeking to reduce funding to the U.N. and its affiliated agencies, but the request doesn\u2019t say by how much. Mr. Trump also directed the State Department and USAID to reorganize and consolidate. Under the proposal, the U.S. won\u2019t contribute more than 25% of the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping costs. The U.S. would stop funding U.N. climate change programs under the plan. President Trump's proposed 2018 budget calls for sharp cuts to the State Department and to USAID, which provides humanitarian and economic aid to other countries. WSJ breaks down how much the U.S. spends on foreign aid and where those funds go. Photo: Getty The budget outline also includes $2.2 billion for new embassy construction and $3.1 billion in assistance to Israel, which maintains the Obama administration\u2019s commitments. But Mr. Toner said that the U.S. would be reassessing assistance to other partners, while keeping treaty obligations in mind. The Trump administration also suggests reducing many of the State Department\u2019s educational and cultural-exchange programs, but will aim to sustain the Fulbright Program. It will also reduce U.S. funding to the World Bank by $650 million over three years.  The proposed cuts are included in a 2018 budget blueprint released Thursday by the White House. The blueprint also includes steep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health, and the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts and other independent agencies long in the crosshairs of some conservative Republicans."]
["Politics and Policy", "The suggested reductions come as Mr. Trump looks for ways to offset what he has said will be a significant increase in funding for the military, coming after years of budget caps that first took effect in 2013. Administration officials have said Mr. Trump wants to boost military spending by $54 billion, or 10% over budget caps in place for 2018, although compared with current spending it translates to a 2% increase. \u201cThere is no question this is a hard power budget,\u201d White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters Wednesday, referring to the administration\u2019s preference for military spending over foreign aid. \u201cIt is not a soft power budget, it is a hard power budget. And that was done intentionally.\u201d  Lawmakers from both parties have already criticized the administration\u2019s intent to slash funding for the State Department, warning that its diplomatic mission often furthers national security goals in tandem with the Pentagon. Several repeated their concerns again on Thursday, including Rep. Ed Royce (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cI am very concerned that deep cuts to our diplomacy will hurt efforts to combat terrorism, distribute critical humanitarian aid and promote opportunities for American workers,\u201d Mr. Royce said, adding that he was also concerned that the budget didn\u2019t commit to aid for allies like Jordan. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for the State Department might not make it through Congress."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cWhile the administration proposes a budget, ultimately it is the role of Congress to dispose it and fund government,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we can strike an appropriate balance that recognizes the critical role of diplomacy in keeping our military out of harm\u2019s way and appropriately advancing our nation\u2019s interests while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used in the most efficient and effective manner.\u201d Public health donors and organizations\u200bsharply criticized foreign aid funding cuts proposed in the president\u2019s budget blueprint, arguing they could ultimately undercut national security objectives. \u201cThe notion that security really just boils down to the Department of Defense and people with guns\u2014the world is much more complex than that, our national security interests for the United States are much more complex than that,\u201d said Rob Nabors, the Gates Foundation\u2019s director of U.S. policy, advocacy & communications.\u200b \u2014Betsy McKay contributed to this article.

After all, they\u2019ll figure, they aren\u2019t investing in bitcoin, so if there is a bubble, and it does burst, they\u2019ll be just fine. Well, maybe they should start worrying.

After all, they\u2019ll figure, they aren\u2019t investing in bitcoin, so if there is a bubble, and it does burst, they\u2019ll be just fine. Well, maybe they should start worrying. The market for cryptocurrencies\u2014digital tokens used to transfer money between individuals\u2019 computers with minimal fees\u2014has grown in stature in recent years and is increasingly entwined with broader financial markets as well, a trend that is likely to continue. Bitcoin is now traded by some of the institutional investors around which bond and stock markets revolve. The Wall Street Journal has reported that\n            Goldman Sachs Group\n Inc.\n      is considering opening bitcoin-trading operations. Cryptocurrencies also are being used to raise capital by more companies."]
["Journal Reports: Funds & ETFs", "As the bubble grows, analysts say, a crash has a greater chance of affecting investor sentiment about stocks, especially in the technology and financial sectors. \u201cAny product that blows up, there\u2019s always collateral damage,\u201d says Joe Kinahan,  chief market strategist at brokerage\n            TD Ameritrade\n.\n      Tech and financial \u201ccompanies who are relying on it for business, and those who have put a significant investment into the [blockchain] infrastructure would be the first\u201d to suffer collateral damage, Mr. Kinahan says. What has some market observers concerned is that in less than six months, bitcoin went from around $1,000 a token to $5,000. It is back now to $4,400. But in early 2016, bitcoin was trading at less than $400, bringing its 18-month gain to 1,000%. Consider that the math-based currency has yet to find a widespread use outside of speculation, and warnings of an implosion from\n            J.P. Morgan Chase\n            \n      Chief Executive James Dimon and others in the financial establishment sound like more than curmudgeonry."]
["Journal Reports: Funds & ETFs", "At around $150 billion, the market capitalization of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is up by a factor of roughly eight this year, according to the Cointelegraph website. If this growth rate continues, what\u2019s now a relatively small part of global investible assets could become a significant one, says Lorenzo Di Mattia,  manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund and a student of the history of speculation. By next year, Mr. Di Mattia expects the bubble to have inflated to the point where a pop could send a shock wave through the stock market. Bitcoin pioneered the cryptocurrency movement, but after eight years, the virtual currency is still struggling to find mainstream acceptance. Author and WSJ Moneybeat reporter Paul Vigna joins Lunch Break's Tanya Rivero to discuss why many people talk about bitcoin, but most don't use it. Photo: Bloomberg (Originally published April 12, 2017) Another analyst says bitcoin is at a similar stage in its development as the internet was in 1994, early in the speculative bubble. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is a new technology that people are still trying to understand,\u201d says Matthew Gertler,  senior analyst and counsel at Digital Asset Research, which provides research to institutional investors on cryptocurrency issues. Give bitcoin its due: Most people in finance agree that bitcoin and the blockchain, the open-access ledger that underpins the currency, were great inventions; even as J.P. Morgan\u2019s Mr. Dimon derides bitcoin as a \u201cfraud,\u201d his bank is working on its own blockchain technology."]
["Journal Reports: Funds & ETFs", "The bitcoin invention goes back to a 2008 blueprint signed by Satoshi Nakamoto and circulated on the internet. When a bitcoin owner transfers a token to another person, he or she posts the transaction to the blockchain, a simple account book floating on the internet, signing it with a unique string of numbers and letters. Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d verify the transaction by running those numbers through formulas on high-powered computers, work for which they are paid mostly in newly minted bitcoin. For the users, fees are relatively low and transactions are\u2014in theory\u2014fraud-proof. Clever as it is, however, bitcoin has shown no signs of replacing the dollar and other \u201cfiat\u201d currencies. \u201cFor bitcoin to be a success, it needs to take a large part of various markets\u2014remittances, payments, stored value,\u201d says Mr. Gertler. Meanwhile, speculation in bitcoin\u2014driven by hopes of its wider adoption\u2014actually has diminished its usefulness as a means of exchange. \u201cSay you agree to buy a car [in bitcoin] and the price on Saturday is $32,000 and because of a bitcoin move, on Monday it\u2019s $41,000\u2014people just can\u2019t live their lives like that,\u201d says Mr. Kinahan of TD Ameritrade. A crash in the price of leading cryptocurrencies would almost certainly hurt shares of\n            Nvidia\n Corp.\n      , the chip maker that was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 in 2016, and its rival\n            Advanced Micro Devices\n Inc.,\n      at least temporarily. Both companies have noted in their quarterly filings that cryptocurrency miners are a key source of demand for their graphic chips. Sales of chips to cryptocurrency sources represented 6.7% of Nvidia\u2019s fiscal second-quarter revenue of $2.23 billion."]
["Journal Reports: Funds & ETFs", "\u201cAnybody getting more than 5% of their business from crypto, it\u2019s starting to become significant and you could see their stock prices very quickly collapse\u201d in the event of a bubble bursting, says Mr. Kinahan. Spokesmen for Nvidia and AMD declined to comment for this article. Other companies at risk include those in financial technology, or \u201cfintech,\u201d one of the hottest parts of the tech sector. Shares of the exchange-traded fund\n        Global X FinTech\n      (FINX), a basket of such stocks, are up 43% in 2017. \u201cA lot of the innovation around financial tech has to do with blockchain these days,\u201d says Gil Luria,  director of institutional equity research at brokerage DA Davidson. \u201cSo if the crypto asset values decline and that\u2019s associated with the blockchain innovations, there could be some carry-over effect.\u201d That possibility has some observers worried about the broader tech sector, as well, where investors are already uneasy about elevated valuations. Another concern is the use of cryptocurrencies by some startups as a funding mechanism. Companies such as teen-oriented chat application Kik Interactive are using bitcoin-like systems to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from crowdsourced investors overnight, skirting initial-public-offering regulations and avoiding tough questions from venture capitalists. In many ICOs, or initial coin offerings, companies don\u2019t have a product yet when they sell these stakes, says Mr. Gertler."]
["Journal Reports: Funds & ETFs", "Shares of the online retailer\n            Overstock.com\n            \n      shot up recently after it said it was exploring a trading platform for ICOs. \u201cTo the extent there\u2019s any negative changes [in the value of cryptocurrencies], that could be to their detriment,\u201d Mr. Luria says. Fears about fraudulent ICOs, meanwhile, caused Chinese regulators to shut down local bitcoin exchanges recently, causing a 20% retreat in bitcoin prices. In 18 months, however, a new bitcoin crash could have wider ramifications. That is when Spencer Bogart,  head of research with cryptocurrency investment firm Blockchain Capital, estimates that the first bitcoin ETF will reach the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a high-profile ETF proposal from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss earlier this year, citing the lack of regulation and transparency on underlying bitcoin exchanges. But LedgerX LLC recently received Commodity Futures Trading Commission permission to trade and clear bitcoin options and futures. ETF firm ProShares filed an application for long and short funds that would track bitcoin futures on the\n            Chicago Board Options Exchange\n,\n      which has said it would apply for approval of these derivatives. The appearance of an ETF would result in another surge in speculative activity as small investors wary of the high-tech bitcoin markets and institutional investors obliged to trade only registered securities finally have a way in, say Mr. Bogart and others."]

There\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for such a product.\u201d One sign of that demand is the wild behavior of the closest thing to an ETF on the market, the over-the-counter-traded\n            Bitcoin Investment Trust\n.\n      Owing to the trust\u2019s design, where shares must be owned by wealthy investors for a year before they can sell, there is a limited supply. This shortage became acute when fund manager Grayscale Investments LLC suspended creation of new shares in January while it sought SEC approval for an exchange listing (it abandoned that particular effort in late September). For about four months, the fund traded at nearly a 100% premium to its bitcoin holdings. Usually spreads between ETFs and the underlying indexes are measured in fractions of percentage points. Currently, bitcoin markets have very limited links to stocks, bonds and commodities, allowing for some quarantine. An ETF would allow for the kind of \u201ccontagion\u201d\u2014the forced selling of seemingly unrelated assets\u2014that bring on financial crises."]

["Technology", "The strategy worked. A little more than a year since launch, EA says users play an average 2.5 hours a day, putting \u201cGalaxy of Heroes\u201d among its most popular mobile games. It ranks among the top 25 revenue-generating apps on the\n            Apple\n Inc.\n      and\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\n      U.S. app stores. Daily rewards have emerged as the indispensable tool for hooking players in a field of more than a million game apps. The stakes are high: Mobile games are on track this year to become the biggest slice of the nearly $100 billion videogame industry. Extracting as much time as possible out of users is critical because games like \u201cGalaxy of Heroes\u201d make money selling virtual goods. The more people play, the more likely they will spend. Companies have myriad ways to encourage routine use, such as a monthly calendar that tracks a player\u2019s progress or weeklong side missions with extra-valuable rewards. The latest mobile-game hit, \u201cSuper Mario Run,\u201d rewards players for competing daily against friends. Ingraining a game into a person\u2019s daily routine is key, since that increases the chances a player will become a coveted spender, said Dr. Rachel Kowert,  a research psychologist in Austin, Texas. \u201cPeople are genuinely goal-driven and games are just providing goals to achieve,\u201d she said."]
["Technology", "Developers began experimenting with daily rewards around 2012, when mobile games evolved from mostly paid to free. The tool is gaining traction as the cost to acquire a new user grows\u2014it cost an average of $6.62 in the U.S. last year across about a half dozen major advertising platforms, compared with $3.87 in 2015 and $1.98 in 2014, according to a mobile-marketing firm Fiksu DSP. This year, 18 out of the top 25 most downloaded games in the U.S. offer some form of daily-reward system, up from 11 in 2014, according to Sensor Tower Inc. King added a calendar of daily logins this year to \u201cCandy Crush Saga,\u201d a well-established but aging puzzle franchise. The feature has proved particularly popular, said Sebastian Knutsson,  creative chief at the\n            Activision Blizzard\n Inc.\n      unit. A screenshot showing rewards offered by \u2018Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.\u2019Photo: EA At its peak in late July, the smash hit \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d generated $88 million in weekly revenue. That fell to about $24 million by the first week of November, according to Sensor Tower. To reignite interest, the game\u2019s developer Niantic Inc. added daily bonuses that increase in value when players consistently open the app to catch monsters and visit Pok\u00e9 Stops. A limited-time event pegged to Halloween boosted engagement. Daily-reward initiatives aren\u2019t foolproof, though. One mistake is giving away so much players don\u2019t need to spend. Another is punishing players for taking breaks."]
["Technology", "Sebastien Benedict, a 31-year-old nonprofit worker in Ottawa, Canada, was close to earning a large sum of virtual currency in a game with daily check-ins. He missed a day when he traveled for a business trip, and his login streak was set to zero. That was his breaking point. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to start from scratch just because you\u2019re not able to play a game every day,\u201d said Mr. Benedict. Now he plays Activision Blizzard\u2019s \u201cHearthstone\u201d almost daily since the card game lets him skip logging in up to two days in a row without penalty. He spends between $25 and $50 a month in it on virtual card packs, he said.

Not knowing what to expect excites people, said Michael Hanus,  a professor at the University Nebraska who researched gamification and rewards. Exclusive offers, such as the opportunity to unlock a rare character during a one-week event, tap into people\u2019s natural fear of missing out, he said. Game companies are cautious, though, not to tax players with too many chores. \u201cGalaxy of Heroes\u201d introduced several new tasks in the past year, including letting players train and fight with starships."]

["Business", "\u201cThe ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Berkshire Chairman and Chief Executive Warren Buffett said in a statement. The companies, he said, believe \u201cputting our collective resources behind the country\u2019s best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.\u201d Plans are still evolving and nothing has been decided beyond forming a company and moving ahead, according to people with knowledge of the matter. At one stage, there was discussion among some people about taking over administration of employees\u2019 pharmacy benefits and health-insurance benefits from the companies\u2019 current insurers and PBMs, according to a document from December viewed by The Wall Street Journal. But the document was an initial proposal and that idea isn\u2019t currently on the table, the people said. The December document also took aim at some of the industry\u2019s middlemen, saying that past efforts to address health-costs didn\u2019t work \u201cbecause they conceded the existence and role of intermediaries (PBMs, insurance administrators, wholesale distributors and pharmacies) which have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.\u201d One person with knowledge of the matter said the focus now is on helping the current vendors work better, not replacing them. Even with little detail available, the plan\u2019s potential threat to existing industries spooked investors and sent shares of insurers and PBMs lower Tuesday.\u00a0Amazon had earlier triggered concerns in the health-care industry, with its ambitions a factor last year in\n            CVS Health\u00a0Corp\n.\n      \u2019s\u00a0$69 billion\u00a0bid for insurance giant\n            Aetna\u00a0Inc\n.\n"]
["Business", "Amazon has been eyeing an entry into the pharmacy-services industry and has added health-care supply options to its business-to-business marketplace offering. Together, Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have more than one million employees, though not all of them in the U.S. The initiative is \u201cundefined, but the resources of the three companies are enormous,\u201d said\u00a0Matthew\u00a0Borsch, an analyst with\u00a0BMO\u00a0Capital Markets. Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Mr. Buffett, JPMorgan CEO\u00a0James Dimon and Amazon Chief Jeff Bezos have known one another for years and have been talking about this idea formally and informally, according to people familiar with the matter. The plan came together in the past several months under the code name Project Lincoln, according to the December document and one of the people familiar with the matter.\u00a0  Todd Combs,  an investment officer at Berkshire and a JPMorgan board member; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold,  a managing director of\u00a0JPMorgan;\u00a0and Beth Galetti,  a senior vice president at Amazon, are overseeing the entity\u2019s formation. Mr. Combs, who joined the JPMorgan board in 2016, was influential in connecting the companies and formalizing the plans, some of the people said. Berkshire owns auto insurer Geico and a slew of other property-and-casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. "]
["Business", "The CEOs decided to go public with the plans before the concept was fully fleshed out, the people familiar with it said, to start hiring and bring in new ideas and expertise.  The company aims to have a CEO in place by the end of 2018, according to the December document and a person with knowledge of the matter. One aim is for the initiative to create a health-care data warehouse. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars and, if successful, could be a blueprint for others, the person said. Over the longer term, according to the December document and the person with knowledge of the matter, the effort could tackle crafting new types of agreements with health-care providers, such as flat fees for episodes of care, and using technology to provide more tracking and care outside traditional health-care settings such as hospitals. The new company will likely prod health-care providers to employ digital health tools that enable them to share data with other providers and with patients.  Amazon\u00a0and JPMorgan on Tuesday sent emails to employees saying nothing is immediately changing for their health-care offerings, according to internal memos reviewed by The Wall Street Journal."]

The rising cost of health care is a growing burden on payers, including employers, which are the biggest source of insurance coverage for Americans.

["Business", "Other companies have banded together in an effort to change health care, most notably some 40 big employers called the Health Transformation Alliance.Employers generally complain about the steadily rising cost of health care, along with growing indications of waste, sometimes-unnecessary procedures and rising prices for some types of care and prescription drugs. The annual cost of an employer health plan for a family hit\u00a0$18,764 last year, according to an annual poll of employers performed by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. The fractured nature of the U.S. health-care system makes it difficult for even the most significant companies to implement large-scale change. Often, they have large groups of employees in only a few health-care markets, limiting their ability to prod local providers to change their ways.  \u201cHealth care is so local,\u201d said Craig Dolezal,  a senior vice president at Aon PLC. \u201cSolving health care in America means solving health care in Dallas, and Phoenix, and New York\u2026.It\u2019s a big challenge to change the entrenched stakeholders and systems that are in place.\u201d \u2014Nicole Friedman and Cara Lombardo contributed to this article.

["China News", "Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201cThought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d seemingly covers all decision-making and mentions critical challenges to China\u2019s continued development. Mr. Xi devoted a large portion of Wednesday\u2019s speech to explaining the rubric.

Mr. Xi\u2019s new slogan echoes \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d which was formulated in the 1980s during Deng\u2019s rule and provided an ideological footing for the Communist Party\u2019s embrace of market remedies to reboot China\u2019s economy. At the time, party leaders declared that China would need a hundred years, starting from the Communist victory in 1949, to achieve \u201csocialist modernization.\u201d Mr. Xi, in his speech, brought that deadline forward to 2035.

When his supporters successfully campaigned for its inclusion in the party charter, Marxist scholars in influential think tanks wrote critical analyses questioning the move. If President Xi\u2019s name is added to the party charter, many in the party will be watching to see whether his theory is publicized and cast in a way that harks back to Mao, some analysts said. Such a step, they said, would reinforce worries that Mr. Xi plans to become a dictator and do away with the collective-leadership system in place for four decades. His current colleagues in the leadership, the foreign minister and other senior officials are publicly cheering him on, giving the campaign for a Xi theory the air of inevitability.

["World News", "JBS said it has halted beef production for three days in 33 of its 36 Brazilian plants. Next week, it will cut production by 35% of capacity at all its units. \u201cThe measures aim at adjusting production until there is a decision about the embargoes imposed by importers,\u201d JBS said in a statement. The government is rushing to convince buyers sanitation oversight is sound and the meat is good.  President Michel Temer said he was calling leaders in China, the biggest buyer of Brazilian meat, on Thursday to discuss the issue.  China, 20 other countries and the European Union have issued temporary bans or increased scrutiny on Brazilian meat shipments. The EU, Canada and other markets suspended imports from just a few Brazilian suppliers. The actions, however, knocked down the country\u2019s animal protein exports to $74,000 on Tuesday, according to the latest data available, from a previous daily average of $63 million. \u201cFor the industry, this is a disaster,\u201d said Carlos Kawall,  chief economist at Banco Safra in S\u00e3o Paulo and a former head of Brazil\u2019s Treasury.

JBS and BRF declined to comment. The drop in exports, though harmful for the industry, is unlikely to do much harm to the whole economy, said Silvio Campos Neto,  an economist at Tend\u00eancias consulting firm. The loss would amount to roughly $1 billion a month, he said, a small sum compared with the $203 billion in overall Brazilian exports this year, as per his firm\u2019s forecast. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to be a short-term impact [that] wouldn\u2019t make much difference,\u201d he said. Even though 80% of Brazil\u2019s meat production is consumed domestically, the decline in exports could lead to a glut in the local market, which could weaken consumer prices, Mr. Campos Neto said, in a potential silver lining for meat-loving Brazilians. But that could hardly help meatpackers. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d said Pedro Galdi,  from Upside Investors consulting firm. \u201cMeatpackers reduced slaughtering, prices are going to fall, importers will be more demanding,\u201d he said.

Two of the nation\u2019s most prominent bankers on Tuesday hinted at higher dividends in the future, especially if bank stocks keep rising.

Morgan Chase\n            \n      Chief Executive James Dimon said that, at a certain price, buying back the firm\u2019s shares may no longer be the best use of excess capital. Paying out more dividends, perhaps in the form of one-time special dividends, could start to make more sense, he said."]
["Heard on the Street", "Mr. Dimon didn\u2019t specify where the threshold is exactly, but indicated he looks at the ratio of price to tangible book value.\u00a0J.P. Morgan\u2019s price to tangible book ratio now stands at 1.65, according to FactSet, compared with 1.27 at the end of June. \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nBank of America\n            \n      Chief Executive Brian Moynihan,  speaking after Mr. Dimon at the same conference, also said special dividends might make more sense than buybacks at some point. But he indicated Bank of America\u2019s own share price isn\u2019t there yet, characterizing it as still cheap. Its shares are currently at 1.3 times tangible book, compared with 0.82 times at the end of June. Investors generally prefer regular dividends to buybacks because they provide a steady income stream that payers are often hesitant to reduce during downturns. This, however, is also why policy makers have favored buybacks in postcrisis regulation of capital management by banks. Reluctance to cut dividends can leave banks with lower capital cushions heading to a crisis. But as Mr. Dimon noted Tuesday, there are now signs that this attitude may be shifting. In a September speech, Federal Reserve Gov. Daniel Tarullo said the Fed\u2019s \u201csoft limit\u201d on dividend-payout ratios, at 30% of profit, could be relaxed somewhat. That, combined with the rally in bank-share prices, makes higher payout ratios likely going forward."]
["Heard on the Street", "This is clearly positive for investors, with one caveat: If banks are suddenly not eager to buy back their own shares, it is an indication of less compelling value.

["Technology", "In an email sent Monday to Expedia employees, Chairman Barry Diller said it appears likely Mr. Khosrowshahi will accept Uber\u2019s offer. Mr. Diller, who is also chief executive of IAC, wrote that \u201che\u2019s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes.\u201d  Representatives for Uber didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Uber\u2019s decision caps a remarkably chaotic leadership search for the world\u2019s most valuable venture-funded startup, one that has been shaken by an internecine war on its board. Benchmark Capital, one of Uber\u2019s biggest and earliest investors, first led the ouster in June of co-founder Mr. Kalanick, then sued him to try to force him off the board. Other investors chose sides, exchanging accusations and counterclaims that remain unresolved. If he accepts the job, Mr. Khosrowshahi, 48 years old, will have the task of repairing Uber\u2019s image after months of scandal at the ride-hailing firm. The company is grappling with the fallout from allegations of sexism and sexual harassment, depleted executive ranks and a lawsuit by Google parent Alphabet Inc. alleging that Uber used design secrets for its self-driving program.  He will also have to contend with a deeply divided board and shareholder base over the future of the company, as well as his predecessor, Mr. Kalanick, who sits on Uber\u2019s board and wishes to have strong input into the company\u2019s direction."]
["Technology", "Mr. Khosrowshahi, an Iranian-American who has run Expedia for more than a decade, stands to potentially make a fortune at Uber if he can steer the company to a successful public offering. It isn\u2019t clear when Uber, valued last year by investors at around $68 billion, may file for an IPO\u2014but it is first working to shore up its finances to appeal to potential investors.  In 2015, Mr. Khosrowshahi was one of the most highly compensated chief executives in the S&P 500, receiving a pay package valued as much as $94.6 million in mostly long-term stock options designed to get him to stay for several years. In Mr. Khosrowshahi, Uber would get a longtime internet executive with deal-making experience and a record of steady growth. He started his career at investment bank Allen & Co., impressing Mr. Diller with his financial acumen. He joined Mr. Diller\u2019s company in 1998, became financial chief of IAC, then called USA Networks, in 2002 and took over the CEO job of Expedia when it was spun off in 2005. In his note Monday, Mr. Diller said Mr. Khosrowshahi was grappling with the decision to join Uber \u201cout of both his abiding enthusiasm for Expedia\u2019s future as well as his loyalty to all of us.\u201d  At Uber, Mr. Khosrowshahi would inherit a 15,000-employee global concern that is still deeply unprofitable. It had losses of more than $3 billion last year and nearly $1.4 billion in this year\u2019s first half. It is still increasing sales, including reporting last week $1.75 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up 17% from the first quarter. Full-year sales last year were $6.5 billion."]
["Technology", "Expedia, by comparison, had sales of $8.77 billion last year, up 31% from the year before, with net income of $281.8 million, which was down by 63% from a year earlier. The choice of Mr. Khosrowshahi was a surprise given other, bigger candidate names that surfaced in the media. Over the weekend, directors met with Ms. Whitman and General Electric Co. Chairman Jeff Immelt for final presentations detailing their visions for the company in the top job. Mr. Immelt removed himself from consideration on Sunday morning after observing disorder and divisions among different factions of Uber\u2019s board, according to a person familiar with the matter. Others said it was a face-saving move after he was advised he would not get the votes necessary to be elected to Uber\u2019s top job. Ms. Whitman\u2019s candidacy was a source of bitter fighting among directors after she stated publicly in July on Twitter and last week in The Wall Street Journal that she wasn\u2019t interested in the position. Some directors felt Ms. Whitman\u2019s re-emergence was being pushed by Benchmark Capital, which has had a close relationship with her since her time as\n            eBay\n Inc.\n      CEO. Benchmark has denied it advocated for Ms. Whitman. The firm earlier this month sued Mr. Kalanick, claiming he knew about misbehavior at the company when he persuaded the venture-capital firm and other shareholders to add three board seats under his control. Mr. Kalanick and Matt Cohler,  a partner at Benchmark, are both on the board and five-member CEO search committee. Mr. Kalanick has said the lawsuit is without merit."]
["Technology", "The lawsuit, and competing claims and accusations among Uber\u2019s biggest shareholders, served as a distraction as the board aimed to complete the CEO search by early September. If Uber ultimately hires Mr. Khosrowshahi, the search will have taken place in about two months, a relatively short period for a company of Uber\u2019s size. Generally it takes three to five months for a company of Uber\u2019s size, recruiters say. But Uber is in great need of a new leader after Mr. Kalanick resigned, leaving the company\u2019s big decisions to an executive committee of more than a dozen people. Mr. Khosrowshahi would need to find new executives in a number of top jobs, including chiefs of finance, marketing and operations. Uber is also looking for a new independent chairman. Before Uber officially announces Mr. Khosrowshahi as CEO, he will still have to negotiate his contract, according to people familiar with the matter. That process can take days or even weeks sometimes, but Uber hopes to fast-track the process to announce the executive to employees this week, one of the people said. Mr. Khosrowshahi sits on the boards of both sports retailer Fanatics Inc. and New York Times Co. Fanatics CEO Doug Mack called Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s appointment as Uber CEO \u201ca coup\u201d in an interview. \u201cHe understands how tech is a catalyst for anything you\u2019re doing in a business. And he\u2019s very attuned to matters of culture.\u201d Uber is desperate need of a culture revamp after its scandal-ridden year and a series of executive departures. "]

Resurgent output from U.S. shale producers has blunted OPEC\u2019s efforts, and prices\u2014after a brief boost\u2014have swung between $48 and $52 a barrel in the past month. Another problem facing OPEC is\u00a0inventories\u00a0in 35 of the world\u2019s most industrialized nations: the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. OPEC said earlier this month that crude stockpiles increased from the fourth quarter of 2016 by 31 million barrels to just over 3 billion\u2014276 million barrels above the five-year average. But Mr. Falih said there has been a significant reduction of inventories in the past few weeks, and compliance has improved from producers participating in the cut deal, including Russia."]
["Markets Main", "\u201cWe believe that continuation with the same level of cuts, plus eventually adding one or two small producers...will be more than adequate to bring the five-year balance to where they need to be by the end of the first quarter 2018,\u201d he said. National representatives from OPEC members said last week that though the relationship with Russia has vastly improved, Saudi and others in the group are set to pressure Moscow to fully comply with its commitment to cut production if, as expected, it agrees to extend the deal later this month. Mr. Falih said that despite Russia taking up to four months to achieve its share of the cut, OPEC now has \u201cfull commitment from the Russian side including President [Vladimir] Putin himself who has made it clear that Russia will continue to deliver their 300,000 barrels-a-day cut.\u201d Cartel members in recent weeks have suggested either making deeper production cuts in case Libya and Nigeria\u2014which aren\u2019t bound by the deal\u2014boost their output, or\u00a0bringing new participants into the effort to cut oil exports, officials said. The functions of production levels from Libya and Nigeria, however, haven\u2019t taken OPEC out of the range decide last year, but the cartel will do whatever is necessary\u00a0to balance the market, the Saudi minister said. \u201cWe are flexible and we will continue to monitor the market and, as well as I said in the beginning, we are all ready to consider other creative suggestions that may emerge between now and May 25,\u201d he added."]

Ms. Nahle, in an interview at her office in Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress, offered few details on how results would be judged."]
["Latin America News", "Investors are wary of a L\u00f3pez Obrador victory primarily because of his opposition to\u00a0Mexico\u2019s recent energy overhaul, which put an end to eight decades of the state\u2019s monopoly in the oil industry. A number of his aides, though, have recently sought to give reassurances that existing contracts will be honored. Mexico has held eight oil auctions in the past three years, awarding 91 exploration and production contracts amounting to an expected investment of $150 billion during the life of the contracts. But the roaring pace could slow dramatically under Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who leads by an average of 7.5 percentage points in five recent polls ahead of the July 1 vote. He has campaigned on a pledge to halt the privatization of state assets.

Ms. Nahle said the contracts already awarded would be reviewed but not canceled, unless some irregularity is found. \u201cInvestors can be calm, we\u2019ll respect the law,\u201d she said. Ms. Nahle also said Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s party would seek to change the law in order to allow a referendum on the 2013 energy overhaul."]
["Latin America News", "An attempt to hold a referendum on the opening of the oil sector was blocked in 2014 by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Mexican law doesn\u2019t allow public consultation on matters affecting government budgets. Even with lower prices and a drop in output over the past decade, oil still contributes around 17% of Mexico\u2019s federal government revenue. A L\u00f3pez Obrador victory could mean more uncertainty for potential investors and less oil investment in Mexico, the world\u2019s 11th-largest crude producer. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto made the energy overhaul the centerpiece of a long-term strategy to turn around Mexico\u2019s declining crude production. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, on the other hand, has focused on calls to strengthen state oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos and shift from a model based on exporting crude oil to one where the government has an active role producing gasoline and more expensive oil products. He has said he wants to build two refineries. \u201cWe must abandon this lazy mentality that says that we can\u2019t produce here,\u201d Ms. Nahle said in her modest office decorated with portraits of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and former Presidents Benito Ju\u00e1rez and L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, who expropriated the oil industry in 1938. Ms. Nahle left the door open to new oil auctions under a L\u00f3pez Obrador administration if the recent ones show positive results, but she was skeptical. \u201cI doubt there will be good results,\u201d Ms. Nahle said, adding that companies often inflate their operating costs to diminish the government\u2019s share of profits.

It led the U.S. responses to the Zika epidemic in the Americas last year, as well as the 2014 Ebola in West Africa, where the agency is still involved. It is also at the forefront of public health battles against more antibiotic-resistant infections, food-borne outbreaks, and the obesity epidemic."]

["Business", "In most cases, these announcements reflect expansion and spending plans that predated Election Day or boil down to relatively small increases at huge companies. For example,\n            Wal-Mart Stores\n Inc.\u2019s\nrecent pledge to create 10,000 jobs this year amounts to 0.7% of its current U.S. workforce. \u201cSome of these jobs were going to be announced anyway, but are being announced in a way that is much more public, perhaps to garner a little bit of political favor\u2014or perhaps more importantly, to stay out of trouble,\u201d said Jim Russell, a portfolio manager with Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati, which has about $17 billion under management. Amazon and most other companies mentioned in this article declined to comment beyond their public statements or didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comment. Overall, the announced jobs and investment tallied by the Journal\u2014even if all of them were entirely new\u2014would have a small impact on the U.S. economy. The country typically creates some 5 million jobs in any given month, economists say\u2014offset by nearly as many jobs that are eliminated, with the difference working out to a net gain of about 180,000 a month in recent years. \u201cWhen you have almost 200 million workers in the U.S., you cannot move the needle cutting deals for 800 jobs,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist. \u201cIf Trump can make one deal a day, it would take him 20 years to create as many jobs as the U.S. economy does in one month. It makes great media but poor government.\u201d"]
["Business", "The Trump transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In an interview with the Journal last week, Mr. Trump said he wasn\u2019t micromanaging business decisions. \u201cI\u2019m setting a tone for hundreds of companies,\u201d he said.  Regardless of how many of the jobs were already in the works, Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on creating American jobs and his willingness to inject himself into business decisions have forced many companies to rethink how they plan and present their growth strategies.  Most firms are hiring because of improving economic conditions, but \u201cit\u2019s happily coincidental with a political agenda that is a 110% pro-American, pro-jobs kind of message,\u201d Mr. Russell said. For example,\n            Ford Motor\n Co.\n      executives attributed their decision to cancel a $1.6 billion investment in a Mexico plant and add 700 new U.S. jobs to shifts in the auto market as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cThis is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing,\u201d Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said this month.  The biggest announcement in recent weeks came from Amazon, which said last week it would add 100,000 full-time U.S. jobs over the next 18 months. It said many of the roles would be in warehouses that had been previously announced and were already under construction. "]
["Business", "Such expansion is significant for a company that currently has about 180,000 full-time workers in the U.S. Still, the promised growth\u2014representing a roughly 37% increase in U.S. full-time workers in the first year\u2014is about in line with Amazon\u2019s recent hiring trends globally. In 2015, for example, Amazon added about 76,700 full-time and part-time jobs world-wide, an increase in total employment of 50% over 2014. An Amazon spokesman declined to provide annual U.S. employment figures, except to note the company employed 30,000 people in the U.S. in 2011. In other cases, investment and hiring plans were in place, at least in part, before Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory.\n            Hyundai Motor\n Co.\u2019s\n      $3.1 billion expansion of U.S. production capacity, for example, had been decided before Election Day, President Chung Jin-haeng said when announcing the plans this week. \nLockheed Martin\n Corp.\n      Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson promised after a meeting with Mr. Trump last week to add 1,800 jobs at its main F-35 combat jet assembly facility in Fort Worth, Texas, adding to the 8,800 already working there, once a pending contract for 90 more jets is signed. However, the company had said in 2015 that it expected to add about 1,000 jobs there as it boosted production. Lockheed employs 98,000 world-wide, nearly all in the U.S."]
["Business", "Similarly,\n            General Motors\n Co.\n      said Tuesday it would create 450 U.S. jobs by bringing in-house the assembly of pickup-truck axles now made in Mexico by\n            American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings\n Inc.\n      But the decision dates back at least 18 months, based on comments from American Axle executives during conference calls. GM also said it would create or retain about 1,500 U.S. manufacturing jobs with $1 billion of spending on its operations.  On Tuesday, Wal-Mart said the 10,000 jobs it plans to add would come from existing efforts to open, remodel or relocate stores as well as to expand its e-commerce operations. It was a repackaging of an investment strategy the company had laid out to investors in October. Mr. Trump responded that day, tweeting \u201cThank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!\u201d At both Wal-Mart and GM, the new jobs are offset by recent and planned job cuts. Wal-Mart eliminated around 17,000 positions last year when it closed over 100 U.S. stores and cut some back-office positions. It plans to cut about 1,000 corporate jobs this month. After the election, General Motors said it would lay off around 3,300 workers across three plants in Michigan and Ohio in the first quarter. GM said it expects some of those who are laid off will find jobs at other GM plants under provisions of the company\u2019s union contract."]
["Business", "After meeting with Mr. Trump in December, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs at other companies. Later that day, Mr. Son told the Journal the investment would come from a $100 billion fund he began setting up earlier last year. Given that the fund is targeting investments in startups and technology companies, half of that money would likely have come to the U.S. regardless, analysts say. It would also be difficult to create 50,000 jobs entirely by investing in startups, which generally employ few workers. The decision to steer about half the funding to established but fast-growing U.S. companies was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory stance, according to a person familiar with Mr. Son\u2019s thinking. Other hiring figures are harder to pin down.\n            Alibaba Group Holding\n Ltd.\n      founder Jack Ma met with Mr. Trump on Jan. 9 and said his Chinese e-commerce company would help create 1 million U.S. jobs in five years; but that was based on a projection of the impact of more Americans selling products on the company\u2019s websites, rather than any pledge that Alibaba will hire itself.

["Markets Main", "The Saudis want OPEC, Russia and other big producers to keep withholding about 2% of global oil production for all of 2018, said people familiar with the matter. An agreement first struck a year ago and set to expire in March is aimed at reducing a global oversupply of oil caused in part by U.S. producers. Russia isn\u2019t a member of OPEC but has emerged as an oil-and-politics power broker in the past year. Moscow is pushing for a shorter agreement that could be changed if oil prices continue to rise and allow American shale producers to ramp up output, the people said. Russian oil companies have chafed under production limitations in the past year and want to cash in on higher prices before a flood of oil from the U.S. crashes the market again.  \u201cThere are differences over the amount of time we need,\u201d Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said to reporters in Dubai on Tuesday.  A potential compromise emerged on Wednesday in private talks at OPEC headquarters, according to people familiar with the matter. OPEC, Russia and others would agree to extend their current agreement for nine months\u2014from March through December\u2014but it would be reviewed after three months at OPEC\u2019s next meeting in June, the people said. \u201cThis way Saudi Arabia gets a win of nine months, and Russia can tell its oil companies they are only committed for another 3 months of cuts,\u201d said Joe McMonigle, energy-policy analyst at Hedgeye, an independent investment research firm in Connecticut.

["Markets Main", "Oil prices, which had risen following the release Wednesday of U.S. data showing a decline in crude inventories, fell by around 1% following reports about the potential compromise. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down at $62.55 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate futures were at $57.41 a barrel in afternoon trading.  Such a compromise deal would be \u201cnegative for prices because the market is expecting an unconditional nine-month extension,\u201d said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Wealth Management. The differences between Russia and Saudi Arabia are among the final hurdles for big oil producers to overcome as they gather here Thursday. Mr. Falih and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak,  didn\u2019t hint at the discord in public appearances. They both suggested that there is still more work to be done after the agreement expires in March.  \u201cMarkets have yet to be rebalanced,\u201d Mr. Novak said following the preliminary OPEC meeting.  OPEC, which controls about 40% of global oil production, has sought to reassert its relevance following an oil-price crash it could do nothing to halt. The Saudi-Russian alliance has helped, though there is debate about how much the production cuts have contributed to rising prices compared with a strong global economy and healthy oil demand. Once Cold War enemies, Russia and Saudi Arabia have used oil to underpin their new relationship. Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to prop up energy revenues that make up a third of his government\u2019s budget. Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t want to cut production without Moscow\u2019s participation, for fear that Russia would swoop in on the kingdom\u2019s markets."]

BHP, which has faced headwinds from a fatal tailings-dam disaster at one of its mining operations in Brazil, is up 62%. \nRio Tinto\n          \n      PLC, which is focusing more on its copper business, offered a preview of how miners\u2019 fortunes have flipped to the upside when it reported earnings earlier this month. The Anglo-Australian mining giant said it returned to a profit in 2016 with $4.62 billion in earnings, increased its dividend and announced a $500 million share buyback. Overall, the miners\u2019 results are expected to highlight a head-snapping turnaround in the past 12 months that has seen the industry pull back from the precipice of financial disaster. \u201cThe past year has brought some reprieve,\u201d said Anglo Chief Executive Mark Cutifani in a speech this month in South Africa. \u201cWhile market watchers were ready to sound a death knell on mining\u2019s prospects, we are still here, stronger than we were before.\u201d A year ago, miners were haunted by hair-raising worst-case scenarios in commodities as growth in China stalled, investors panicked and prices fell to what Barclays called their lowest levels in 30 years."]
["Business", " Anglo said it would cut its workforce in half. Glencore frantically raised $4.7 billion from asset sales to trim its debt. Investors told Glencore executives they worried copper could dip below $4,000 a metric ton, threatening the stability of the miner\u2019s debt-laden balance sheet. But while copper flirted with the $4,000 level, it never breached it. On Friday, copper prices were over $6,000 a metric ton. The metal\u2019s resurgence partially has been driven by a government economic stimulus program in China, where over 40% of the world\u2019s copper is consumed. Anglo American Chief Executive Mark Cutifani at the United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva on Nov. 15, 2016. Photo: Michele Limina/Bloomberg News At the same time, supply has come off the market. This year, there have been snags at two of the world\u2019s largest copper mines\u2014labor problems at Chile\u2019s Minera Escondida, jointly owned by Rio Tinto and BHP, and a permit dispute with the Indonesian government for\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nFreeport-McMoRan\nInc.\u2019s Grasberg mine. The two mines account for about 8% to 9% of global copper supply, according to analysts. Glencore took direct action to move copper supplies out of the market, shutting down a large African mine in 2015 in hopes of refurbishing it and reopening it this year when prices rebound. The company also shut down some of its production of coal and zinc in a similar bid to boost prices. \u201cWe\u2019ve contributed to restoring balance in the supply fundamentals,\u201d Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg said in a company tweet last week."]
["Business", "While most experts say they expect copper prices to remain strong in the near term, China\u2019s economy hangs over the market. The slightest hiccup there can send painful ripples through the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s China that\u2019s driving the market,\u201d said Paul Benjamin,  global director of copper markets at Wood Mackenzie.  To be sure, miners\u2019 are also buoyed by the surging price of other metals and commodities such as coal and iron ore. And most miners\u2019 stocks remain well below the nosebleed levels they reached several years ago at the height of the China-fueled commodity \u201csupercycle.\u201d But more than the other materials, the resurgence of copper prices is a boon for strategic bets made recently by big miners. Rio Tinto recently said it would advance production at a major mine in Mongolia that will be one of the world\u2019s biggest when it starts producing in 2020. Rio Tinto has bulked up its copper profile to help diversify away from iron ore and coal, and CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques was installed last year after running the company\u2019s copper division. Glencore on Monday raised its copper bet with a $534 million deal to buy out a large partner\u2019s stakes in Katanga and another big Congolese copper mine. Copper accounted for 33% of Glencore\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first half of 2016, and 18% of Anglo\u2019s total."]

["Technology", "Amazon said its new headquarters would be equal in stature to the company\u2019s Seattle-area home base and would house 50,000 employees. No location has been chosen, but the company says it is seeking an urban locale close to good universities and a major airport. Executives will be allowed to decide where they want to locate their teams, the company said.

In fact, a dual-headquarters setup can benefit companies because the structure can foster a diversity of thought among top executives, said Deborah Ancona, director of the Leadership Center at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cWith one center, the headquarters can become a place where people just agree with the CEO and top team, and so it becomes an insular environment,\u201d Ms. Ancona said. \u201cWith one central place, those people in other parts of the world often feel out of the mainstream.\u201d Two years after Lenovo Group Ltd. purchased\n            IBM\n\u2019s\n      PC business in 2005, the company\u2019s Beijing-based CEO, Yang Yuanqing moved his family to the combined PC maker\u2019s second headquarters near Raleigh, N.C., to \u201csignal to both parts of the company that we have to operate as one business,\u201d said Lenovo spokesman, Ray Gorman."]
["Technology", "Still, few companies choose to have dual headquarters unless they result from a merger, said Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated thing to do which is why it\u2019s rare,\u201d he said. Bosses must figuring out how to split up employees and departments so they can collaborate effectively from thousands of miles away. Decreasing face time can increase competition among colleagues, Mr. Gordon said, which could be dangerous for a company like Amazon already known for a sharp-elbowed culture. He\u2019s also skeptical Amazon will really let senior employees choose where to put their teams. \u201cI predict that if they start off that way, they\u2019ll end up pulling back from that,\u201d he said. Mr. Gordon said it would be hard to organize projects if product teams and functional divisions such as marketing and finance are placed based on manager preferences rather than what makes most sense for the business, and it could significantly increase costs such as air travel. Kay Sargent, a senior principal at architectural design and planning firm HOK, has helped companies such as Morgan Stanley,\n            Cisco Systems\n Inc.\n      and\n            Equifax\n Inc.\n      reconcile where and how to create new workspaces.

In 2015,\n            General Motors\n Co.\u2019s\n      luxury brand Cadillac uprooted from its Detroit base and moved its headquarters to a new space in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood to allow Cadillac to establish itself as a stand-alone business unit.

["U.S. News", "With political energy now being devoted to Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, it could be several months\u2014or longer\u2014before some political appointees, including antitrust enforcers, are confirmed and installed. \u201cIt\u2019s a very clumsy part of our political process,\u201d said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former Republican chairman of the FTC. \u201cYou have these awkward handoffs, and the interim leadership doesn\u2019t quite have the mandate to put real force behind their program.\u201d Eight years ago, Democratic President Barack Obama nominated several Justice Department leaders, including for antitrust, two days after he took office. \u00a0\u00a0His first antitrust chief, Christine Varney, wasn\u2019t confirmed until that April, but she was able to arrange for a like-minded chief of staff to enter the Justice Department earlier, taking the enforcement reins with the administration\u2019s priorities in mind. Not all recent presidents have moved as quickly as Mr. Obama, but George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, both Republicans, had chosen their antitrust chiefs by this point in their administrations. As some companies now brace for a potentially longer wait on antitrust decisions, the uncertainty also could affect what types of concessions some merging parties need to make to get their deals approved because Republican enforcers are considered more flexible on merger remedies. And there are court cases that could take a different turn depending on when Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees take office."]

["U.S. News", "At the FTC, power on the five-member panel is split between Republican Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chairwoman and a candidate to hold the role permanently, and Democrat Terrell McSweeny.

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes is also under consideration to be FTC chairman. Mr. Trump has offered few thoughts about antitrust policy.\u00a0 His long history as a deal maker would suggest sympathy with corporate mergers, but his populist tone and his criticism of the AT&T-Time Warner deal have raised questions about whether he would favor more intervention than past Republicans.

This is paving the way for authoritarianism under one-man rule,\u201d said Utku Cakirozer, a lawmaker with the main-opposition Republican People\u2019s Party. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s predecessor as president, AKP co-founder Abdullah Gul, said the situation risks Turkey\u2019s institutions. \u201cElections are without a doubt the foundation of democracy, but if you leave it at that it would lead to a majoritarian understanding and that\u2019s not true democracy,\u201d Mr. Gul said. \u201cOne of Turkey\u2019s biggest issues is checks-and-balances; the political parties aren\u2019t powerful enough to challenge each other, and individuals can make mistakes.\u201d Observers\u00a0from Sivas to Washington\u00a0say Mr. Erdogan has accumulated power through deft pivots: spotlighting an Islamist agenda in certain situations, and downplaying Islam in others.  His party swept to power in 2002 after\u00a0courting European and\u00a0U.S.\u00a0policy makers enamored by the thought of\u00a0an Islamist democratic party in the mold of Christian Democrats like Germany\u2019s.  Many Turks who favored Islamic-rooted government initially didn\u2019t support him. Mr.\u00a0Toraman in Sivas didn\u2019t trust the AKP\u2019s Western-oriented agenda. Although Mr. Erdogan sought to expand rights for observant Muslims held back by secular rule, he did so within a campaign to persuade Europe Turkey belonged in the EU.

["Experiential", "After antigovernment protests broke out in 2013, starting with environmentalist opposition to commercial development of an Istanbul park, Mr. Erdogan embraced more overtly Islamist\u00a0and nationalist\u00a0policies.

None of this dents a cultivated down-home image, which Mr. Erdogan burnishes in televised meetings with local officials called mukhtars. Ahmet Dagasan, from the Gultepe neighborhood in Sivas, attended a gathering last year. Mr. Erdogan discussed topics from Syria to Kurdish insurgents.

In 2002 when his party gained power, many Kurds, liberals and Alevis\u2014members of a Shia offshoot of Islam\u2014were hopeful the AKP would bring a more inclusive political culture. That hope died, said Ali Dag, an Alevi leader, when Mr.\u00a0Erdogan\u00a0started invoking the phrase \u201cnational will\u201d to defend his policies, which primarily cater to his Islamist supporters. Mr.\u00a0Erdogan\u00a0has ignored pleas from minorities in favor of rhetoric that galvanizes nationalist feeling and the Sunni majority. The president dismisses such allegations, pointing to initiatives such as returning state-seized properties to religious minorities. He has said he embraces everyone who upholds four principles: one nation, one flag, one homeland and one state.  Kurds, who are 20% of the population, are the latest to find their fate intertwined with Mr.\u00a0Erdogan\u2019s ambitions.  A three-decade insurgency by the Kurdish group PKK, which Turkey and its NATO allies list as terrorist, finally led to peace talks with the government in 2013. They were mediated by the legal pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or HDP."]

With voters spooked by rising violence and insecurity, the AKP was propelled back to majority control of parliament. \u201cErdogan\u00a0really is dragging Turkey toward Third-World standards, a total dictatorial structure and culture of obedience whereby he crushes anyone who is not subservient,\u201d an HDP member of parliament, Garo Paylan, said in an interview.

The world\u2019s largest mining company by market value said the threat of rising protectionism risks derailing a recovery in global commodity markets that has pulled the resources industry out of one of the deepest downturns in decades. In particular, BHP said the policy platform of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration could spark trade wars that weigh on business confidence, hurt investment and lead to higher inflation in the U.S. BHP\u2019s remarks are stronger than recent statements of other mining executives, some of whom have hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s policies as mining-friendly."]
["Earnings", " BHP and rivals including\n        Rio Tinto\n          \n      PLC have rebuilt their profits on selling commodities like iron ore that form the backbone of infrastructure from highways to high-rise apartment blocks. They have also invested more in copper, anticipating that rising incomes in China and elsewhere will spur demand for a commodity used in consumer products such as saucepans and iPads. On Tuesday, BHP reported a net profit of US$3.20 billion for the six months through December, compared with a loss of US$5.67 billion in the same period a year earlier when its bottom line was weighed by large write-downs against its U.S. energy assets. Directors lifted the half-year payout to 40 U.S. cents a share from 16 cents this time last year, beating market expectations. However, BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie was wary of the protectionist rhetoric coming from the White House, even though a separate campaign pledge by Mr. Trump to unlock US$1 trillion in infrastructure spending could be good for commodity demand. \u201cWhilst there may be some short-term winners from some policies of protection and increased trade wars, most of us will be losers, and certainly the future demand for our products could potentially suffer if that were to spread,\u201d Mr. Mackenzie said. Mr. Trump has criticized the trade policy of previous presidents and blamed prior trade deals for job losses. One of his first actions as president was to withdraw formally from the 12-nation Pacific trade agreement that had been a flagship policy of the former Obama administration."]
["Earnings", "Mr. Trump has singled out China for criticism, accusing it of keeping its currency artificially weak to support local manufacturers. BHP said China\u2019s exports could be challenged by rising protectionism, which would be a problem for mining companies as Beijing is the top buyer of many commodities including iron ore. Mark Cutifani, chief executive of London mining giant\n            Anglo American\n            \n      PLC, has cautioned Mr. Trump against pushing the world toward protectionism. Anglo reported on Tuesday that it had returned to profit in 2016. BHP said it expects global growth to remain between 3% and 3.5% in 2017\u2014with any improvement beyond that level delayed by what Mr. Mackenzie described as \u201cquite a marked rise in geopolitical uncertainty or forecastability.\u201d Mr. Mackenzie said it is too early to comment on how White House policy may affect its investments in the U.S. BHP\u2019s U.S. business centers on oil-and-gas assets, though, that are quicker to ramp up and down than mining operations, he said. \u201cWe can respond relatively quickly when the policy outlook is a little bit clearer,\u201d Mr. Mackenzie said. \n\u2018Whilst there may be some short-term winners from some policies of protection and increased trade wars, most of us will be losers.\u2019\n He and BHP Chairman Jac Nasser met with Mr. Trump, then President-elect, in January, during which they discussed the impact the U.S. policy direction could have on resources markets, Mr. Mackenzie said."]
["Earnings", "He said he also pressed the importance of the international climate-change agreement reached in Paris, which BHP supports, although he declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s responses in the meeting. In contrast to the hawkish U.S. trade policy adopted by Mr. Trump, Asian governments were moving toward increasingly liberal trade regimes, which could be positive for resources demand in many key markets. BHP\u2019s underlying profit\u2014which strips out one-off items\u2014increased to US$3.24 billion in its fiscal first half from US$412 million a year earlier, as it rode the recovery in global commodity markets. The price of iron ore roughly doubled last year from a more than decade low, while commodities including coal and copper also rose.  Mr. Mackenzie said BHP is confident in the long-term outlook for the commodities it produces, particularly oil.

Pressed by senators, Mr. McCabe testified he would report to Congress if there was any effort to interfere in the FBI\u2019s probe of Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the election or potential collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied interfering in the election, and the GOP president has said his associates didn\u2019t collude with Moscow."]
["Politics and Policy", "Mr. McCabe also declined to say whether Mr. Comey had told Mr. Trump he wasn\u2019t under investigation. That question arose because Mr. Trump, in his brief letter firing Mr. Comey on Tuesday, said \u201cI greatly appreciate your informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.\u201d Mr. McCabe said he couldn\u2019t confirm or deny that. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on any conversations the director may have had with the president,\u201d Mr. McCabe said. He also pledged to Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) during the hearing that as acting FBI director, he would refrain from providing any status updates to the White House on the Russia probe. Mr. Comey\u2019s unexpected firing this week sent shock waves through Washington, ending a difficult two-year period for the bureau\u2019s embattled director, who was responsible for steering the agency through probes into both presidential candidates last year. Mr. Comey oversaw a politically charged investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over her possible mishandling of classified material, and he was in the midst of supervising the Trump probe when he was fired. Democrats and some Republicans have expressed concerns about the timing of the firing and have asked whether Mr. Comey was fired because he was intensifying the Russia probe. Mr. Comey told superiors at the Justice Department that he wanted more resources for the probe, according to people familiar with the matter. The Justice Department denies that more resources were requested, and Mr. McCabe Thursday also cast doubt on that assertion. "]

Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) and Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D., Va.) spoke jointly at a news conference after the meeting, expressing confidence that their Senate investigation would continue apace and reach its conclusion regardless of the FBI probe.  \u201cThis investigation will go forward and will be completed,\u201d Mr. Burr said, adding that the committee staff was getting unprecedented access to information gathered by the FBI for the purposes of the Russia probe, which is looking at alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.  The White House has routinely played down the seriousness of the Russia probe that is looking at whether associates or campaign aides coordinated with Russia. Mr. Trump alleged in his letter firing Mr. Comey that he was told three times by the former director that he wasn\u2019t under investigation in the bureau\u2019s Russia probe. Mr. McCabe disputed that characterization, saying that the probe was a \u201chighly significant investigation\u201d to which the bureau was dedicating significant resources.  His testimony also contradicted White House assertions that Mr. Comey had lost the support of rank-and-file FBI employees and had become a distraction.

["Markets Main", "\nCarlyle Group\n            \n      LP and\n            BlackRock\n Inc.\n      are among other big investment firms that moved recently to beef up their infrastructure investing businesses. The Blackstone fund will have a broad mandate to find investments, according to a person familiar with the firm\u2019s plans, with the ability to invest in things such as hospitals as well as assets that are more typically considered infrastructure, such as pipelines, roads and utilities. Also, unlike most of the private funds the New York firm manages, which lock up investors\u2019 cash for 10 years or so, the infrastructure fund will have no expiration date. That structure gives the firm more time to find investments and reduces the pressure to sell them on a deadline. Both features could help Blackstone circumvent two big issues infrastructure investors have encountered in the U.S.: limited investment opportunities outside the energy sector, and uncertainty over who will eventually buy some assets, such as roads and municipal utilities. Saudi officials, who are seeking to diversify the kingdom\u2019s economy by investing its oil wealth, on Saturday alluded to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to steer $1 trillion into U.S. public works. The Public Investment Fund managing director, Yasir Al Rumayyan,  said the pact reflects \u201cour positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the United States as\u00a0announced by President Trump.\u201d"]
["Markets Main", "Yet the flood of cash into infrastructure funds can mostly be attributed to fairly reliable returns that sometimes beat the stock market and often outperform private-equity funds that make arguably riskier investments, such as corporate buyouts, according to Preqin. Still, there have been some prominent flops, including a rash of bankrupt toll roads. Through late last year, the median annualized return after fees from infrastructure funds launched between 2004 and 2013 has ranged from 5.7% for those that began investing in 2007 to 14.4% for funds launched in 2004, according to Preqin. Blackstone\u2019s foray into infrastructure won\u2019t be its first as it once struggled to raise a fund in the wake of the financial crisis. The executives who led the effort left the firm and in 2011 launched their own firm, Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners.

China proposed that during the trip, Mr. Trump and his counterpart, Xi Jinping,  unveil a plan to widen foreign firms\u2019 access to China\u2019s vast financial industry, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It was a move previous U.S. administrations had sought for years. To Beijing\u2019s consternation, according to the people, Washington wasn\u2019t interested. The offer was made a second time during one of Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings at the Great Hall of the People. Hours after Air Force One took off from Beijing, China announced the opening on its own."]
["World News", "The cold shoulder from the White House reflects a fundamental shift in how the U.S. manages its relationship with China, one that suggests a bold gamble and a rocky road ahead despite the bonhomie of the presidential summit earlier this month in Beijing. The financial opening initially attracted wide attention from market participants, and Beijing called it evidence of its commitment to market liberalization. U.S. reaction has been tepid. A White House spokeswoman on Friday called it \u201cwelcome but long overdue\u201d and said: \u201cIt is also only one of a plethora of problems China needs to address in order to provide fair and reciprocal access to its market.\u201d The Trump administration, which recently completed a comprehensive review of China policy, is rejecting the longstanding practice of eking out concessions from Beijing on trade and market access around high-level meetings. To Mr. Trump and his aides, that approach has yielded few substantive benefits but allowed China to continue policies that put American businesses at a disadvantage. One White House official refers to that pattern as Beijing\u2019s \u201crope-a-dope\u201d strategy. The administration is now investigating trade sanctions or enforcement actions against China with the goal of fundamentally challenging Chinese trade practices. The White House is also trying to invest in the personal relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi to absorb some of the shock of the coming trade measures."]
["World News", "That helps explain Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox blend of tough talk on trade and effusive praise for Mr. Xi in Beijing. In China and around the globe, the White House is aiming to make an asset out of Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability, which has been criticized by foreign-policy experts as a destabilizing influence on international negotiations over trade and national security.  \u201cThe U.S. now believes that only the threat of unilateral action will compel China to change,\u201d says Scott Kennedy,  a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. The new China strategy carries considerable risk. Some policy experts fear it could set off a trade war. Others, especially advocates of harsh sanctions, worry Mr. Trump might not follow through if Beijing steps up its charm offensive with further attempts to flatter him or if his agenda becomes monopolized by domestic issues, especially the tax overhaul proposed by the Republicans in Congress. Still, in Beijing, the prospect of a much tougher U.S. stance is starting to sink in. China had hoped to show it is doing its part to improve the relationship by granting Mr. Trump a \u201cstate-visit-plus\u201d\u2014including a private dinner with Mr. Xi in the Forbidden City\u2014and opening the financial sector. \u201cChina realizes that it can\u2019t continue to drive away foreign capital,\u201d says He Fan, a professor at Peking University HSBC School of Business. \u201cIt likely will take more measures to open up its economy.\u201d"]
["World News", "Beijing is likely to point to any opening measures, however symbolic, to argue against unilateral action by Washington.  Under the new financial opening, Beijing pledged to let foreign securities firms own majority stakes in their Chinese ventures and to scrap foreign ownership limits on Chinese banks. Officials indicated the security-industry changes would be limited, at least initially.  Western officials treat such pronouncements with skepticism, pointing to China\u2019s poor follow-up record and saying hurdles have grown despite similar pledges in the past. \u201cThis opening-up comes at a late stage in development,\u201d said the European Chamber of Commerce in a statement. \u201cIt is now difficult for foreign firms to capitalize on these changes as domestic Chinese firms have stronger positions in their respective industry.\u201d  Such views are shared by U.S. officials. \u201cThe overall approach now is not to negotiate over crumbs, not celebrate small deals that will have limited impact,\u201d one official said. While attending meetings by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington in October, China\u2019s Vice Finance minister Zhu Guangyao told U.S. officials about the new financial-opening plan, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The Chinese side had expected U.S. officials would welcome the proposal and agree to roll it out as a breakthrough during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Beijing.  Instead, U.S. officials called it too little too late."]
["World News", "\u201cWe said, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to take your gifts because you\u2019re just trying to sucker us,\u2019\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the discussions. \u201cThe idea with China is no negotiation because it will just make us beholden to them and reluctant to slam them on other stuff.\u201d The Trump administration trade team is weighing a half-dozen trade enforcement actions that are aimed directly, or indirectly, at China, with decisions expected by early next year. The team is looking at invoking a Cold War-era law that was last used in the early 1980s to block steel and aluminum imports in the name of national security. It is also studying dusting off another law last used in 2002 to protect domestic producers claiming to have been damaged by a sudden surge of cheap imports; solar panels and washing machines are goods in focus. The U.S. and China are vying for influence in Asia, but tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s focus on prioritizing American interests, have complicated Washington's agenda. Photo: AP Shortly before Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Beijing, his Commerce Department issued a lengthy study justifying the continuing branding of China as a \u201cnonmarket economy,\u201d a status that allows the U.S. to impose extra high duties on Chinese imports found to have been illegally subsidized or \u201cdumped\u201d below production costs. Commerce has since imposed duties of up to 162% on Chinese aluminum foil and 194% for hardwood plywood. China has filed a complaint over that designation to the World Trade Organization."]
["World News", "At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agency is building a broad case to charge China with \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d by improperly pressuring American companies to turn over valuable intellectual property as the price for entering the Chinese market.  Still, the question is when, or whether, the administration will actually take action on these fronts. So far, trade enforcement has taken a back seat to White House priorities such as winning passage of a tax cut and securing Chinese cooperation to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. U.S. officials have struggled to find remedies that won\u2019t trigger a wide backlash from industries that consume Chinese products or free-trade Republicans in Congress. Excessively harsh sanctions could also provoke a full-blown trade war, some policy experts say. Although an open line to Mr. Xi could help in managing a trade crisis and allow for more meaningful deal-making, efforts to forge a personal rapport with previous Chinese leaders have rarely borne fruit. \u201cThe development of personal relations is a fact, not a strategy,\u201d the White House spokeswoman said. Messrs. Trump and Xi \u201cseem to have established a good personal relationship, as the president has with many world leaders,\u201d she added. Already, some supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s promised China trade crackdown have grown frustrated at the limited results. The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group formed by the United Steelworkers union and U.S. steelmakers, praised Mr. Trump in April when he launched his study on national-security steel tariffs, and his aides had promised action by June."]

Utilities are focused on maintaining deductions for interest payments on their heavy borrowing. Multinationals worry a potential excise tax on transactions from U.S. units to foreign affiliates could disrupt global supply chains or crimp investment in operations that employ thousands of U.S. workers. And concern lingers among CEOs of all stripes about whether lawmakers can pass a tax bill at all by year\u2019s end."]
["Management & Careers", "Most executives laud the outlines of the tax bills taking shape on Capitol Hill. But in interviews with corporate chiefs attending the annual Wall Street Journal CEO Council in Washington, many say they are focused on narrower provisions.  Executives say they are unsure the tax overhaul will happen before the end of the year, as the White House and Republican congressional leaders have pledged.  A majority attending an onstage interview with Gary Cohn,  the president\u2019s top economic adviser, said they didn\u2019t expect lawmakers to meet the self-imposed deadline. \u201cWe\u2019re planning next year as if there\u2019s no change,\u201d said Michael McKelvy,  chief executive of construction firm Gilbane Building Co., which has $5 billion in annual revenues and works with developers in the U.S. and overseas. Congressional Republicans have said that the tax plans would boost spending on plants, machinery and other equipment in the U.S. Yet when asked Tuesday morning whether the tax bill would prompt them raise U.S. investments, only a smattering of the executives raised their hands. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the other hands up?\u201d Mr. Cohn asked the audience. In a speech to the group later, Vice President Mike Pence pressed the executives to promote the tax plan to their employees and said that lower taxes would lead to more business investment. Nick Akins, chief executive of Columbus, Ohio-based\n            American Electric Power\n Co.\n      , is closely following a provision limiting the deduction of business-interest payments. Utilities, which rely heavily on debt to make major capital investments, have so far succeeded in persuading lawmakers to carve out an exception for them, he said. "]
["Management & Careers", "\u201cWe were really fearful, because it takes years to work that out in the regulatory process,\u201d Mr. Akins said.   Paul Browning,  CEO of Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Americas Inc., said he is watching proposals for an excise tax on transactions between U.S. and foreign units of the same company\u2014and will be visiting Capitol Hill this week to talk to lawmakers about it. The company, a joint venture of\n            Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\n Ltd.\n      and\n        Hitachi\n Ltd.\n      , exports U.S.-made power generation equipment, he said, but it also uses imported parts and equipment that could leave it subject to the excise tax. \u201cWe just want to make sure that anything that comes out in the tax bill doesn\u2019t disincentivize foreign direct investment,\u201d Mr. Browning said. Executive opinion isn\u2019t unanimous even on lower corporate rates\u2014or whether taxes are the most important issue for their businesses.   Charles Phillips, CEO of business-software company Infor Inc., said the House and Senate plans, which both call for lowering the corporate tax rate to 20%, wouldn\u2019t improve his company\u2019s effective tax rate significantly.  He added that a tax overhaul could provide an indirect benefit if it helped lift overall spending by business customers and consumers. A change in the corporate tax rate itself, though, wouldn\u2019t likely change Infor\u2019s investment plans, he said."]
["Management & Careers", "\u201cWe invest based on opportunity, not on tax rates,\u201d he said.  Mr. McKelvy, the construction-firm CEO, said he is more worried about finding skilled workers than he is about the tax bill. \u201cThe biggest problem we\u2019re facing is not policy, it\u2019s the need for people,\u201d he said.  Michael J. Wolf,  CEO of management-consulting firm Activate Inc., said he prefers tax cuts for individuals and middle-class families, and provisions to protect benefits for working Americans, because it would do more for economic growth. \u201cThe focus should be on a tax structure that\u2019s going to drive prosperity in general,\u201d he said.

They figured that would mean winning 30 medals\u2014which would have been the most ever for Norway\u2014and 10 gold medals. They had already won 29 medals and 11 gold medals through Tuesday. There were five days left in the Olympics. The Americans had only 12 medals total. As if it weren\u2019t enough that Norway has almost tripled the U.S.\u2019s medal count, Norway is even almost-winning as much as the U.S.: The Norwegians and Americans both had 10 fourth-place finishes through Tuesday\u2019s events.

The competition to win Amazon\u2019s business likely will be fierce and could break records for tax incentive packages, according to consultants who advise companies and governments on such deals. \u201dI would expect the interest to be unmatched and unrestrained by every location, even ones that really don\u2019t have much of a shot,\u201d said Mark Sweeney,  partner at the Greenville, S.C.-based McCallum SweeneyConsulting. Mr. Sweeney\u2019s firm advised\n            Boeing\n Co.\n      on its $3.2 billion tax-incentive package with the state of Washington in 2003 to manufacture a new jet there. In 2013, Boeing Co. received an $8.7 billion tax-incentive package with the state of Washington that set a U.S. record. Mr. Sweeney, who didn\u2019t work on that deal, anticipates states will offer Amazon a package in \u201cthat neighborhood.\u201d "]
["Technology", "In addition to tax breaks on property, state and city income tax, Mr. Sweeney says states could offer to pay Amazon cash through tax rebates. Other incentives such as grants for training employees, adding public transportation or expedited permit approvals could also be part of a deal, consultants said. Amazon said it would prefer its new headquarters to be in a metropolitan area with more than a million people, near a strong university system and within 45 minutes of an international airport. The project likely will go down as one of the biggest economic developments announced in a decade, said Greg Burkart,  a Detroit-based consultant with Duff & Phelps Corp. \u201cThis is the same economic impact as a medium-size city,\u201d he said.  Over the past two decades, Amazon has grown from an online bookseller founded in Mr. Bezos\u2019s garage to a sprawling tech giant. It now has a Hollywood studio, a booming device business including its artificial intelligence assistant Alexa, and a profit-driving cloud-computing service. The number of employees at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters has grown rapidly over the past decade from a few thousand to more than 40,000. But Amazon recently has faced both space and hiring constraints as a result, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos in 1999 discusses with The Wall Street Journal how the company goes about hiring to fuel growth that (as the Journal said then) had rocketed Amazon in just four years from an idea to an industry giant with a staff of 3,000."]
["Technology", "Amazon has struggled to attract and retain enough engineers to keep pace with the company\u2019s growth, the people said. It competes for talent in the region with\n            Microsoft\n Corp.\n      , and is about 800 miles north of the heart of the tech world, California\u2019s Silicon Valley. It is unlikely Amazon would choose a location in an area like Silicon Valley, where it would face intense competition for engineers from companies including\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet\n Inc.\n      and\n            Apple\n Inc.\n      \u201cThere\u2019s only so much talent,\u201d says Tom Gimbel,  founder and CEO of national staffing and recruiting firm LaSalle Network.

["Technology", "Amazon is used to divvying up work between employees across multiple time zones and buildings. Mr. Bezos tries to maintain a startup culture despite the company\u2019s size. Teams are typically kept small\u2014if a group can\u2019t be fed with two pizzas, it is too big\u2014and there is a strict process for developing new ideas and inventing devices, which includes writing six-page papers for explanation.  Amazon has 33 buildings at its headquarters in Seattle, comprising 8.1 million square feet. Across the U.S., it employs more than 200,000 people, with about 130,000 in the company\u2019s warehouses. It just added an additional roughly 87,000, primarily in the U.S., with its acquisition of Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. The company already has regional offices sprinkled throughout the U.S., including in Austin, Northern Virginia, Detroit and Los Angeles. The new headquarters will be in addition to those locations. Amazon said it plans to build the project in phases, with $5 billion in capital investment over the first 15 to 17 years. The first phase of building, for between 500,000 square feet and 1 million square feet of office space ready in 2019, will result in an estimated $300 million to $600 million capital investment, it said. The company will consider existing buildings and greenfield sites of 100 acres.  Communities are eager to land a flagship corporate tenant because of the positive impact on the service sector. Amazon\u2019s existing Seattle headquarters, which it moved downtown in 2010, has since brought an additional $38 billion in investments to the local economy through 2016, the company said."]

["Streetwise", "The French fears can be pinned down more precisely. The standard measure of eurozone panic, the spread of French bond yields over Germany\u2019s safe-haven bunds, dropped by the most since the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011, and had its second-best day since the calm of the 2000s. European bank stocks soared 7.4%, but the jump was somewhat less notable, only slightly above three big daily gains early last year and frequently exceeded during the rescues from 2008-2012. The euro\u2019s initial 2% leap against the dollar after the French result on Sunday night would have been the best in a year if sustained, but faded back to a more ordinary 1% rally by the end of Paris\u2019 day. Meanwhile, gold and yen fell about 0.7% each\u2014notable drops but not unusual for the global sanctuaries. So the market story about France was that a populist win risked the creditworthiness of the French government, which would be very bad for European banks. The euro itself was never seen as under any serious threat, while knock-on global effects were expected to be relatively small. There is still two weeks to go until the second-round runoff between the centrist winner Emmanuel Macron and far-right runner-up Marine Le Pen. Polls suggest Mr. Macron will win with a big margin, and the mainstream losers of the first round already have backed Mr. Macron. There is clearly scope for a surprise revelation to hurt Mr. Macron\u2019s chances, but the market\u2019s gains if and when he wins are likely to be much smaller than in the tight first round."]
["Streetwise", "What about the longer run? Many investors think U.S. stocks are expensive, and for the past month or so money has been switching from U.S. funds to European funds. On the face of it, it is true that Europe is cheaper, with eurozone stocks at 15 times next year\u2019s estimated earnings, according to Thomson Reuters IBES, and the U.S. close to 18 times. European profit margins are also depressed by historic standards, helping the argument that they\u2019re more likely to rise than fall. By contrast, in the U.S., margins are close to record highs, so further gains are harder. There are three big problems with the argument that the eurozone\u2019s cheaper. Firstly, it is virtually always cheaper. Second, the cheapness is concentrated in banks, which still scare many, and oil stocks, which only look cheaper in Europe because of the collapse in U.S. shale profits. Finally, being cheaper than the most expensive major market isn\u2019t much help if Europe\u2019s still expensive itself. History shows investors demand a discount for European stocks, perhaps because of less economic dynamism, perhaps because of slower long-run profit growth, perhaps because employees have more say. The average discount since Thomson Reuters IBES data began in the mid-1980s is a discount of 2 points on the price-to-earnings ratio. Europe\u2019s current discount is even bigger than the historic norm, but all of it is down to banks and oil. Exclude those, and the discount for eurozone stocks is fractionally smaller than the long-run average."]

In rapid succession, Uber faced a lawsuit from Google parent\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\n      over allegedly stolen technology, a federal probe looking into technology used to evade regulators, an exodus of executives, and it admitted that it erroneously withheld tens of millions of dollars from New York City and Philadelphia drivers over more than two years.

Joseph Yun,  the State Department\u2019s special representative on North Korea policy, confirmed in an email that he is leaving the post but didn\u2019t elaborate on his reasons.

["World News", "Mr. Yun\u2019s departure, expected on Friday, comes at a critical moment, with North Korea indicating it is willing to talk with Washington and South Korea encouraging the Trump administration to find a way to open a dialogue with Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime. Differences have surfaced within the Trump administration about the utility of negotiations and what they might achieve, even though tensions appear to be easing on the peninsula.  Mr. Yun and others at the State Department have wanted to enter preliminary discussions with Pyongyang\u2014often called \u201ctalks about talks\u201d\u2014as South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in has urged Washington to do.  White House officials, however, want to see meaningful indications that North Korea is prepared to roll back its nuclear arsenal before beginning negotiations and suspects that Pyongyang is still trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul, officials said. \u201cWe want to talk only under the right conditions,\u201d President Donald Trump said at the White House on Monday.  Heather Nauert,  the State Department press secretary, attributed Mr. Yun\u2019s departure to \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Mr. Yun to stay but he demurred, an administration official said. \u201cWe are fully confident that we have terrific, qualified, experienced people who will take this on and continue our maximum-pressure campaign. Our policy has not changed,\u201d Ms. Nauert said. There are no immediate plans for a new special representative to succeed Mr. Yun but officials will search for his replacement once he leaves, she said. "]

Vice President Mike Pence had been prepared to meet earlier this month with North Korean representatives at the Winter Olympics, but Pyongyang canceled the meeting. The Trump administration hasn\u2019t articulated a longer-term approach on talks.  \u201cIf the administration is serious about diplomacy, it needs to have the right person doing it and it needs to have a game plan, and it is not clear it has either yet,\u201d said Joel S.

That alone makes them a difficult target, and recent FSA offensives there had only limited success."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cYou are fighting against someone who is defending his own village. And our guys fighting there are the cousins of the guys they are fighting against,\u201d said Maj. Issam al-Reis,  spokesman for the FSA\u2019s Southern Front. Islamic State\u2019s main region of control is in northeastern Syria and neighboring parts of western Iraq, an area that has been shrinking under recent attacks by Iraqi troops, Kurdish militias and, as of late, the Turkish army.  Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend,  the new commander of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview late Wednesday that he thinks the battle to retake Mosul will begin in the coming weeks. However, the push to retake Raqqa in Syria is on hold, he said. Unlike in those areas, the U.S. hasn't launched airstrikes against the militants in the Yarmouk Basin, even though Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in July the U.S. was planning to expand the campaign against Islamic State to southern Syria. The U.S. officially listed the main militant group in the Yarmouk Basin, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, as a terrorist organization in June, noting that it had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Eager not to provoke Israel or Jordan, however, the group, which gained notoriety for kidnapping United Nations observers in 2013, has so far refrained from cross-border attacks. \n"]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cJordan or Israel, if they wanted to, could destroy them in five minutes,\u201d said Mohammed al-Zubani,  a senior commander with the FSA\u2019s Salahuddin Brigade. \u201cThe Syrian regime, meanwhile, is happy that this is happening. The presence of ISIS in south Syria is useful to the regime because this way the FSA will be busy fighting ISIS instead of fighting the regime.\u201d In northern Syria, a cessation of hostilities between the rebels and the regime collapsed in July, with the two sides fighting for control of the country\u2019s biggest city of Aleppo. But the front lines between Syrian government forces and the FSA have remained relatively quiet in the far south in recent months. In part, that is because Jordan, unlike Syria\u2019s northern neighbor Turkey, is more interested in ensuring quiet on its border than spurring a regime change in Damascus. The U.S. and its Western and regional allies maintain in Jordan the so-called Military Operations Command, or MOC, a secretive body that coordinates efforts to support FSA-affiliated rebels with funding, ammunition and intelligence. Rebel commanders said the MOC, after a four-month lull in paying salaries, has recently informed the rebel groups that payments would resume at $60 a month for a fighter in the rear and $150 a month for those on the front lines against Islamic State. Operations in the Yarmouk Basin, slow since a surprise militant offensive in March and a successful rebel counteroffensive that followed, have picked up in recent days."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "The ease with which an Islamic State enclave has emerged in southern Syria makes many rebels\u2014and many Jordanians\u2014worry about what would happen once Islamic State\u2019s main cities of Raqqa and Mosul are liberated. Already, there has been movement by Islamic State fighters to the desert settlements in southeastern Syria.  \u201cJordan has been working very hard with all parties to keep the southern part of Syria calm for our own security reasons,\u201d said retired Jordanian Maj. Gen. Mahmoud Irdaisat. \u201cBut the situation could deteriorate if we see advances on Mosul or Raqqa. It is expected that those fleeing from there will go to the south because it is seen as a soft area.\u201d Though the extremist fighters in the Yarmouk Basin, now operating as part of an alliance known as the Khalid bin Walid Army, are thought by FSA commanders to number only about 600, with a dozen or so tanks, the terrain of mountains and deep ravines is difficult for offensive operations.  Although the pocket is theoretically besieged by the FSA, that blockade is anything but hermetic, and there has been an influx of operatives, including senior commanders sent from Raqqa, and weapons into the area, FSA officers add. \u201cThe siege isn't 100%.

["Business", "\u201cI felt like 15 or 16 years was plenty of time to be CEO,\u201d Mr. Immelt, who turned 61 earlier this year, said in an interview Monday. \u201cDoing it until I\u2019m 65 didn\u2019t make sense for the company and didn\u2019t make sense for me.\u201d The change comes as GE has been under pressure by activist investor Trian Fund Management LP to slash costs and boost profits in the company\u2019s core industrial business. Mr. Immelt recently laid out a two-year cost saving target and revamped GE\u2019s bonus program under pressure from Trian.  When Mr. Immelt took over in 2001, GE got about half its annual profit from its finance arm, GE Capital, and was one of the country\u2019s biggest lenders. Now, the company relies on selling and servicing jet engines, power turbines, hospital machines and oil-and-gas equipment for nearly all of its profit.  Mr. Flannery, in a meeting for employees Monday that was broadcast on Facebook, said he would be taking a look at the conglomerate\u2019s entire portfolio of businesses. \u201cI want to start with a fresh look around the company overall,\u201d he said, expecting to come back in the Fall with a set of recommendations. \u201cI want to go through a deep review with a sense of urgency.\u201d Some Wall Street analysts have openly wondered about when Mr. Immelt might retire, but the CEO gave no public sign he was ready to step aside and swatted away succession questions. Mr. Immelt and an independent GE director said Monday that he had decided in 2013 to step aside at some point this year as part of a long-term succession process."]
["Business", "The timing was \u201ccompletely unaffected by what was going on with Trian and their criticism,\u2019\u2019 said Shelly Lazarus,  a longtime GE director and a former CEO of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. \u201cThere was no reason to divert from the path.\u201d  Trian executives weren\u2019t involved in the process and weren\u2019t briefed on the change, people familiar with the matter said. Trian had voiced support for Mr. Immelt when it initially disclosed its investment in 2015, but had recently become frustrated with the company\u2019s performance, people familiar with the matter said. Trian declined to comment Monday on Mr. Flannery\u2019s selection.  Mr. Immelt sold off GE\u2019s media unit and divested the bulk of the company\u2019s massive lending division after the financial crisis. The conglomerate has refocused on its industrial businesses, shedding low-margin units like home appliances and striking a big oil-and-gas deal with Baker Hughes Inc. last fall.  But the company\u2019s shares have lagged behind peers and the broader stock market during Mr. Immelt\u2019s tenure, leaving it the worst performing current member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock has fallen about 27% since Mr. Immelt took over days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Including dividends, GE gained 21% with Mr. Immelt at the helm, compared with a 207% rise in the S&P 500. GE shares rose 3.6% to $28.94 Monday. Mr. Flannery is the former head of GE\u2019s India business and former leader of its deals team. "]
["Business", "On Mr. Flannery\u2019s watch, GE spun off its consumer credit business,\n            Synchrony Financial\n            \n      ; sold its appliance business; and purchased the energy business of Alstom SA. He stepped in to lead the health-care business in 2014 when the unit was struggling and some analysts called for GE to spin it off or sell it. Instead, Mr. Flannery and GE have doubled down. The unit, which makes imaging and diagnostic equipment, has been expanding into life sciences. GE Healthcare\u2019s revenue rose to $18.29 billion in 2016, back to levels it sustained at the beginning of the decade, while increasing operating profits. Although Mr. Flannery spent much of his career in GE Capital and business development, he said he also had experience working abroad in emerging markets like India and running large business units. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to the table cold, if you will, about the company,\u201d he said on a conference call with analysts. GE\u2019s succession planning process, which included external candidates, was narrowed to four internal candidates in about 2015: Mr. Flannery, finance chief Jeff Bornstein, Steve Bolze,  who leads the power business, and the head of the oil and gas business, Lorenzo Simonelli."]
["Business", "Mr. Bornstein, who has been finance chief since 2013, will remain in that role and become a vice chairman. Mr. Flannery will take over as chairman of the board on Jan. 1. Mr. Simonelli will run a publicly traded oil and gas business that is being merged with\n        Baker Hughes\n Inc.,\n      GE has previously said. It is unclear what role Mr. Bolze will play. Messrs. Bolze and Simonelli weren\u2019t available for comment.  Jack Brennan,  the GE board\u2019s lead independent director, recently helped directors reach a consensus about Mr. Flannery. Over the past few weeks, Mr. Brennan called each board member and requested their preferred pick to succeed Mr. Immelt, according to Ms. Lazarus.  \n\u2018I want to start with a fresh look around the company overall.\u2019\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to give an answer,\u2019\u2019 she said. Ms. Lazarus said she endorsed Mr. Flannery because she liked his extensive international experience, humility and willingness to consider significant changes, including selling off big business units.  The other internal contenders \u201cdidn\u2019t know they didn\u2019t get it\u201d until after Friday\u2019s board meeting ended, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Immelt said the company didn\u2019t plan to make any changes to its executive compensation plans to retain other top executives and was sticking to its recent financial forecasts. Mr. Bornstein said he and Mr. Flannery have worked closely for more than 20 years and have a similar view in terms of return and capital allocation. "]

["Heard on the Street", "The good news in the numbers was wages. Average hourly earnings were up 2.5% in December versus a year earlier, hewing to a trend that has been in place for over two years. But December 2016 was a strong month, meaning last month needed to be strong to match that pace. On a monthly basis, hourly earnings gained 0.3% in December from a month earlier, on the high end of recent monthly gains. Wages increased just 0.1% in November. There is good evidence that January will be relatively strong too. The corporate tax cut is giving businesses more wherewithal to compete with each other for workers: \u00a0In a recent report, Strategas Research listed 79 U.S. companies that \u00a0publicly announced they were giving out bonuses, increasing wages or taking other employee-friendly steps since the tax cut passed into law. And minimum-wage levels were just boosted in several big states, including California and New York. If the start of the year is strong, wage gains could soon approach 3% compared to a year earlier. Higher wages would start to solve one of the riddles about the economy since unemployment reached low levels. More cash for workers could boost consumer spending and make a slight dent in income inequality. Stronger wage growth is exactly what Federal Reserve policy makers want. If it comes they will be emboldened to keep raising rates this year, perhaps by more than the three increases they have penciled in."]
["Heard on the Street", "For companies, it would be more of a mixed bag: On the one hand, they would need to pay workers more; on the other, they are getting a windfall from tax cuts and workers with more cash may mean better sales. For investors, a combination of higher rates and rising labor costs could be challenging, but it would probably be better than the alternatives.

The fall term of 10th grade is a key time to make changes that can put a family in the optimal position to get financial aid. The reason: Families now fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, the form used to determine grants, loans and other forms of federal aid, based on their \u201cprior-prior year\u201d income. That means high-school sophomores who graduate in 2020 will use 2018 as the base year in reporting family and student income on their first Fafsa."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "\u201cStarting Jan. 1, families of high-school sophomores will need to be more careful,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com, a website that connects students with colleges and financial aid. With that in mind, here\u2019s a look at some financial steps parents of high-school sophomores can take before the end of 2017 and some they should defer until after Jan. 1.  One caveat: Families should check with a financial adviser and accountant to understand how these financial moves could affect their taxes, because they may run contrary to traditional tax-planning strategies.  Since your 2017 income won\u2019t appear on the Fafsa, any additional income you can shift from 2018 into 2017 may help you qualify for more aid. If possible, ask to receive any year-end bonus by Dec. 31.  If you have to withdraw funds from your retirement account, from a financial-aid perspective, it\u2019s better to do so this year. (However, you generally must take required minimum distributions from a retirement account annually if you are 70\u00bd or older or face big penalties.) If you\u2019re thinking about converting a traditional individual retirement account into a Roth IRA, a move that increases taxable income, try to do it before year-end, Mr. Kantrowitz says.  Meanwhile, individuals planning on taking an unpaid leave of absence from work should delay it until 2018, if possible, he adds. "]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "With the extended bull market, families may have sizable gains in their brokerage accounts. From a financial-aid standpoint, it\u2019s best for parents of high-school sophomores to take those gains now, says Mr. Kantrowitz. The Fafsa adds a family\u2019s adjusted gross income to untaxed income and benefits to yield total income, which is then used in the formula. If you need to take gains next year, aim to offset them with losses so the impact on any financial aid isn\u2019t as damaging, he adds. Families already planning on making a large purchase, such as a car, should try to do so before filing the Fafsa. The same goes for any costly home-improvement expenses, such as replacing an air-conditioning and heating system or a roof. Using cash on hand for those expenses will reduce a family\u2019s reportable assets on the Fafsa, says Deborah Fox, founder of Fox College Funding LLC. There\u2019s no benefit to having debt, as far as the Fafsa is concerned. But cash in the bank counts against you, so use some of that money to pay down debt before applying for aid, Mr. Kantrowitz says. One thing to keep in mind: The Fafsa allows parents to shelter roughly $20,000 to $35,000 in assets from being considered part of their expected family contribution.  For financial-aid purposes, it\u2019s generally best to save in the parent\u2019s name, not the child\u2019s, says Mr. Kantrowitz, since the Fafsa weighs assets in the child\u2019s name far more heavily than those in the parent\u2019s name. Parent assets are assessed at a maximum 5.64% rate, while student assets are assessed at a 20% flat rate. "]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "To that end, parents should consider converting any certificates of deposit or savings in the child\u2019s name to a 529 college-savings plan this year, he says. Many plans have low-risk investment options for people concerned about putting those funds at the mercy of a market downturn with only a few years left until the tuition bill comes due. But don\u2019t use a grandparent-owned 529, as it has a harsh impact on eligibility for need-based aid. While grandparent-owned 529s aren\u2019t reported as assets on the Fafsa, distributions count as untaxed income to the beneficiary, which can reduce aid eligibility by as much as half of the distribution amount, Mr. Kantrowitz says.  Another option: Use some savings to boost contributions to a qualified retirement account this year. Money in a qualified account, such as a 401(k), IRA and Roth IRA, isn\u2019t counted as an asset for students or parents. If the child earned money from a part-time or summer job this year, consider opening a Roth IRA in his or her name. However, contributions to and distributions from a retirement plan are reported as income on the Fafsa for the year they\u2019re made. So using this strategy is ineffective unless you wait to make a contribution or take a distribution until it will no longer affect aid eligibility, Mr. Kantrowitz says.

["World News", "Wednesday\u2019s news came as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Mr. Trump plans to deliver a tough message that Europe needs to increase its military spending at Thursday\u2019s meeting of NATO leaders. Mr. Tillerson told reporters traveling on Air Force One that Mr. Trump \u201creally wants participating NATO members to step up and fully meet their obligations of the burden sharing.\u201d  Mr. Tillerson said the administration wants allies to reach the NATO goal of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense. While many allies consider the NATO spending guideline a rough goal, the Trump administration has been treating it as a firm requirement. \u201cI think you can expect the president to be very tough on them, saying, \u2018Look, the U.S. is spending 4%.

You need to make sure you\u2019re doing your share for your own security as well.\u201d Before Mr. Tillerson\u2019s remarks, the U.S. European Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Europe, outlined $4.8 billion in spending for next year, up from $3.4 billion this year. The plan is part of the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal unveiled this week. European Command said it would increase air defenses, enhance surveillance capabilities and position more weaponry in Europe for troops from the U.S. It also said it would boost anti-submarine warfare assets and rotate more Marines to Europe."]

NATO leaders will meet briefly on Thursday during a single dinner session. Officials said many subjects are likely to be raised by leaders during their four-minute speaking slots. NATO is expected to unveil military spending agreements Thursday that will include European commitments to boost funding for military capabilities that NATO has identified as critical. The alliance also is preparing to increase its counterterrorism work, including expanding its support for the anti-Islamic State coalition and its training of partner militaries fighting terror groups."]
["World News", "Wednesday afternoon alliance ambassadors formally approved NATO\u2019s joining the anti-Islamic State coalition as a full member, a move pushed by the U.S. The agreement will allow NATO to take a more active role in the coalition, sharing more intelligence and expanding the role its AWACS planes play in the skies over Turkey. NATO officials said while it could pave the way for more training missions, the move wouldn\u2019t result in the alliance\u2019s taking a combat role in Syria or Iraq. Ahead of the decision by NATO ambassadors, Mr. Tillerson said he thought they would come around and the terror attack in Manchester would strengthen the resolve of NATO allies. France had been blocking NATO joining the coalition. A European diplomat said the French remained skeptical of the move, seeing it as more symbolic than practical, but didn\u2019t want to block an initiative important to the U.S. NATO reached agreement over long negotiations as senior alliance officials argued that the move would have practical benefits and Middle East nations told allies they wouldn\u2019t object.  European diplomats said that France was the last country to agree in part because of the change in government. It took time, officials said, for Mr. Macron\u2019s new administration to review the details and decide to approve the move.  Also at issue is funding for counterterrorism training. France remains skeptical of using common NATO funding for more counterterrorism training operations and believed that the move to join the anti-Islamic State coalition could force allies to take on more costs. The agreement reached Wednesday largely pushes off discussions on counterterrorism funding. "]
["World News", "Mr. Trump is due to have lunch Thursday with French President Emmanuel Macron.

The vote marked the first time a vice president broke a tie to confirm a cabinet secretary, Senate officials said. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Mrs. DeVos, a 59-year-old billionaire from Michigan, has spent decades as a leader and funder of the \u201cschool choice\u201d movement, which advocates charters and privately run schools as alternatives to low-performing traditional public schools. She has said students should be able to attend better-performing schools outside of their assigned districts and that tax dollars shouldn\u2019t be limited to traditional public schools. Her nomination became a flashpoint in a long debate over how best to improve U.S. education. Charters, which reduce the role of teachers unions, have grown rapidly in recent years in urban school districts, while overall enrollment in traditional school districts has declined.  \u201cOur children\u2019s futures should not be determined by their ZIP Code,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cStudents should not be trapped in a system that puts the status quo ahead of a child\u2019s success.\u201d  Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news. President Donald Trump campaigned on school choice, saying public schools should face competition. But his choice for education secretary sparked the built-in, grass-roots movement of public teachers and many parents, who were ready to push back with phone calls, letters and social media posts. \u201cThere\u2019s never been an education secretary who has been overtly hostile to public education,\u201d said Randi Weingarten,  head of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest unions."]
["Politics and Policy", "Tuesday\u2019s vote capped weeks of high drama highlighted by Mrs. DeVos\u2019s mid-January confirmation hearing. She appeared to stumble during the hearing, saying she may have been confused about a federal law to help students with disabilities, and at one point suggested that guns might be needed in some schools to guard against the threat of grizzly bears. She also refused to say whether she believed in equal accountability standards for traditional schools and alternatives. Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) was contacted more than 100,000 times by people opposing her, Democrats said. Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.) said his office was so busy dealing with opponents that he helped aides answer phones. Sen. Collins said she voted against Mrs. DeVos because she was troubled by what she viewed as her lack of familiarity with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Sen. Murkowski had said thousands of Alaskans had called, emailed and shown up in person to express their concern about a lack of experience with public education. The DeVos family\u2019s long history of donating to conservative causes\u2014including campaign contributions to senators who voted for her confirmation Tuesday\u2014and potential conflicts of interest due to her family\u2019s Amway Corp. wealth also drew public criticism. Betsy DeVos, center, leaving her Senate confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in January.Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images On Capitol Hill, Republicans worried over the DeVos vote had begged for more support from the White House, with little success. At a closed meeting with White House adviser Kellyeanne Conway on Monday, GOP aides asked Ms. Conway, \u201cWhere is the air cover?\u201d according to aides at the meeting."]
["Politics and Policy", "On Twitter, Mr. Trump focused instead on complaining about the media, publicizing his interview with a Fox News host and saying that the courts needed to act to help his efforts to protect the nation from terrorism. It wasn\u2019t until 8 a.m. Tuesday that the @POTUS account tweeted, \u201cSenate Dems protest to keep the failed status quo. Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!\u201d With Mrs. DeVos at risk of becoming the first cabinet pick in 28 years to be rejected, Republicans had to move the vote up in the Senate agenda. That allowed attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) to vote yes before facing his own confirmation vote. Mrs. DeVos was also helped by a rule change implemented by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) in 2013 that made it easier for cabinet picks to win confirmation. That change removed the \u201cfilibuster\u201d option for such picks, effectively lowering the threshold for passage from 60 votes to 50. Democrats, finding themselves with limited ability to block Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, have used procedural tools to delay votes on his cabinet picks. They spoke against Mrs. DeVos on the Senate floor throughout Monday night and Tuesday morning, attempting to attract the single vote they needed to kill her nomination. Throngs of people filled the public galleries that ring the Senate chamber Tuesday to witness the vote."]
["Politics and Policy", "The confirmation of Mrs. DeVos represented a victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who, after the vote, strode from the Senate floor into the hallway and in front of a dozen cameras gave a thumbs-up gesture. But the vote risks a public backlash for some Republicans up for re-election in 2018, including Sen. Deb Fischer (R., Neb.), whose Nebraska offices were hit with protests over the weekend regarding the DeVos vote. Asked whether supporting Mrs. DeVos was a tough vote, Sen. Fischer said, \u201cNot at all.\u201d She said she wasn\u2019t worried that federal funds for traditional public schools would get diverted to other schools. \u201cEducation is a state and local responsibility, and that\u2019s what we do in Nebraska,\u201d she said. Until now, the debate over \u201cschool choice\u201d has taken place largely at the state and local level, but the confirmation of Mrs. DeVos could portend bigger fights in Washington. The federal government provides just over 10% of all spending on K-12 education, according to the think tank New America. But there are big variations, with states that have higher poverty levels relying more on federal funding. Mississippi receives nearly 18% of its education funding from the federal government. Big school districts, such as in Los Angeles and Dallas, have lost millions due to charter-school growth, according to school officials. When a student attends a charter school, taxpayer dollars earmarked to educate that student flow to the charter instead of the school district. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Charter schools are the fastest-growing educational option in the U.S. Enrollment in charters grew 219% from 2004 to 2014, to more than 2.5 million students, while school-district enrollment dropped by 1%, according to an analysis of the latest information from the National Center for Education Statistics. Mrs. DeVos may have more influence over higher-education policy, some education experts say. The federal government distributes roughly $150 billion annually in loans and grants for college and graduate students. Its student-loan portfolio now totals about $1.3 trillion. But millions of borrowers are failing to make loan payments, putting taxpayers at risk.  One question facing the incoming secretary will be new regulations implemented by the Obama administration that threaten the closure of many for-profit college programs that leave students with high debt burdens relative to their incomes. Mrs. DeVos hasn\u2019t said whether she would roll back the regulations, as some congressional Republicans have pushed.

The Saudi-led military coalition that has been at war with the Houthis in Yemen for more than 2\u00bd years \u201cconsiders this a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime and could rise to be considered as an act of war against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u201d according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency."]
["Middle East News", "Debris from the missile showed it was made in Iran, the statement said, adding that the coalition \u201creserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner, in accordance with international law and based on the right of self-defense.\u201d Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari,  the commander of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, dismissed the claim. \u201cWe are not basically capable of transferring missiles to Yemen,\u201d he said Sunday, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Houthi missiles, he said, are homegrown. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, on Monday called Saudi accusations against Iran \u201cunfair, irresponsible, destructive and provocative,\u201d according to a state television news website. He advised the kingdom to stop its assault on Yemen to pave the way for peace talks. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that Saudi Arabia was bombing Yemen and killing thousands of innocent people and spreading famine. The kingdom \u201cis engaged in wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior and risky provocations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt blames Iran for the consequences.\u201d Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir tweeted that Iranian intervention in the region was undermining security and repeated that Saudi Arabia had the right to respond. The Houthis, who in the past have presented missiles as domestically sourced, have fired dozens at Saudi Arabia since the coalition began a campaign to oust them from Yemen\u2019s capital, San\u2019a, in 2015.  The range of some, like the \u201cVolcano H2\u201d the group fired Saturday, has increased markedly in 2017, putting significant Saudi population centers and energy infrastructure within range."]
["Middle East News", "Saudi Arabia, which controls Yemeni airspace and oversees shipping traffic through its ports, said all land, sea and air borders with the country would be closed temporarily to address the missile threat, although humanitarian supplies would still be allowed in. Tensions between Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni Muslim power in the region, and Iran, its main Shiite rival, have risen in recent days. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri,  a close Saudi ally, resigned Saturday, blaming Iran for destabilizing the region and saying his life was under threat. Saudi Arabia has more aggressively confronted Iran under 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who orchestrated Saudi involvement in Yemen.  Prince Mohammed, named next in line to the throne in June, has sought to consolidate power in recent days, arresting numerous high-ranking officials and businessmen on corruption charges. He is widely thought to be preparing to take over from his 81-year-old father, King Salman.

It would align the interests of lawmakers and their staffers with the interests of voters. Congress is essentially unaffected by the high costs of the ObamaCare exchanges because of a special exemption crafted under the Obama administration. The Affordable Care Act required members of Congress and their employees to participate in the health-insurance exchanges it established. They should have lost the generous coverage they had in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and instead bought one of the government-mandated options offered on the ACA exchanges. "]
["Commentary (U.S.)", "In late 2012, staffers and members figured out what was about to happen and begged the Obama administration for relief. Just as Congress was going into its August recess in 2013, the Office of Personnel Management ratified the fiction that the House and Senate each have fewer than 50 employees, and thus qualify as \u201csmall businesses.\u201d That enabled OPM to establish a system of special subsidies and exemptions, sparing Congress the embarrassment of a self-serving vote. Many staffers are exempted and allowed to remain on their old insurance plans. Members of Congress and their designated \u201cofficial office\u201d staff are insured through the District of Columbia\u2019s small business exchange\u2014but they receive a one-of-a-kind subsidy from their employer (taxpayers) of up to $12,000, or about 70% of their premiums.  All that would be illegal for anyone else. In fact, it\u2019s illegal for Congress too. But since it was established administratively, it can be ended the same way. The president should announce that he is instructing OPM to end the exemption and subsidies for Congress.  This is smart politics. One poll found 94% of voters opposed the special deal for Congress. It would also lead to smart policy: Any continued failure to reform health care means members of Congress and their staff would suffer under the current system. If the president does this, he\u2019d have huge negotiating leverage. He would align the interests of the ruling class with those of his voters, forcing Congress to act. He might even get some Democratic votes."]

["Technology", " Legislators, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies now are considering rules to protect the privacy of users of social networks like Facebook. While those efforts remain in the early stages, even tech companies say privately they expect some regulation to happen down the road. Yet some law-enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and national-security advocates point to a trade-off, noting that too much privacy can be as bad as too little. Bad actors take advantage of both extremes, abusing access to individuals on networks that are too open or freely conspiring on systems that are too closed. Law-enforcement agencies rely on access to user data as an important tool for tracking criminals or preventing terrorist attacks. As such, they have long argued additional regulation may be harmful to national security. Telegram is an example of a service offering users complete security. Encrypted from end to end, domiciled in a country out of reach of subpoenas\u2014and very easy to use\u2014the app is among the top choices of people worried about snooping governments and malicious third parties. Telegram\u2019s reputation has been a double-edged sword. Facebook's current data crisis involving Cambridge Analytica has angered users and prompted government investigations. To understand what's happening now, you have to look back at Facebook's old policies from 2007 to 2014. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains. Illustration: Laura Kammerman Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, said such apps are a big concern for law enforcement. \u201cThis is perfect for terrorist groups that want to network, propagate their message and recruit new members,\u201d he said."]
["Technology", "Telegram is popular in countries like Iran, where it was instrumental in helping the population organize the wave of antigovernment protests that swept across the country in early January. But it also has become known as the app of choice for Islamic State and other extremist groups, after U.S.-based tech companies like Twitter Inc. began cooperating with government agencies, removing accounts and content that promoted violence. Governments have little recourse. Iran blocked Telegram during government protests earlier this year, and Russia is threatening to block it unless it turns over user data.  Mr. Watts, who previously worked as an FBI special agent on a counterterrorism task force, said law-enforcement agencies need to invest a lot more in human intelligence and undercover investigators to penetrate secure online spaces. Some U.S. firms are already adapting to fears of new regulation and offering even greater security than Telegram. Signal, in San Francisco, is emerging as one of the more successful examples. It says it deletes all user information once it is no longer necessary for communication, making it impossible to comply with demands for users\u2019 personal data. That would make Signal more secure than, for example, WhatsApp, the popular encrypted messaging service, which Facebook bought in 2014 and that stores information such as with whom users are communicating and when. \u201cWhen we receive a subpoena for user data,\u201d Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike posted on the company\u2019s website, we \u201chave nothing to send back but a blank sheet of paper.\u201d"]
["Technology", "Observers warn the #deletefacebook movement will drive more users to these secure systems. Telegram\u2019s founder, the Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov,  said the firm recorded 200 million active users in March, a 70% increase on the year. \u201cWe don\u2019t do deals with marketers, data miners or government agencies,\u201d he wrote in the post on Wednesday. \u201cFor us Telegram is an Idea: it is the idea that everyone on this planet has a right to be free.\u201d Mr. Durov has relocated the company several times since leaving Russia, where it faces a court order to turn over encryption keys to the intelligence services. It is now based in the United Arab Emirates. Telegram\u2019s terms are simple: No calls to violence, porn or copyright infringement on public channels. The app can\u2019t take action on private channels because all private content is encrypted and largely inaccessible even to the company.

A Congressional Budget Office analysis released Monday found that the proposed American Health Care Act would cause 14 million Americans to lose insurance coverage by 2018 and 24 million over the next 10 years. The brunt of that reduction would come from rolling back Medicaid spending. The attendant reduction in health spending would lower budget deficits by $337 billion, the agency found, while average premiums for individuals on public exchanges are likely to rise by 15 to 20% in the short term as the individual mandate penalties are repealed. Those estimates will make the bill as presently constructed a tough sell in Washington. Granted, actual policy experience is bound to differ from CBO estimates, and the positive effects on the budget will likely pacify some conservatives who had opposed the bill."]
["Heard on the Street", "But the Republican majority in the Senate is thin, and several Republican senators have expressed concern over proposed cuts to Medicaid spending. The prospect of 14 million Americans losing insurance in a midterm election year can\u2019t be comforting to politicians who will soon face the voters. However, that means a bill which would harm large swaths of the industry\u2014Medicaid spending curbs would hurt certain health insurers, hospitals, and drug companies which count Medicaid as a major customer\u2014is more likely to get a retooling. That ought to give investors some comfort. Changes to the bill that could win over skeptical politicians would also likely work in favor of companies currently facing significant risks to their business. With equity valuations already high and therefore vulnerable across the industry, pushback on the AHCA is something investors should want to see. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

For the past week or so, delegates to China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress have droned about government policy, stopping occasionally to field prearranged questions. Then came the drama of the two reporters, one in red, one in blue. Eye-roll emoji. Midway through a news briefing Tuesday, the blue-clad reporter had enough. A fellow journalist in a red jacket beside her was asking how Beijing would keep tabs on overseas investment under President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt-and-Road infrastructure program. Her query meandered. \u201cThe transformation of the role of state-assets supervision, centered on capital management, is currently a subject of widespread concern,\u201d she said, then kept talking. The clock ticked.  Disdain appeared to creep across the face of the woman in blue as she listened to the roughly-45-second softball."]
["A-hed", "When the woman in red finally got around to her main question, the woman in blue had raised a fist to her chin and furrowed her eyebrows. She cast sideways glances at the speaker and around her. Then, with a toss of the head, she executed an eye-roll to make Miley Cyrus proud. For viewers, it was a rare flash of unscripted emotion amid stage-managed tedium. \u201cIt was like she was expressing frustration on behalf of the rest of us\u201d over the scripted nature of the event, says Zhang Lifan,  a Beiijng-based independent historian who has written critically about the government. A meme was born, setting phones vibrating around China. Online, people divided into red and blue camps\u2014mostly blue. Animated images of Ms. Blue\u2019s expressions exploded on the\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nWeChat\n            \n      messaging app. T-shirts and mobile-phone covers with images of the eye-roll went on sale on Alibaba\u2019s Taobao platform. Ms. Red identified herself as Zhang Huijun,  a journalist with American Multimedia Television USA, a little-known, Los Angeles-based channel whose website says it has worked with state broadcaster China Central Television on programming. The policy she asked about was typical congress fare. The Belt-and-Road initiative is part of Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of Chinese global leadership, involving pledges to build infrastructure and trade links between Asia and Europe."]
["A-hed", "The eye-roller, Liang Xiangyi,  a television reporter for Shanghai-based Yicai Media Group, emerged as a kind of folk hero for those tired of the turgid pageantry. \u201cNo one really cares about these sessions\u2014not even the journalists themselves,\u201d says Mr. Zhang, the historian. \u201cSo people will just pay attention to any interesting sideshow.\u201d Efforts to reach Ms. Liang and Ms. Zhang weren\u2019t successful. A senior Yicai editor declined to comment Wednesday morning. AMTV didn\u2019t respond to emailed inquiries. A U.S.-based employee who answered the phone at AMTV declined to comment.  Some social-media users declared their \u201cblue\u201d sympathies. Others deemed Ms. Liang\u2019s reaction inappropriate. Online were photos depicting the standoff\u2014side-by-side pictures of red Coke and blue Pepsi cans, food-delivery drivers with red and blue boxes, strawberry-blueberry juxtapositions. Among the memes were composites like this one of blueberries and strawberries to represent blue and red camps.Illustration: iStock (2) One commenter mixed images of the women with photos of clashing soccer players in red and blue jerseys, saying: \u201cWhen red meets blue, there will always be discord.\u201d A Tuesday column on Chinese online-media firm\n            Sina\n Corp.\u2019s\n      technology news portal attempted to explain why people roll their eyes: \u201cHuman eyes feature more white areas than those of other primates, therefore we have a special ability to communicate through eyeball rotation.\u201d"]
["A-hed", "Some of Ms. Liang\u2019s fans expressed worry she would be punished for upstaging the news briefing. Qin Weiping, a Washington-based current-affairs commentator who often criticizes China\u2019s government, tweeted an offer to hire Ms. Liang as a guest host on his YouTube talk show if she were to lose her job over the incident. Ms. Liang \u201cwas like an innocent child who blurted out that the emperor has no clothes,\u201d Mr. Qin says, adding that the incident allowed \u201cordinary people with no opportunity to participate in politics to express their scorn and discontent in a roundabout way.\u201d The National People\u2019s Congress press center said it didn\u2019t revoke Ms. Liang\u2019s accreditation to cover the event. It didn\u2019t respond to other queries about the eye-rolling incident. In a setting where every effort is made to avoid embarrassment, not to mention sarcasm, the eye-roll was a jarring departure. Beijing likes using reporters as props during political events, says Francesco Sisci,  who has covered China\u2019s annual legislative session for decades for Italian newspapers. Every year, he notes, state media trumpets the number of foreign correspondents in attendance.  \u201cIt\u2019s like China is more and more important,\u201d says Mr. Sisci, who wasn\u2019t at the eye-rolling event, \u201cbecause they\u2019re all paying attention.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s excitement followed a different outbreak of enthusiasm during October\u2019s Communist Party congress, when users of a free phone game competed to \u201cclap\u201d for Mr. Xi. It generated more than 1 billion claps. Journalists gather for the National People\u2019s Congress.Photo: Wang Jianhua/Xinhua/ZUMA Press"]

Spoof videos surfaced featuring men and women re-enacting the scene. On Zhihu, a question-and-answer website, a user solicited tips on how to eye-roll like Ms. Liang. Someone replied: \u201cStart by looking at the other person\u2019s shoes, size up the person from bottom to top, and add sounds such as \u2018tsk\u2019 or \u2018humph\u2019 for the best effect.\u201d The discussion later disappeared from the website. A Zhihu official didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

["Politics and Policy", "Early signs have been largely reassuring to business leaders and trade partners, who have worried that the president\u2019s demands would uproot rules that are by now embedded in the continent\u2019s commercial ecosystem. They say there is much they all can embrace in the Trump proposals, some of which borrow from the Obama-era Pacific trade deal that Mr. Trump killed on his first full day in office. \u201cWhile there are tough issues here for the other countries, I don\u2019t see any obvious poison pills,\u201d William Reinsch, a former Clinton administration trade official who has run a free-trade advocacy group for 15 years, wrote in a recent essay. President Donald Trump spoke about renegotiating Nafta at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June 21. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images The question is whether U.S. negotiators can extract enough concessions from Mexico and Canada so that Mr. Trump can declare victory to his factory-worker base without upsetting his business backers, who have lobbied intensively to preserve the agreement.  Few think that will be an easy needle to thread. The U.S. has floated some proposals tinged with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy that the two Nafta partners and many U.S. multinationals say they can\u2019t accept. Those include a demand to give the U.S. more freedom to unilaterally restrict cross-border trade if it thinks foreign firms are cheating, and to tighten barriers against cheap imports from outside the region."]
["Politics and Policy", "And while Mr. Trump has agreed to renegotiate Nafta rather than pull out\u2014as he came close to doing in April\u2014he repeatedly says he is keeping that option open if he\u2019s unhappy with how the talks unfold. \u201cNafta\u2019s a horrible deal for the United States,\u201d the president told The Wall Street Journal in a July 25 interview. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a renegotiation right now so we\u2019ll see,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have to terminate it.\u201d Mexico and Canada are entering the negotiations mainly playing defense, making few demands other than to try to protect and modernize an agreement that has generally been more popular in those countries than in the U.S. \u201cOur first goal is to keep the deal in place,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Kalach, a textile businessman who leads a Mexican private-sector campaign to defend Nafta in the U.S. \u201cOur second goal is, don\u2019t destroy the value chains that have led to so much growth over the last two decades.\u201d  The partners have set an ambitious timetable, saying they hope to wrap up talks by early next year, ahead of Mexican and U.S. elections that could complicate ratification of a new agreement. This week\u2019s opening round of negotiations runs through Sunday; the second round kicks off in Mexico in early September. Many businesses across the continent are hoping for a quick resolution."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cJust the mention of Nafta and renegotiating in the same sentence has had an impact,\u201d said Daniel Winkowitsch, who oversees international sales for Tri-States Grain Conditioning, a Spirit Lake, Iowa, maker of temperature-monitoring devices for crop silos. Tri-States\u2019 sales to Mexico, which grew as U.S. food companies expanded there, fell by nearly 75% over the first six months of 2017 versus last year because of questions over U.S. trade policy, Mr. Winkowitsch said. In seeking to overhaul Nafta, the Trump administration wants to remake a pact that has done much to transform a region covering one-fourth of the world economy and, according to backers, made the hemisphere more competitive against rivals in Asia and Europe. Since the agreement took effect in 1994, trade and investment between the countries has soared. The U.S. has gone from running a small goods surplus with Mexico before Nafta of about $2 billion to a $63.2 billion deficit last year. Shown, a crane transported vehicles on a container ship in Oakland, Calif., on July 13.Photo: Ben Margot/Associated Press \u201cMexico and the U.S. are like a scrambled egg: There is no way anymore you can separate the white and the yolk,\u201d said Juan Pablo del Valle, chairman of petrochemical giant Mexichem, one of Mexico\u2019s largest public companies. It exports fluorspar and other raw materials from Mexico to its U.S. manufacturing plant in Louisiana, where it produces refrigerants used in the auto industry. The company, in turn, imports ethylene gas from the U.S. to feed its Mexico plants."]
["Politics and Policy", "Yet making North American multinationals more efficient has cost U.S. workers their jobs, according to many labor unions, by making it easier for manufacturers to shift production to lower-cost Mexico. Mr. Trump picked up that complaint in his 2016 campaign and made Nafta the focus of his attacks on a quarter-century of bipartisan establishment support for globalization\u2014an era that began with Nafta as the first major trade pact between developed and developing countries. But in his first months in office, the president has struggled to translate these messages into policy. In April, he ordered a study of how to curb steel and aluminum imports, giving aides a June deadline to craft a plan. That is now on hold. In late April, the president was on the verge of dropping out of Nafta and celebrating the move at a Pennsylvania rally as one of the chief accomplishments of his first 100 days in office. He pulled back at the last minute, after cabinet members argued the abrupt move could cause severe economic disruptions, and pleas from his Mexican and Canadian counterparts. Instead, the three countries agreed to the renegotiation that begins this week.

["Politics and Policy", "President Trump\u2019s election and his Nafta-withdrawal threats have also chastened free traders in the business community and highlighted a political problem of their cause: their failure to make free trade, and Nafta specifically, work better for average Americans\u2014or at least persuade them that it does.  The Nafta talks are a chance to fix it. In the past six months, a frenzy of public relations and lobbying among Nafta defenders has sought to recast the debate\u2014inside the Trump administration, on Capitol Hill and among the American electorate. Mexico\u2019s main trade group has had more than 120 meetings with U.S. policy makers over the past nine months, including 20 governors and more than 50 members of Congress. Canadian officials established a war-room-like operation and assigned specific cabinet ministers to business leaders, mayors and lawmakers in different U.S. states, with a focus on local regions where U.S. jobs are dependent on trade with Canada and Canadian investment. Influential U.S. lawmakers have weighed in, especially from border states and agricultural districts that were big Nafta winners, demanding the Trump administration tread gently in the talks. At a June congressional hearing, Rep. Kenny Marchant (R., Texas) cited booming Canadian traffic at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport and told Mr. Trump\u2019s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, that those gaining from it \u201care uneasy about the upcoming negotiations.\u201d All of that pressure has persuaded Trump aides, if not the president himself, to acknowledge Nafta\u2019s benefits and the disruptions that could result for continent-wide supply chains built around Nafta\u2019s rules. In response to Mr. Marchant, Mr. Lighthizer said, \u201cOur objective is to, first of all, do no harm,\u201d a phrase he repeated three times in the hearing."]
["Politics and Policy", "When the administration released its official negotiating objectives, Canada, Mexico and big business said there was much they could accept. Indeed, they already had accepted many of the objectives last year, as part of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership spearheaded by President Barack Obama and killed by President Trump. Those provisions covered digital commerce, which didn\u2019t exist when Nafta was created, and stricter labor and environmental standards. But the Trump objectives also include nods to the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d goals, drawing concern from the other countries. Those include proposals to scrap a special panel for settling tariff disputes among Nafta members and to tighten rules on how much of a manufactured product needs to come from inside Nafta to qualify for duty-free trade. A key question is how hard Mr. Trump will push his team\u2019s first objective: to \u201cimprove the trade balance and reduce the trade deficit with the Nafta countries.\u201d Mr. Trump complains that the U.S. has gone from running a small goods surplus with Mexico before Nafta of about $2 billion, to a $63.2 billion deficit last year. Free-trade advocates say it would be impossible to reverse that trend\u2014driven by economic factors as much as by trade policies\u2014in the talks, and it could be destructive to the region\u2019s economy to try. \u201cThe potential for a breakdown in talks derives chiefly from the frequently expressed desire of President Trump and some of his associates to use the Nafta renegotiation to reduce the bilateral U.S. trade deficit with Mexico,\u201d the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an influential pro-globalization think tank, wrote in a recent report."]

["Politics and Policy", "The comments risk complicating Republican efforts to present a united front on both the Senate and House versions of the tax bill to keep it on track. Publicly, the president has praised the House plan, but his comments could fuel doubts among lawmakers about how wedded he is to that version. Many GOP lawmakers in competitive districts already have concerns about supporting the bill, and could balk at being asked to cast a politically risky vote on a plan that may never become law. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the president\u2019s bill,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) about the House tax bill, speaking after the meeting.

The details weren\u2019t locked in as of late Wednesday.  The GOP is eager to avoid a replay of the failure of Congress to get a health-care overhaul bill to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk. Earlier this year, the House passed a bill but the Senate failed on several different attempts to follow suit."]
["Politics and Policy", "During the meeting Tuesday, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn echoed Mr. Trump, these people said, leaving attendees with the impression that the White House isn\u2019t as invested in the legislation being considered this week by the House Ways and Means Committee as it may be in the Senate tax package, which hasn\u2019t been released. \u201cDon\u2019t get too hung up on the House bill,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, according to two people in the room.  Asked about Mr. Cohn\u2019s remark, a White House official said that he was simply urging senators who are harping on concerns about the House bill to focus on their own legislation. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Your bill doesn\u2019t exist yet. don\u2019t get hung up on what you don\u2019t like about their bill and sink the entire process,\u2019\u201d the official said. The official said the president\u2019s comment was \u201cmeant in the same way\u201d as Mr. Cohn\u2019s comment and shouldn\u2019t be seen as a sign he doesn\u2019t support the House version of the bill. Mr. Manchin convened the meeting with Mr. Cohn and Marc Short,  the White House legislative affairs director, at the Library of Congress. A dozen Democratic lawmakers\u2014a mix of vulnerable senators from red states and other centrists\u2014attended. In his comments, according to people in the room, Mr. Cohn played down concerns about the House bill, which ranged from the impact on teachers from a\u00a0 scrapped deduction for classroom supplies, a matter raised by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.), to broader worries about the impact on manufacturing and the deficit, raised by Democratic Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware and Michael Bennet of Colorado, respectively."]
["Politics and Policy", "Shortly after the meeting began, Mr. Cohn stepped out of the room after receiving a call on his cellphone. When he returned minutes later, he announced that he had the president, then in Seoul, South Korea, on speaker phone.

Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were the strongest support he had shown to date for Mr. Moore in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct from several decades ago. Republicans have been divided over how to handle the accusations against their candidate in the Alabama special election to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. If\u00a0Mr. Moore loses, the GOP majority would narrow to just one seat, further limiting the party\u2019s ability to pass major legislation. Mr. Moore has denied the sexual-misconduct accusations.

In a statement last weekend, Delta said it supported the Second Amendment but decided to cut the discounts to reflect \u201cthe airline\u2019s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.\u201d Delta was one of several corporations including\n            Metlife\n Inc.\n      and\n            United Continental Holdings\n Inc.\u2019s\n      United Airlines to cut ties with the NRA after a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17.  Mr. Cagle\u2019s move follows criticism of Delta\u2019s decision from conservative Republican and tea-party groups, and calls to block the bill that includes the jet-fuel tax breaks, which is backed by Republican Gov. Nathan Deal. It also has created an awkward situation for two politicians who often work together: Mr. Deal, who is term-limited, and Mr. Cagle, who is trying to assert himself as a social conservative in advance of the Republican primary in May. Mr. Deal\u2019s chief of staff, Chris Riley, said in a message on Twitter that Mr. Deal assumed Delta\u2019s decision would include other political groups as well \u201cto remain neutral.\u201d "]
["U.S. News", "A Delta spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment, though last weekend Delta said it had taken similar actions in the past and \u201cwill not support organizations on any side of any highly charged political issue that divides our nation.\u201d Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School arrested for killing at least 17 students, has admitted to being the gunman, according to court records.

In Georgia, the battle is the latest within the GOP between a pro-business faction of the party and a social conservative wing. Social conservatives in the state have pressed for the passage of a \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill in the Legislature that is opposed by those who say it could lead to discrimination against gay people and others. Many corporations, including Delta, opposed such bills.  In 2015, the Legislature ended a decadelong tax break on jet fuel at Atlanta\u2019s airport, in part because of Delta\u2019s opposition to religious-liberty bills. In 2016, the Legislature passed a religious liberty bill, but Mr. Deal\u2014responding in part to pressure from corporations\u2014vetoed it. "]

["Heard on the Street", "The White House is expected to soon unveil new tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports, in addition to the $50 billion already proposed. China\u2019s ability to evenly match the U.S. on tariffs is limited, since it imports only about $130 billion in U.S. goods annually, much lower than the more than $500 billion the U.S. imports from China. But as the case with Qualcomm shows, China has other sources of leverage that it can bring to bear. Sales by U.S. companies\u2019 Chinese units were $356 billion in 2015 (the last year with available data), according to the Commerce Department. That was more than double the value of what the U.S. exported to China that year. China accounts for more than a third of total sales for semiconductor companies in the S&P 500, according to FactSet. The chip industry is especially exposed to trade tensions between the U.S. and China. U.S.-designed chips go into many of China\u2019s exports, but China has now made it a priority to build its own chip industry. Both countries consider protecting their semiconductor industries to be in their national interests. Investors have spent the past month worrying that U.S. chip makers could get caught in a trade war. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 6% since President Donald Trump announced the first tariffs on Chinese goods on March 22. That\u2019s by far the worst performance of other tech subsectors in that period, and lags behind the nearly 2% gain of the S&P 500."]
["Heard on the Street", "The trade troubles present U.S. chip companies with two major problems. The first is that regulatory actions will limit their ability to make acquisitions. Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise intervention in\n            Broadcom\n\u2019s\n      attempt to buy Qualcomm last month, and China\u2019s subsequent resistance to Qualcomm\u2019s efforts on NXP, show that deal making in the new environment will be fraught with additional risk. Second, the industry is extremely dependent on China. Sales of U.S. chips in China largely don\u2019t show up in trade statistics because they are manufactured overseas, where they are also consumed by manufacturers that use them in smartphones, computers, servers, cameras and other gadgets. But if chip companies are among the most vulnerable to actions by China, they are hardly alone. What has happened to Qualcomm should put plenty of companies on edge.

["Business", "Mr. Harrison, 72 years old, said he is completing an agreement to team up with Paul Hilal,  who left William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management LP to launch his own fund last year. They are expected to try to put Mr. Harrison in a senior management position at CSX, which CP approached about buying last year and in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Hilal\u2019s fund, Mantle Ridge LP, has raised more than $1 billion for a single investment, according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors have committed to locking up their money in the fund for five years, the person said. \u201cWe are close to a deal to potentially look at some opportunities,\u201d Mr. Harrison said in an interview. CSX shares rose 11% to $41.06 after hours. They closed down 3.2% Wednesday after the company released fourth-quarter results Tuesday. Mr. Harrison, the former CEO of Canadian National Railway Co., took the helm at CP in 2012 after Pershing Square waged a successful proxy fight to oust then-CEO Fred Green. Mr. Hilal personally recruited Mr. Harrison, and the two worked closely on CP\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to consolidate the industry, which has been battered by falling commodity prices and coal traffic. On Wednesday, Mr. Harrison announced he was retiring earlier than expected from CP and would forfeit C$118 million ($89 million) in compensation to pursue opportunities with other North American railroads. His most recent contract was extended to the end of June 2017, when he was expected to hand over the reins to President Keith Creel. Instead, he will leave at the end of this month."]
["Business", "An activist campaign at CSX could resemble Pershing Square\u2019s fight for control of CP, Canada\u2019s second-biggest railroad by revenue. The fund built a big stake in the Canadian railroad and argued it needed better management, floating Mr. Harrison as its CEO pick.  After a brutal proxy fight, Pershing Square won control of the board, including seats for Messrs. Ackman and Hilal, and installed Mr. Harrison as CEO. He went on to slash costs and improve the company\u2019s margins. Mr. Harrison began his career more than 50 years ago squirting oil under railcars. The blunt, demanding executive has attracted a loyal investor following for his detailed attention to cost-cutting and improved traffic times. During his tenure at CP, Mr. Harrison had special screens placed in his various homes in the U.S. so he could monitor train arrivals and departures. On some occasions when trains were behind schedule, Mr. Harrison called local engineers for an explanation. Under Mr. Harrison, CP approached both CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. about combining, touting its operational improvements. Mr. Hilal was instrumental in delivering that message, people familiar with the matter have said. Since Mr. Harrison joined CP, the railroad\u2019s operating ratio, a measure of operating costs as a percentage of revenue, fell to 58.6% in its most recent fiscal year from 81.3% at the end of 2011.  CSX\u2019s operating ratio in 2016 was 69.4%, and it has said it is targeting a ratio in the mid-60s longer-term."]

The pact deepened an alliance between OPEC, led by its top exporter, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, which produces more crude oil than any other country but isn\u2019t a member of the cartel. By keeping production at about 1.8 million barrels a day lower than late 2016\u2019s levels, the group is suppressing about 2% of global supply and aiming to put a floor under the price of oil."]
["Oil Markets", "But investors had been expecting deeper cuts. Oil prices fell about 4% Thursday after news of the deal spread, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, declining to $49.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and Brent, the global benchmark, falling to $51.92. A longer period of the same level of production disappointed investors in part because of the widely held expectation that U.S. shale will continue to ramp up, keeping supply high and dampening prices. \u201cWhat is needed is not time, what we need is volumes\u201d cut by OPEC to offset rising U.S. shale production, said Jamie Webster, a senior director at Boston Consulting Group. Many big banks have predicted that an extension of OPEC\u2019s cuts will help oil prices rise to about $60 a barrel by the end of 2017. Such a rise will boost OPEC\u2019s petrostates, but will also provide a cash infusion to U.S. shale firms, which have tapped Wall Street financing to keep pumping through the downturn, and would gain an even greater incentive to pump if prices rise. U.S. output is likely to hit a record high this year of 9.9 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2014almost the level at which Saudi Arabia has agreed to cap itself. That means U.S. shale may emerge as the deal\u2019s biggest beneficiary, a reality that highlights the pressure on the two massive players, Saudi Arabia and Russia, to extend their output agreement\u2014even though so far it hasn\u2019t significantly lifted prices or drained a global oversupply of petroleum."]
["Oil Markets", "Inaction would have risked sending the market into a tailspin. Both countries badly need higher oil prices. Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih insisted Thursday that the coalition\u2019s efforts are working and just need more time, and played down concerns about American producers taking market share. \u201cThe market in my opinion is on its way to recovery,\u201d he said in opening public remarks at the meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t see shale in anyway derailing what we are doing,\u201d Mr. Falih said. \u201cThe market is big enough to absorb the increased production of shale.\u201d Sitting next to the Saudi energy minister, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak hailed their cooperation as a \u201cnew era\u201d and suggested the spirit of the deal would extend to other arenas. \u201cThis is not just a question of stabilizing the oil market but much more,\u201d Mr. Novak said. Russia has been building deeper ties in the Middle East since it launched an air campaign to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,  allowing Qatar to buy a piece of its state oil company, Rosneft, and striking oil deals in Iraq and Libya. Mr. Novak denied that Russia\u2019s 2018 elections played a role in the deal. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s national budget gets over a third of its revenue from the energy industry. Mr. Falih also disputed that plans to take the kingdom\u2019s state oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. public in 2018 were a factor in the move to extend the deal. Its valuation will depend in part on oil prices."]
["Oil Markets", "OPEC\u2019s petrostates are normally loathe to hold back output, but their hand has been forced as low prices worsened economic crises in members like Nigeria and Venezuela. Even in the richest producers like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, governments have made painful cuts to popular social programs. Billions of dollars are at stake. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, OPEC members\u2019 net revenues from oil exports will rise by over $100 billion in 2017 if the production cuts are extended. With others joining the cartel, two dozen countries with output totaling over 50 million barrels of oil a day\u2014over half of world demand\u2014are working together. Such alliances have formed during past price downturns and have had short-term success. But they \u201ceventually fall apart,\u201d said Robert McNally, president of energy consultancy The Rapidan Group in Washington, D.C. And now, the group faces new competition from rising U.S. production. \u201cThe whole world stage has changed now with American shale,\u201d said Kirk Edwards, president of Latigo Petroleum, a closely held producer in Texas based in Odessa. That sector has proved more resilient than many expected when oil prices collapsed in 2014. Producers have made technological improvements that allow many of them to be profitable at less than $50 a barrel, and continue to find easy access to capital and backing from private-equity firms. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, oil minister for OPEC member Nigeria, acknowledged the cartel had a problem with shale. \u201cWe can\u2019t police them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t lock them up.\u201d"]

Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of ultrarich nominees has led to complications during the confirmation process and a mountain of work for the lawyers his designates have hired to navigate the rules.  \nExxon Mobil\n Corp.\nhad to cash out its former chief executive, Rex Tillerson,  with an $180 million retirement package and transfer his unvested shares into a trust so the secretary of state could make a clean break with the oil and gas firm and abide by ethics rules. The U.S. Senate panel considering Betsy DeVos,  Mr. Trump\u2019s billionaire nominee for secretary of education, delayed its vote after Democratic senators argued they didn\u2019t have enough time to review her lengthy ethics and disclosure paperwork, which listed 102 companies and investment vehicles she would need to divest to avoid conflicts of interest. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin,  a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood producer, faced criticism in a memo from Democratic staffers on the Senate Finance Committee for failing to disclose about $100 million in assets on his initial disclosure papers, an omission he attributed to a misunderstanding of the forms and called an unintentional oversight during his hearing. "]
["Politics and Policy", "The president himself has faced calls from ethics watchdog groups to sell his businesses or put them in a blind trust. Mr. Trump has refused, instead handing over his business operations to his older sons and a company executive, and argued he can\u2019t have a conflict of interest because U.S. law exempts the president from such rules governing federal employees.  Mr. Viola is the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to drop out of the running due to concerns about divesting his business interests. Because Mr. Viola actively owns multiple companies, the divestiture and disclosure process would likely have proven harder for him than for other nominees with family money or stockholdings. The Department of Defense also has particularly strict ethics rules for officials, including the secretary of the army, who are involved in the acquisitions process.  U.S. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis,  a spokesman for the Pentagon, said Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was disappointed by Mr. Viola\u2019s withdrawal but understood and respected the decision.  \u201cThe Secretary is confident that Mr. Viola will remain a stalwart supporter of America\u2019s soldiers,\u201d Capt. Davis said in a statement. \u201cThe Secretary will recommend to the President another candidate soon.\u201d  Mr. Viola graduated from West Point and served in the U.S. Army before becoming a Nymex trader and eventually building a vast electronic trading company now known as Virtu. The firm has a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion. The wealth has made Mr. Viola a billionaire, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index."]
["Politics and Policy", "But the business that Mr. Viola built up over 35 years\u2014which include interests in an airline in addition to the financial trading firm and hockey team\u2014proved difficult for the U.S. Army veteran to unwind in a way that would allow him to comply with ethics rules, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The legal team Mr. Viola hired in Washington to help him disengage from the businesses and comply with Defense Department rules couldn\u2019t find a way for him to navigate the situation without doing harm to the underlying companies, according to the person, who said the required moves could have resulted in people at his businesses losing their jobs. Mr. Trump\u2019s selections for the other two military-service chiefs are still awaiting confirmation.  He nominated Heather Wilson,  an Air Force veteran and former Republican congresswoman from New Mexico, as secretary of the air force and tapped private-equity investor Philip Bilden to become secretary of the navy.

["World News", "But the Treasury secretary, who will be making his first appearance on the global stage Friday at a gathering of the world\u2019s finance chiefs from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging economies, is facing a tough sell. Besides fears of unilateral sanctions sparking retaliation, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are set to strengthen the dollar, a key sore point for the administration. Failure to solve this currency conundrum could ratchet up global trade tensions. \u201cOur focus is creating economic growth that is good for the United States and for the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said after a meeting with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cIt is not our desire to get into trade wars, it is our desire to deal with where there is imbalance in certain trade relations,\u201d he said. Trump administration threats to level unilateral currency sanctions, vows to rewrite international trade deals and jabs at the World Trade Organization have spooked G-20 nations. Ahead of the G-20 meeting in the resort town of Baden-Baden, Germany, the International Monetary Fund warned that the U.S., China and other large economies risk derailing the global economy if leaders fail to fight a growing protectionist tide. But the Treasury secretary dismissed those concerns, saying the U.S. is one of the most open markets in the world. \u201cThe president is interested in making sure that our agreements are reciprocal,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants free and fair trade.\u201d"]
["World News", "Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, whose administration has criticized the Trump administration\u2019s trade rhetoric, sounded a note of optimism. Berlin is particularly concerned about the U.S. introducing a border-adjusted tax and the White House rolling back some financial regulations. \u201cWe won\u2019t solve all problems in Baden-Baden, but the process will continue in a constructive and positive way. That\u2019s a very good message,\u201d he said. But G-20 delegates were struggling late Thursday to hammer out a consensus on whether to accept a U.S. proposal to adopt a commitment to \u201cfree and fair trade,\u201d rather than past G-20 vows to avoid all forms of protectionism, an official from one of the countries said. The U.S. administration is facing a policy contradiction. Mr. Trump says he thinks the dollar is too strong while China\u2019s yuan and Germany\u2019s euro, in particular, are too weak, giving those countries an unfair trade advantage. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s key domestic economic proposals\u2014and rising interest rates in the U.S.\u2014are boosting the dollar\u2019s value. Failure to solve this contradiction could escalate global trade tensions. \u201cTrump faces an impossible combination of policies if he truly wants a weak dollar,\u201d said David Bloom, global head of currency research at global bank,\n            HSBC\n.\n      \u201cMost of his ideas point to a stronger dollar,\u201d he said, which will raise manufacturing costs and crimp demand for U.S. products overseas."]
["World News", "The Treasury Secretary tried Thursday to present a more moderate position than his boss, saying that while a strong dollar may cause the economy problems in the short term, in the long term, it is a sign of confidence in the world\u2019s currency reserve.  \u201cWhat I am focused on is the long-term aspects of the currency and the importance of it as a stable reserve currency around the world,\u201d he said. That is why Mr. Mnuchin will push finance ministers from China, Japan, Germany and other G-20 countries to abide by existing currency vows to not to use their exchange rates for competitive gains. Drafting plans to sanction countries that devalue their currencies, the Trump administration repeatedly has targeted China\u2019s yuan policy, accusing the country of keeping its exchange rate artificially low and driving a $350 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with the country. And Germany\u2019s record-breaking trade surplus, the largest in the world, has put it in U.S. sights also. \u201cWhat can I as German finance minister do to reduce the surplus?\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said Thursday. Economically struggling eurozone countries don\u2019t make an attractive destination for investors and need to overhaul their economies, Berlin says.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week said it is the dollar that is overvalued, not the euro that is undervalued. And China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang,  said Wednesday that Beijing wouldn\u2019t devalue its currency and didn\u2019t want a trade war."]
["World News", "\u201cThe administration is trying to pretend that if countries were to stop manipulating their currency, U.S. trade would move closer to balanced,\u201d said Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at\n            Citigroup\n Inc.\n      \u201cThe problem is the attractiveness of the U.S. as a place to put capital makes it hard to get that outcome.\u201d Still, many investors are betting the dollar will continue strengthening as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and the administration pursues corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Hedge funds and other speculative investors currently hold about $16 billion in bets on a rising dollar. Adding to Washington\u2019s currency challenges, if Beijing were to stop controlling the yuan\u2019s value right now, most economists say the country\u2019s weakening growth prospects would mean the exchange rate would plummet. The country has burned through $1 trillion propping up the yuan. \u201cThe U.S. doesn\u2019t want China to depeg now,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top U.S. Treasury official in the Obama administration. A \u201cfree float would see devaluation that could boost Chinese exports, widening the U.S. trade deficit.\u201d That is the exact opposite of what Mr. Trump says he wants. When China devalued its currency in August 2015, markets tumbled across the globe as investors feared the widespread repercussions of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy."]
["World News", "And too strong a dollar also could roil markets. Emerging economies have stocked up dollar-denominated debt, and a surge in the U.S. currency could trigger severe capital outflows from some of them. Since investors most likely would put their cash into U.S. assets, the dollar would rise further in a dangerous feedback loop. The International Monetary Fund, the world\u2019s currency cop, said last year the dollar was already 10% to 20% over the value market fundamentals warrant. Since then, the dollar has risen by 7% against a basket of currencies.

["Business", "Unilever made clear it didn\u2019t want to pursue a tie-up, but investors in recent years have encouraged the Anglo-Dutch maker of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Dove soap and Axe deodorant to sell underperforming businesses or do a large acquisition to boost its shareholder returns, which have lagged behind other European home and personal-care companies. Chief Executive Paul Polman has so far danced to his own tune. Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz's $143 billion merger offer, but Kraft still has hopes of reaching an agreement. WSJ's Saabira Chaudhuri has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Reuters \u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call for Unilever and they need to respond,\u201d\n            Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\n            \n      analyst Warren Ackerman said of the short-lived offer. Unilever declined to comment.  Kraft Heinz, meanwhile, has significantly improved its profitability since the 2015 deal that created the company, driven by the aggressive cost-cutting methods of Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital, its biggest shareholder. But it is now running out of costs to cut, leaving investors hungry for another deal. Kraft Heinz shares soared by 11% on Friday, as shareholders cheered the prospect of a new acquisition. U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of Presidents Day. Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar said the offer served \u201cas a reminder of Kraft Heinz\u2019s interest, capacity and commitment to pursuing large-scale M&A in a potentially near-term time horizon.\u201d "]
["Business", "3G, which has raised at least $10 billion in new funds, declined to comment. Analysts and investors expect\n            Mondelez International\n Inc.\n      to be a likely takeover target for Kraft Heinz, because it was part of Kraft before their 2012 breakup and has a strong presence in emerging markets where Kraft Heinz wants to expand. A Mondelez spokeswoman said \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on market rumors or speculation.\u201d Kraft Heinz said buying rivals isn\u2019t the only way for it to produce strong returns. Chief Financial Officer Paulo Basilio,  also a partner at 3G, said Wednesday that the company has decided to make additional investments in food-quality improvement and developing new products to boost sales.  \u201cWe don\u2019t need another acquisition to drive value,\u201d Mr. Basilio said.  Investors in companies led by 3G, including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Burger King operator\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nRestaurant Brands International\n Inc.,\n      have come to expect rapid returns. When savings max out a few years after a merger, 3G has a habit of making another sizable deal, beginning the process over again. At Heinz, which it bought in 2013 along with Warren Buffett,  3G managed to strip out $1 billion in annual costs before acquiring Kraft two years later. Last year, Kraft Heinz\u2019s operating-profit margin expanded 5 percentage points to 23% of sales."]
["Business", "The need for cost cuts is exacerbated by changing consumer tastes away from packaged goods and toward healthier offerings. Kraft Heinz, which logged $26.5 billion in sales last year, in 2015 said the deal would allow the combined conglomerate to revive the center aisles of supermarkets. But its comparable sales inched up 0.3% last year after falling 1.6% in 2015. Unilever\u2019s food business has fared better than most of its rivals in recent years, thanks in part to the company\u2019s large footprint in emerging markets, where consumer preference for packaged goods remains strong. Unlike Kraft, the company\u2019s biggest revenue sources come from its higher-margin personal- and home-care businesses, which sell things like soaps and detergents. But since Mr. Polman became CEO in January 2009, Unilever has posted a total shareholder return of 193%, according to Exane BNP Paribas data. The results underperform most of Unilever\u2019s European peers: 464% at\n            Henkel\n AG\n      , 290% at\n            Reckitt Benckiser Group\n            \n      PLC and 215% at\n            L\u2019Or\u00e9al\n SA\n      . Unilever\u2019s profit margins also have lagged behind those of some of its U.S. and European rivals, and the company rarely buys back shares, a strategy analysts say Mr. Polman views as financial engineering. Unilever last repurchased its shares in 2007 and last paid a special dividend in 1999."]
["Business", "\u201cInvestors have been very patient yet have been given relatively mediocre financial reward,\u201d said Exane analyst Jeff Stent. \u201cThis should not be back to business as usual at Unilever.\u201d Following Kraft Heinz\u2019s approach, Unilever could come under increased pressure to sell, spin off or strike a joint venture for its declining spreads business, which includes margarine brands such as Flora and Blue Band. \u201cJust because it\u2019s declining doesn\u2019t mean you just sell it; you only sell it if the price you can get for it is better than if you keep it,\u201d Mr. Polman told reporters last year. Analysts have also suggested Unilever could choose to divest certain local tea brands\u2014such as PG Tips in the U.K.\u2014and instead focus on launching premium tea brands more widely. Despite being the world\u2019s largest tea company, Unilever has turned in lackluster sales growth for years as consumers move away from mainstream black tea into areas such as green and herbal teas, to which it has less exposure. Mr. Polman has stayed away from large acquisitions in recent years, instead opting for a series of deals up to $1 billion, including last year\u2019s purchase of Dollar Shave Club Inc. But Kraft\u2019s approach underscores Unilever\u2019s vulnerability as the pound has weakened sharply against the dollar while Unilever investors hoping for a big payout have been left disappointed. All this could propel Mr. Polman to look at bigger acquisitions as a pathway to growth.  Post-Bid Unilever Could Face Push for Internal Changes  "]
["Business", "1528 GMT After the collapse of Kraft Heinz\u2019s $143 billion acquisition try, Unilever could now come under pressure to make internal changes in addition to weighing M&A moves. Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent noted that the average tenure of a Unilever executive is 24 years. The company\u2019s remuneration and shareholding policies also could come under fire: Bonuses aren\u2019t linked to per-share earnings, and Unilever\u2019s CEO is required to hold only four times his base salary in shares, compared with a requirement of 40 times base salary at rival Reckitt Benckiser.

Exane BNP Paribas on Monday raised its target price on Colgate to $90 from $68 and upgraded its rating, saying \u201cthe likelihood of Unilever seeking to acquire Colgate has now increased materially.\u201d Colgate closed Friday at $71.98, giving it a market value of nearly $64 billion."]

["Technology", "\u201cOne of our preconditions [of Amazon\u2019s acquisition] was that Zappos retain an independent culture and its way of doing business,\u201d Mr. Hsieh explained. \u201cThey recognize that we approach things very differently and are curious about things that work and don\u2019t work.\u201d Amazon sometimes adopts Zappos\u2019 successful methods, he noted. For example, with new employees, after four to five weeks, Zappos pays people to quit. Amazon has applied that to some of its operations, Mr. Hsieh said. Amazon\u2019s unorthodox culture has come under scrutiny after The New York Times reported that some employees suffered from high demands placed on them and a lack of support for work-life balance. Amazon has denied that it treats employees poorly. On Tuesday, Mr. Hsieh cited research suggesting that two main attributes separate great companies from mediocre ones over the long term: A higher purpose beyond profits and a strong culture. The research found that it didn\u2019t actually matter what the culture was, he said. Rather, it mattered how the culture was followed and how pervasive it was throughout the company, he added. In April, Zappos instituted a system called Holacracy and scrapped management positions, leaving employees to decide largely themselves how to get their work done. The shake-up, launched by Mr. Hsieh, has been jarring even for a company famous for doing things differently. In May, Zappos said about 14%, or 210, of its roughly 1,500 employees had decided Holacracy wasn\u2019t for them and planned to leave. "]

["Markets Main", "His testimony will be the first from a big-bank chief under fire since 2012. Back then, the committee brought in\n            J.P. Morgan Chase\n            \n      & Co. chief James Dimon to explain his bank\u2019s \u201cLondon whale\u201d trading losses, in which the company lost more than $6 billion. In one sense, the scene and sense of crisis might look familiar: \u201cAs we saw with J.P. Morgan with the London whale scandal, the fall from golden child to problem child can be difficult and expensive,\u201d Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a research note Tuesday. Mr. Stumpf, though, is contending with much different allegations, and already has taken a different approach than Mr. Dimon had. The outspoken and sometimes combative Mr. Dimon is perhaps the most recognizable face of U.S. banking. Before and after the London whale episode unfolded, Mr. Dimon cut a very public figure, not always to his benefit. He initially referred to reports of trading problems in his bank as \u201ca tempest in a teapot.\u201d J.P. Morgan chief James Dimon was quick to address the \u2018London whale\u2019 issue, once the bank owned it.Photo: Molly Riley/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Mr. Dimon was later forced to eat those words, telling the Senate panel he had been \u201cdead wrong.\u201d But that willingness to fall on his own sword ultimately worked to "]
["Markets Main", "Mr. Dimon\u2019s advantage. So, too, did his blunt talk about the nature of the problem. \u201cWe know we were sloppy, we know we were stupid, we know there was bad judgment,\u201d he said in a television interview. He and J.P. Morgan were also quick to address the issue, once they owned it. The bank held an investor call immediately after announcing the problem to markets. Mr. Stumpf cuts a very different figure. He has cultivated the image of his San Francisco bank as being apart from the Wall Street, big-bank crowd. And he himself is hardly a household name, even if he was among the country\u2019s top-paid bankers, earning total compensation of $19.3 million in 2015. Mr. Stumpf grew up on a small dairy farm in Pierz, Minn., that he has said left him smelling like cattle until he was 18. The second oldest of 11 children, he shared a bed with two of his brothers. \u201cI never got to sleep alone until I got married,\u201d he has said. At the age of 17, Mr. Stumpf left school because of poor grades and worked for a year in a bakery. He paid his way through college at St. Cloud State University by playing bass guitar in a rock band called The Mason-Dixon Line. After graduation he got his first job in banking as a repo man at First Bank in St. Paul. Mr. Stumpf joined the loan administration department of Northwestern National Bank, later known as Norwest, which merged with Wells Fargo in 1998."]
["Markets Main", "He was named chief executive officer in June 2007 and took the chairman\u2019s title in 2010. This narrative typically would be to his advantage in a Senate hearing. But the very Main Street nature of his bank\u2019s problems could make his task difficult. When Mr. Dimon testified about the whale mess, the roughly $6 billion in losses were staggering. Beyond that, though, the issues were complex, involving products such as credit-default-swap indexes and talk of asymmetric accounting. The $185 million figure Wells Fargo has to pay doesn\u2019t startle in the same way. But 5,300 does. That is the number of employees that Wells Fargo has fired over a five-year period due to allegedly improper sales practices. So is two million, the rough number of accounts that may have been opened by bank employees without customers\u2019 knowledge to help meet sales goals. And, so far, Mr. Stumpf\u2019s communications strategy has been far less direct than that of Mr. Dimon. Before interviews Tuesday, including with the Journal, his only public communication since the settlement announcement Thursday\u2014in which the bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing\u2014had been a short statement issued by the company. When he did speak, Mr. Stumpf focused on junior employees\u2019 role in breaking rules and not following the bank\u2019s ethics, rather than cultural or structural issues at the bank.\u00a0Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer echoed a similar sentiment earlier Tuesday."]
["Markets Main", "On top of all that, Mr. Stumpf faces a challenge that Mr. Dimon didn\u2019t have to contend with. Today, the banking committee includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and perhaps the toughest critic of big banks on Capitol Hill. She was one of the first lawmakers to call for Mr. Stumpf to testify and has already described Wells Fargo\u2019s alleged misconduct as \u201ca staggering fraud\u201d in a CNN interview.

It has also invested in semiconductors, robotics and other areas relevant to autonomous driving.

["Technology", "The technology \u201cis definitely coming, and when that comes, this ride-sharing business becomes even more important,\u201d he said. An Uber spokeswoman and a Lyft spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Son\u2019s remarks.  The Wall Street Journal has reported that SoftBank approached San Francisco-based Uber recently about a multibillion-dollar stake but that the negotiations were preliminary and any deal would likely be on hold until Uber hires a new CEO. Since the Vision Fund was started in May, SoftBank has announced new investments in companies such as shared office-space provider WeWork Cos., Indian mobile-payments firm Paytm, robotics firm Boston Dynamics, self-driving technology firms Nauto and Brain Corp., and many others. The biggest deal in dollar terms\u2014if it happens\u2014would likely be the one involving Sprint.

["Technology", "How much control Sprint and SoftBank would wield in any deal depends on how potential partners value Sprint\u2019s spectrum, which Mr. Son has touted as essential for fifth-generation, or 5G, networks.

WASHINGTON\u2014Legislation designed to improve background checks for gun purchases ran into new hurdles Monday, raising doubts about lawmakers\u2019 ability to act in the wake of the Florida school shooting. The background-checks bill, sponsored \u00a0by Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), would encourage states and federal agencies, including the military, to submit criminal-conviction records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. That step has broad bipartisan support. But some Democrats worried Monday that GOP lawmakers would seek to address the recent public outcry over gun violence by passing the Cornyn bill but no other gun-control legislation, and suggested they might withhold support. On the other side, some Republicans voiced concerns over how people flagged in the strengthened system could appeal."]
["Politics and Policy", "President Donald Trump has kept the pressure on lawmakers, who returned to Washington Monday after a weeklong recess, to change the nation\u2019s gun laws after a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., earlier this month. He has floated a number of possible measures, including improved background checks, banning devices known as \u201cbump stocks\u201d and further restricting gun purchases based on age and mental illness. Mr. Cornyn told reporters that he still saw his bill as the most likely common ground on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have struggled for years to pass any significant legislation connected to guns.  \u201cTo me that\u2019s the most obvious place to start,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said of his \u201cFix NICS\u201d bill, which he introduced after the background-check system failed to prevent the gunman in a Texas shooting last November from purchasing weapons, despite his history of domestic abuse. \u201cI\u2019m for doing what\u2019s achievable. If they want to get bogged down again and do nothing, to me that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Mr. Cornyn, who said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d the House would pass the bill on its own if approved by the Senate. Federal law requires agencies to submit to the background-check system records relevant to whether someone should be allowed to buy a firearm, such as criminal convictions. But at the state level, compliance is voluntary unless mandated by state law or federal funding requirements. Democrats don\u2019t object to the legislation itself, but said on its own, it wouldn\u2019t do enough to reduce gun violence."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cIf all Congress does in response to the Parkland shooting is to pass \u2018Fix NICS,\u2019 we won\u2019t have done our job,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Monday. \u201cWe must do more than that.\u201d President Donald Trump, in response to Florida\u2019s deadly school shooting, pledged action on certain gun regulations on Feb. 22, including background checks. He said he\u2019s concerned that violence on the internet, in videogames and in movies, is shaping how young \u201cminds are being formed.\u201d Photo: Agence France-Presse Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims. Some Democratic lawmakers are unlikely to initially support passage of the Cornyn bill if GOP leaders aren\u2019t willing to bring other gun-related legislation to the Senate floor, aides said. Others made clear they wouldn\u2019t block the \u201cFix NICS\u201d bill in an effort to push for more. \u201cMy view is every step is important,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.). \u201cIf it comes on the floor, I\u2019ll vote for it.\u201d Democrats are expected to discuss at a closed-door policy lunch on Tuesday what measures they will coalesce around, but they are likely to push for a vote on legislation that would expand background checks for all guns purchased online and at gun sales. Currently, the checks are needed only for sales by federally licensed dealers."]
["Politics and Policy", "The Cornyn bill also faces resistance from some conservatives, including GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have said they are concerned about how individuals flagged under the background check system would be able to appeal. On Monday, Mr. Lee objected when Mr. Cornyn checked to see if the bill could pass under unanimous consent, a process that would allow the bill to clear the chamber quickly, but only if all senators agree.  Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of around three dozen conservative House Republicans, said Monday night that he shared those concerns. The Cornyn bill passed the House in December, but there it was paired with legislation that would enable gun owners who legally carry concealed firearms in one state to carry them in the other 49 states\u2014a major expansion of gun rights. Conservative House Republicans are expected to protest any move to separate the two bills, but many centrist GOP lawmakers in competitive congressional districts have urged House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) to bring the \u201cFix NICS\u201d bill up on its own. House GOP leaders are looking to the Senate to take the next step, aides said Monday. Separately, Mr. Trump on Monday said he supported giving law-enforcement officials \u201cimmediate access\u201d to take weapons from the mentally ill and called for a national conversation on mental institutions. He also said he would be willing to take on the National Rifle Association."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cThey\u2019re on our side,\u201d Mr. Trump said, while acknowledging that \u201csometimes we\u2019re going to have to be very tough and we\u2019re going to have to fight them.\u201d  Lawmakers are expected to include more funding for mental health in a spending bill expected to be passed next month. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.,) who heads the House Education Committee, called on lawmakers on Monday to fund up to $1.6 billion in grants to schools for mental health and school security. Mr. Trump has called for lawmakers to ban \u201cbump stocks,\u201d gun accessories that allow some semiautomatic weapons to mimic full automatic ones. Mr. Trump recently signed a memorandum directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to develop regulations that would ban the sale and use of the devices.  \u201cBump stocks, we\u2019re writing them out\u2014I\u2019m writing that out myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if Congress does it or not.\u201d  Many lawmakers support banning bump stocks, but GOP leaders have looked to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to restrict bump stocks through regulations, rather than having Congress consider new legislation. Mr. Trump also has floated raising the minimum age to buy some guns to 21 years old, but didn\u2019t mention it in his remarks Monday.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president is \u201cstill supportive of the concept.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) said Monday he planned to introduce legislation this week with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) that would raise the minimum age to 21 for purchases of certain semiautomatic rifles that are often called assault weapons. "]

["World News", "Over the course of the two-and-a-half-hour marathon, however, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s barrage failed to deliver a destabilizing blow to the front-runner. Mr. Macron stood his ground, wearing his opponent down by highlighting what he said were technical holes in her sweeping plans to pull France out of the euro.  \u201cMr. Macron is the candidate of wild globalization,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.  Mr. Macron shot back that Ms. Le Pen was preaching isolationism. \u201cConfronted with this mind-set of defeat, I represent the mind-set of conquest,\u201d Mr. Macron said. A snap poll of 1,314 viewers by Elabe for BFMTV showed that 63% found Mr. Macron the most convincing and 34% Ms. Le Pen.  For Mr. Macron, who is running for elected office for the first time, the debate was a test of whether he can hold his footing under pressure from a battle-hardened National Front candidate who is tapping into deep resentment of globalization and the European Union. The debate was watched closely by investors, who sold French assets when Ms. Le Pen polled high ahead of the April 23 first-round vote. If Ms. Le Pen can turn the table on Mr. Macron during the debate, it could cast renewed doubt over the outcome of an election that is crucial for the future of the EU. He was relatively unknown in French politics. Now, he could become the youngest ever president of France. Who is Emmanuel Macron, what does he stand for, and could he win?

["World News", "Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, one of the most divisive politicians in Europe, is heading to the second round of voting in France's presidential election. What does she stand for, and can she win? WSJ's Niki Blasina reports. Photo: Getty Images. Ms. Le Pen proposes pulling France from the euro and a radical overhaul of the EU to repatriate powers in Paris and implement protectionist trade policies. On Wednesday, Ms. Le Pen sought to paint Mr. Macron as a crony of the EU establishment who lacks the gravitas to stand up to Germany. She also characterized him as weak on terrorism. Mr. Macron parried the attacks by questioning Ms. Le Pen\u2019s mastery of the radical policy changes she espouses.  In one exchange, Mr. Macron highlighted Ms. Le Pen\u2019s recent ambivalence over her proposed exit from the EU\u2019s common currency. Over the weekend, Ms. Le Pen appeared to backtrack on her vow to swiftly shepherd France out of the euro, saying negotiations wouldn\u2019t be rushed and that France would revive a basket of EU currencies to soften the transition to a franc.  \u201cWe need to get our national currency back. It\u2019s essential, essential,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re going back to the franc? You propose we actually leave the euro?\u201d Mr. Macron said.  \u201cNo, I want to renegotiate so we free ourselves from it and transform it into a common currency\u2014what it was before it became the currency of France,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said."]
["World News", "Mr. Macron said that no such system ever existed and companies couldn\u2019t pay their bills in two different currencies. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Mr. Macron said. Unlike Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron embraces the EU and prescribes labor overhauls to help France compete in global markets. The debate, which started at 9 p.m. local time, was expected to draw millions of viewers, as 34% of France\u2019s 47.6 million registered voters said they were sure to tune in and a further 31% said they probably would, according to a survey by polling company BVA.  In the 2012 election, more than 17 million watched the duel between current President Hollande and his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. With polls consistently showing Mr. Macron on track to win 60% of votes Sunday, Ms. Le Pen had a mountain to climb in the debate.  To stand a chance of rivaling Mr. Macron, the National Front candidate needs to pick up supporters from both conservative and far-left candidates who were knocked out in the first round of voting. In an attempt to cross the political spectrum, Ms. Le Pen went after blue-collar votes last week by making an impromptu appearance at a factory scheduled for closure just before her rival was due there. She also has attempted to tap center-right voters by lifting sections on French identity from a speech by mainstream conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon,  who was knocked out in the first round. Beyond the result itself, Sunday\u2019s vote will be key to determining the strength of the two candidates\u2019 parties in legislative elections in mid-June."]

["World News", "Mr. Erdogan, the most trusted politician in Turkey, with approval ratings above 50%, has led his ruling Justice and Development Party to back-to-back electoral victories since 2002, aided by a strong track record of 5% average annual economic growth. He is pushing a plan to endow his currently ceremonial office with executive powers similar to those in the U.S. and Russia through constitutional amendments that must pass a vote in Parliament and then a referendum.   However, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs since the July coup attempt. Opposition politicians see a chance to lure voters to their side as weakening confidence in Turkey\u2019s stability reverberates across the economy, which economists forecast to expand by less than 3% this year. The data shows that the economic downturn was driven by a collapse in private domestic consumption, which tumbled by an annualized 3.2% in the third quarter.  Even soaring government spending, which jumped 23.8% in the same period, wasn\u2019t enough to halt Turkey\u2019s economic decline.

A broader emerging-markets selloff also shook Turkey, where companies\u2019 foreign-currency debt was at $294 billion in September, about 37% of GDP and one of the highest in developing markets.

The unemployment rate also remains persistently high at 11.3% as of August, the highest since January 2015.

Republicans say Berea College deserves the exemption because the small liberal-arts Christian college is unusual, even unique: It accepts only low-income students and fully covers their tuition costs, while they work to pay for living expenses. \u201cEach year, Berea uses the returns on its endowment almost solely for scholarships, which sets it apart from nearly every other college and university in the nation,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said recently on the Senate floor."]
["Politics and Policy", "Democrats, however, accuse Mr. McConnell of favoring a school in his home state while ignoring the fact that the new law, by taxing large university endowments, damages numerous other schools that also subsidize poorer students. \u201cThe truth is that while Berea College is an excellent school, there are colleges all over this country that use their endowment funds to provide free, or significantly reduced, tuition for lower-income students,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.). Mr. Sanders successfully pushed for the Berea exemption to be stripped from the tax bill on procedural grounds. Now, Republicans hope to insert a Berea exemption in a coming spending or tax bill. \u201cThis is what happens when complicated legislation is written behind closed doors and is enacted hastily,\u201d said Terry Hartle,  a senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents and opposes the endowment tax.

Republicans created the tax on large university endowments, defined as those worth at least $500,000 per student, as one of several new sources of revenue in their $1.5 trillion net tax cut. The tax is expected to bring in $1.8 billion over a decade and sweeps in about 30 schools, from large research universities like Harvard and Stanford to smaller liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore in Pennsylvania."]

Still, Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said the new law puts the treatment of wealthy universities in line with that of large private foundations. Democrats say the Republicans just used the tax law to target what they see as highly educated, liberal elites.  The affected universities are raising alarms, saying the new tax will siphon money that would otherwise go to aiding students. In penalizing the wealthiest institutions, they say, the tax targets the very places that often provide the most generous student-aid packages. \u201cWhile I understand the broader frustration around how we finance higher education in this country, this does nothing to fix that,\u201d said Raynard Kington,  president of Grinnell College, a liberal arts school in Iowa with an endowment of about $1.9 billion. He said the school spends about $50 million a year on tuition assistance, and he estimated the tax would cost it between $1 and $4 million annually. That could force the school to cut back aid or other academic resources, he said."]
["Politics and Policy", "Some higher-education analysts said the effect of the tax will be muted, particularly for universities with multibillion-dollar endowments. It\u2019s possible that smaller schools, like Grinnell, could feel a larger impact, they said. \u201cI think the effects of the endowment tax are more about the rhetoric around it than the actual effect it will have,\u201d said Ben Miller, senior director of postsecondary education at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress. \u201cThe big purpose of this was really to send a message to the perceived elites of higher education.\u201d Republican lawmakers say the impact on Berea will be more tangible. Founded in 1855 by abolitionists as a place to educate freed slaves and white students side-by-side, the school has become known for graduating low-income students, often debt-free, who give back to the institution later in life. Berea\u2019s president, Lyle Roelofs,  estimated the school would owe a little more than $1 million in taxes on earnings from its $1 billion endowment. That\u2019s the equivalent of educating about 30 students at $35,000 a head, he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the government could use the $1 million from us, but I\u2019m also sure that 30 students could use the free education more,\u201d he said. While Democrats say Republicans are targeting universities, Mr. McConnell says Democrats are targeting Berea. GOP leaders used a parliamentary procedure to pass the tax bill that required its provisions to impact the federal budget. When the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the provision exempting Berea didn\u2019t meet that criterion, Democrats raised a procedural challenge stripping it."]

The world\u2019s two biggest economic blocs have been negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, since 2013, and have repeatedly said they hope to conclude negotiations before the end of the Obama administration in January. \u201cThe debate showed that a conclusion of the TTIP negotiations by the end of the year is unrealistic,\u201d said Peter Ziga,  Slovakia\u2019s trade minister who presided over the ministers\u2019 meeting in the Slovak capital, Bratislava."]
["Europe News", "During Friday\u2019s meeting, \u201call ministers expressed their doubts about being able to conclude this before the end of the Obama presidency, and indeed it looks increasingly unlikely,\u201d said Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m,  the EU\u2019s trade commissioner.  Prospects for completing the deal have suffered from weakening political support in Europe as well as growing public criticism, as antiglobalization sentiment has gained tractionrisen on both sides of the Atlantic. The trans-Atlantic talks have generated more widespread disapproval in Europe than in Washington, where the Obama administration is struggling to get a major Pacific deal through Congress but would also like to finish the lower-profile talks with Europe. \u201cIf the EU and its member states are prepared and have the necessary political will, we can complete an agreement this year,\u201d said Matt McAlvanah,  a spokesman for U.S. trade representative Michael Froman. \u201cThe U.S. remains engaged and ready to move forward on an ambitious TTIP agreement.\u201d On Sept. 17, hundreds of thousands of people marched through seven German cities to protest against the EU\u2019s planned trade pacts with the U.S. and Canada, highlighting a strengthening public backlash against the bloc\u2019s trans-Atlantic trade policies. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has added further uncertainty for negotiators on both sides, as it means the loss of one of the bloc\u2019s strongest trade advocates and one of the largest economies originally expected be part of the pact. Longstanding sticking points in the negotiations persist, including over European rules protecting regional food names such as feta, Parma ham or champagne, and U.S. rules protecting domestic companies bidding for government contracts."]
["Europe News", "Still, EU officials have played down delays in the negotiations, stressing that getting the deal right is more important than getting it on time. \u201cIt has always been our intention to conclude a good agreement,\u201d Ms. Malmstr\u00f6m said. \u201cIt will have to take the time needed, substance can never be sacrificed on behalf of speed,\u201d she added. Several EU ministers, including German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel,  have publicly criticized the deal, with French trade minister Matthias Fekl calling for an end to the negotiations. But this month, ministers from 12 EU countries voiced their support to negotiations with the U.S., in an effort to throw their weight behind the faltering negotiations. A planned round of negotiations in New York is still set to take place during the first week of October. EU leaders are also expected to discuss TTIP at their next summit in October, while trade ministers will meet again in November, after the U.S. election has taken place. If negotiations aren\u2019t concluded by the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, then a natural pause will ensue while the new president decides on the priorities, Ms. Malmstr\u00f6m said, but she added that it is difficult to tell how long it would be. \u2014William Mauldin in Washington contributed to this article.

["Financial Regulation", "Turning serious, Mr. Stumpf encouraged examiners to \u201ccontinue viewing your banks as partners,\u00a0not as your problems,\u201d according to a recording of his previously unreported remarks reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The recording of Mr.\u00a0Stumpf five years ago offers a rare window into how the Wells Fargo CEO and OCC talked to each other at the time. Regulators saw the San Francisco-based institution\u00a0as one of the better-run and more-reliable megabanks, having emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis. In his introduction of Mr. Stumpf, Michael L. Brosnan, then the OCC\u2019s senior deputy comptroller for large-bank supervision, said that the Wells Fargo CEO was invited in part because \u201cwhile Wells Fargo is a large bank, it is also the quintessential community bank.\u201d Now, the Wells Fargo\u00a0sales-tactics scandal, which cost Mr. Stumpf his job, has renewed longstanding questions of whether the OCC has been sufficiently aggressive in policing the firms it oversees. The OCC has said it first noticed account irregularities at Wells Fargo\u00a0based on exams that started\u00a0in late 2011. It first publicly reprimanded Wells Fargo this September. \u201cThis timeline begs the question: Where were the federal regulators during those years?\u201d asked Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, during a\u00a0Sept. 20\u00a0hearing on the Wells Fargo case.  An OCC spokesman said that in the years before it imposed a $185 million fine on the bank\u2014jointly with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles\u00a0City Attorney\u2019s office\u2014it issued five private supervisory letters to the bank between February 2013\u00a0and July 2016 demanding corrective actions on matters such as its account sales practices."]
["Financial Regulation", "Wells Fargo has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Mr. Stumpf resigned in mid-October amid the sales scandal, and the bank continues to face a raft of federal and state investigations, including from the Justice Department. Asked to comment on Mr. Stumpf\u2019s 2011 speech, an OCC\u00a0spokesman said that\u00a0\u201cthe purpose of having a bank CEO [at the event] was to provide a banker\u2019s perspective of the industry that was still responding to a recent crisis.\u201d He added that,\u00a0contrary\u00a0to\u00a0the Wells Fargo executive\u2019s\u00a0statements, \u201cthe OCC is not a partner of the banks it regulates.\u201d The regulator had previously faced criticism of overly close ties to regulated banks in the wake of the financial crisis, and in 2012 for failing to detect or prevent the\u00a0more than $6 billion\u00a0\u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading loss at\n            J.P. Morgan Chase\n            \n      & Co.

["Financial Regulation", "A March 2013 report by the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations quoted an email from Mr. Brosnan to Mr. Curry playing down the significance of the London Whale incident, saying that \u201cthere isn\u2019t a safety issue with these numbers, but there is an embarrassment issue for the bank.\u201d When Mr. Curry responded \u201cisn\u2019t it a little more than embarrassment issue?\u201d Mr. Brosnan wrote back: \u201cAt the end of the day they are good at financial risk\u201d management. The Senate report said Mr. Brosnan\u2019s comments showed that \u201cthe skepticism and demand for hard evidence that might be expected of bank regulators were absent.\u201d A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Brosnan\u2019s defenders felt the Senate report took the email out of context, because he meant the bank had the financial capacity to withstand the trading losses so it wasn\u2019t a threat to the bank\u2019s stability. In January 2013, Mr. Brosnan\u00a0left\u00a0his position overseeing large bank supervision to take a lower job at the agency, and he retired from the OCC\u00a0last month. In introducing Mr. Stumpf in 2011, \u00a0Mr.\u00a0Brosnan said that during \u201cour darkest days\u201d he had asked Mr. Stumpf \u201con more than one occasion\u201d to move up the timing of the banks\u2019 unusually upbeat earnings announcements ahead of other institutions \u201cso we would set a tone that the world isn\u2019t ending.\u201d He added to laughter: \u201cOf course, John never did move those earnings up, but.\u00a0 Wells, frankly, outperformed every bank that we had in terms of bottom-line performance.\u201d"]
["Financial Regulation", "One factor that may have complicated the OCC\u2019s Wells Fargo probe was the need to coordinate with the CFPB, created in 2010 after the financial crisis to bolster what some lawmakers felt was insufficient action by traditional regulators to crack down when banks were suspected of violating consumer rights. Multiple officials from both agencies, say competition between the two regulators helped delay a Wells Fargo settlement agreement. In his July 2011 comments to the OCC, Mr. Stumpf criticized the CFPB for being overly suspicious of his bank. \u201cI can\u2019t help but smile,\u201d he said, recalling a meeting with a CFPB official who \u201cwanted to know where the small-print department was in the bank, because they actually believed we have a small-print department that fools customers and has an earnings objective to it.\u201d Mr. Stumpf couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Greeson Dunn\u00a0said that\u00a0\u201cWells Fargo cannot comment on the contents or authenticity of the recording since we were not given an opportunity to listen to it.\u201d Responding to the quotes from Mr. Stumpf, she added:\u00a0\u201cWells Fargo supports openness and transparency with regulators, which we believe is in the best interests of our customers, shareholders and the integrity, safety and soundness of the U.S. financial system.\u201d CFPB spokesman David Mayorga said: \u201cWe value coordination and always believe our work is stronger when it is conducted alongside our federal and state partners, including the OCC.\u201d Amid the Wells Fargo scandal, Mr. Curry is again promising improvements in OCC oversight."]

If he fails, it is likely to revive the nationalist challenge to the European Union represented by Marine Le Pen,  his beaten opponent in Sunday\u2019s French presidential election. At the core of the French president-elect\u2019s program is a double overhaul: of France\u2019s sluggish economy and of the eurozone, with all its shortcomings. To get what he wants, Mr. Macron needs Europe\u2019s dominant economic power, Germany, to accept a rethink. His proposals, including for a common eurozone budget, go against firmly held German views that eurozone countries should follow common rules but keep their taxpayers\u2019 money separate."]
["Europe News", "Yet the stakes are as high for German Chancellor Angela Merkel as for Mr. Macron. In recent months Berlin\u2019s political establishment feared losing its closest partner in Europe, France, to a nationalist backlash against the EU.

The Dutch far-right Party for Freedom fell short of its aims in elections in March, and the nationalist Alternative for Germany is currently mired in internal squabbles, but the government establishment in both countries fears the potential of such movements in an age of discontent with mainstream parties. Immediately after Emmanuel Macron assumes the French presidency, he will face another challenge that will determine his authority for the next five years: the June legislative elections.

If they can\u2019t rebuild public trust in the European project, battered by a decade of crises, populist insurgents on the left and right will return strengthened in the next election cycle. Economic growth is improving in the bloc, but it remains unevenly spread, and deep scars from the crisis era persist, including high unemployment in France and Europe\u2019s indebted South.

Such a deepening of the eurozone, however, risks fueling political opposition to a further loss of national sovereignty. The first big hurdle facing Mr. Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, is to convince a skeptical Berlin. \u201cFor Macron to succeed, he needs a partner in Germany,\u201d said former European Central Bank director J\u00f6rg Asmussen. \u201cIf Macron can show that he is able to shape change in Europe, that would also help him domestically.\u201d Last week, Mr. Asmussen joined with numerous, mainly left-of-center German politicians, economists and other public figures in a public call for Berlin to engage with Mr. Macron and not rebuff his ideas. The strength of anti-EU voter sentiment in France partly reflects the perception that Germany dominates Europe, their joint statement said."]
["Europe News", "The prevailing view in Chancellor Merkel\u2019s government, however is that\u2014given\u00a0the current antiestablishment mood\u00a0in much of the continent\u2014more steps toward a federal Europe would inflame anti-EU populism, rather than countering it. Germany\u2019s political establishment has looked doubtfully upon French ideas for collective, state-directed investment programs for decades. Yet Berlin is also keen for Mr. Macron to succeed at home where outgoing President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande failed: in\u00a0shaking up a sluggish French economy. Economists say France needs to overhaul its heavily regulated labor market, where restrictions have contributed to stubbornly high unemployment of around 10%. The price if Mr. Macron were to fail, many policy makers across the EU fear, could well be victory in the 2022 presidential elections for Ms. Le Pen, a far-right, anti-EU nationalist. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel,  who recently stepped down as leader of the center-left Social Democrats, has also welcomed Mr. Macron\u2019s call to reform the eurozone.  But his party, the junior partner in Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition in Berlin, is deeply ambivalent about putting more of German taxpayers\u2019 money at Europe\u2019s disposal. Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats are even less eager. Neither of Germany\u2019s two major parties is campaigning for deeper European integration ahead of the country\u2019s elections this September. Political strategists for both parties believe there are no votes in it. Even Social Democrat candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz has been circumspect, despite his pro-federalist stance in his previous post as president of the European Parliament."]
["Europe News", "Aware of the prevailing skepticism, Mr. Macron made his pitch to Germany in a speech at Berlin\u2019s Humboldt University in January. His language was diplomatic, but the subtext was clear: Germany\u2019s huge trade surpluses and fixation on fiscal austerity have hurt growth and support for the EU elsewhere in the continent. Offering a \u201cNew Deal,\u201d Mr. Macron suggested France needed to win Germany\u2019s trust through overhauls to meet eurozone fiscal rules\u2014and that Germany should accept that it can\u2019t sustain economic growth if other nations in the euro are struggling. \u201cThe euro is incomplete and cannot last without major reforms,\u201d he said. Concretely, he proposed a common eurozone budget, funded from both tax revenues and common borrowing, which would finance investment programs, and support countries hit by economic crises. Economists close to Mr. Macron say he knows that to gain more credibility with Germany than Mr. Hollande had he must show he can push through difficult economic overhauls in France. Germany\u2019s powerful finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble,  has said repeatedly over the past year that the time isn\u2019t right for deeper integration of the EU or eurozone, because public support for a federal Europe is lacking. He has called instead for more ad hoc cooperation between governments that are willing to act together in areas such as defense.\u00a0Mr. Sch\u00e4uble is seen throughout the eurozone as the toughest foe of proposals for common fiscal policies that could create new liabilities for Germany."]
["Europe News", "Germany\u2019s September election might lead to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble leaving the finance ministry, if the Social Democrats demand the ministry in return for serving again under Ms. Merkel. However, even the Social Democrats have rarely strayed far from German orthodoxy on finance, fearing that the Christian Democrats would attack them for handing German taxpayers\u2019 money to Southern Europe. \u201cMacron is not blind to German views,\u201d says Nicolas Veron,  a French economist and fellow at Brussels think tank Bruegel. \u201cHis aim is not fiscal union, but to start a meaningful conversation about how to strengthen the eurozone.

["Technology", "Amazon has said it expects to create as many as 50,000 jobs paying an average of $100,000 at its new site. Supplying that many employees is a feat for any area, and is likely to result in greater competition for workers and wage increases at a time when unemployment already stands at a low 4.1% nationally, some economists say. \u201cWe\u2019re nervous,\u201d says Steven Kosakow,  director of talent acquisition at Lionbridge, a Boston-based company that helps firms with translation and globalization services. Lionbridge is building out its sales team, and recruiters there worry that hiring salespeople will become nearly impossible if Amazon moves in. Boston is among the cities on the shortlist. Employers are concerned in part because there\u2019s little known about Amazon\u2019s hiring plans. \u201cNo one knows who they\u2019re moving,\u201d says Andrew Gadomski,  a consultant who helps large employers execute recruiting campaigns. Amazon\u2019s effect on local employment would depend partly on the kinds of jobs it plans to fill, he said. Still, more competition for the same workers in general could mean that hiring decisions become protracted and firms have difficulty filling slots. Amazon is already known for poaching talent from companies, including\n            United Parcel Service \n            \n      Inc. and\n            General Electric\n Co.\n      , and that would become even easier if the tech giant were also located in the neighborhood. Both Atlanta, where UPS is based, and Boston, where GE is building its new headquarters, are on Amazon\u2019s shortlist."]
["Technology", "Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Some executives at companies in the Atlanta area, including UPS and\n            Home Depot\n Inc.,\n      are voicing concerns about the impact on the local job markets, according to people familiar with the matter. A UPS spokesman said the company isn\u2019t throwing its support behind any specific city where it operates because of its wide reach as a company. Where it competes for workers, \u201cwe are committed to being a preferred employer,\u201d he said. A Home Depot spokesman said the company is primarily concerned about whether Amazon will receive higher tax incentives than the norm. Amazon\u2019s search for a second headquarters has set off a beauty contest, with local governments offering incentives or working to fix local problems. Georgia legislators, for instance, are considering providing substantial state funding for Atlanta\u2019s mass-transit system, partly to address concerns that traffic congestion might hurt its chances to land Amazon.   Audrey Russo,  president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Technology Council, which helped formulate the city\u2019s proposal and represents about 1,200 employers, says many of her group\u2019s members simply want more details at this point, including what kinds of workers Amazon will want."]
["Technology", "\u201cOur members are data-focused and they want facts and at this point we can\u2019t articulate the facts,\u201d she said. In Seattle, where Amazon has expanded its original headquarters to more than 40,000 people from just a few thousand a decade ago, its presence there has been both positive and negative. Labor competition has intensified and living costs have risen, but local tech employers have benefited from the online retail juggernaut\u2019s being there. The city, also home to\n            Microsoft\n Corp.\n      , has seen a boom in startups, many led by former Amazon employees. Tech giants, including\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\u2019s\n      Google and\n            Apple\n Inc.,\n      have also set up big offices in the area. \u201cI think we have a very competitive job market in Seattle, in part because of Amazon,\u201d said Tom Alberg,  managing director of venture-capital firm Madrona Venture Group and an Amazon board member. Amazon has created jobs, new opportunities for people to move to the area and become better educated, \u201cso we\u2019re actually producing more people to fill these jobs,\u201d he said.  Amazon\u2019s impact on local labor markets could be a net positive if its arrival draws workers from other areas and expands the overall pool of educated, ambitious workers, says Mark Muro,  senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cA regional ecosystem becoming more dense with added talent can bring significant returns.\u201d"]
["Technology", "Officials in Toronto, the only city outside the U.S. to make Amazon\u2019s shortlist, played up the region\u2019s access to affordable engineering talent in its proposal. But some local executives have opposed the idea, citing an existing shortage of engineers as well as a soaring housing market. Instead, Amazon could suck Canadian workers to the company\u2019s Seattle base rather than improve Canada\u2019s economy, says Toronto-based venture capitalist Anthony Lacavera,  who launched the country\u2019s fourth wireless company a decade ago. Even in a city as big as Chicago, another finalist, the scale of hiring could be unprecedented.\n            Motorola Solutions\n            \n      recently put its headquarters there, and Kraft Heinz set up a second main office. But even the relocation of\n            McDonald\u2019s\n Corp.\n      , which will move its headquarters downtown from a Chicago suburb this year, is expected to bring only around 2,000 jobs. \nBest Buy\n Co.\n      and\n            Target\n Corp.\n      both expressed concerns to Minnesota\u2019s governor regarding a bid by Minneapolis-Saint Paul to woo Amazon, one of their biggest rivals. At a media briefing in October, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell told reporters that while he wants to see continued prosperity for the area, \u201con behalf of our shareholders, I want to make sure we get the same benefits as any other company.\u201d"]

(Update: Glencore shares rebound despite gloomy China outlook)."]
["Markets Main", "The combination of debt and sagging mining earnings led to a pummeling of the stock. On Monday, Glencore\u2019s shares plunged 29% to 68.6 pence, about $1.04, its biggest one-day decline since it went public in 2011. Overall, its stock is down almost 90% since that public offering. That is a sharp twist on what has long been Glencore\u2019s prime selling point. Executives told investors its trading business would provide a cushion for earnings during a downturn in commodity prices, making it more attractive than competitors. In its prospectus for its 2011 public offering, the company said its trading business is \u201cless correlated to commodity prices than its industrial operations, making Glencore\u2019s earnings generally less volatile than those of pure producers of metals, mining and energy products.\u201d Instead, Glencore has lost billions of dollars in value as prices for what it produces, buys and sells\u2014from copper to coal to oil\u2014have hit multiyear lows this year.  The mix of spiraling downward prices and high debt is turning out to be Glencore\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, market observers said.  \u201cThey\u2019d touted the trading business as being a less cyclical business that would stabilize the more cyclical mining business,\u201d said Craig Pirrong,  finance professor and commodity expert at the University of Houston. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened is the extreme cyclicality of the mining business has compromised its viability as a trading company.\u201d"]
["Markets Main", "Some Glencore investors play down concerns about the company and express bafflement over the recent selloff. They point to solid results from Glencore\u2019s traders, who pulled in $1.1 billion in profit in the first half of the year, and access to billions in credit. Mr. Glasenberg earlier this month said his debt-reduction plan should protect Glencore against a \u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario in commodity prices. The company\u2019s DNA had been trading, ever since it was founded in the 1970s by financier Marc Rich. It avoided owning mining assets, which it saw as risky and exposed to sharp unpredictable swings, and focused on buying and selling commodities around the world. The company shifted gears in the 1990s, after a team of executives, including Mr. Glasenberg, bought the company from Mr. Rich and began branching out into mines, especially Mr. Glasenberg\u2019s specialty: coal. Its biggest move came with the $29.5 billion megadeal for mining titan Xstrata, which came just as the superheated commodity-price boom was ending.  At the time the acquisition was announced in 2012, Mr. Glasenberg said the deal was a \u201cbig play\u201d on coal prices, which have plunged since. The entire mining sector is getting pummeled.\n            Anglo American\n            \n      PLC fell 10% on Monday and is down 54% so far this year.\n        Rio Tinto\n          \n      PLC has tumbled 30% this year and\n            BHP Billiton\n Ltd.\n      is down 16%.

The company has a vast trading arm funded by nearly $18 billion in short-term debt\u2014often revolving lines that roll over roughly every 30 days, a person familiar. with the matter said. Aware that investors were unhappy, Glencore took measures three weeks ago, announcing plans for $10 billion in debt reduction through a stock sale, a dividend cut, asset sales and cost reductions. Analysts say these moves may not be enough. One sign of mounting concern: the cost of insuring Glencore\u2019s debt surged on renewed fears that the company may need to announce even more drastic measures to cut net debt.  Investors had to pay on Monday more than $790,000 a year to insure $10 million of Glencore debt against default for five years using credit default swaps, according to Markit, more than 40% higher than Friday. At the beginning of the year, the same insurance cost $154,000.  While Glencore\u2019s debt is still rated BBB investment grade by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services, Markit analyst Simon Colvin said the market is trading Glencore\u2019s CDS as if the company had a credit rating of CCC. That is just four notches above default grade.  That shows \u201cthe market didn\u2019t really buy the capital-raising effort,\u201d Mr. Colvin said. Glencore\u2019s bonds also fell sharply Monday.  The yield on a U.S. dollar bond set to mature in 2022 jumped to more than 11% at one point, up from 6.4% on Friday, according to MarketAxess data. The bond yielded about 4.6% at the end of July.

["Heard on the Street", "This complicates Wall Street\u2019s hopes for a \u201csupercycle\u201d that would drive Apple\u2019s shares still higher. Another wrinkle is that the new design is widely expected to cost a lot more\u2014with a starting price rumored at more than $1,000. That is more in line with some of the company\u2019s MacBook computers, and it would make the new iPhone the most expensive phone ever in the U.S., according to Cliff Maldonado of BayStreet Research. Apple also appears to still be ironing out some key functions. The new phone is expected to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8 that went on sale in April. This is becoming a popular way for smartphone makers to increase their display real estate without bloating the device\u2019s size farther. Counterpoint Research projects shipments of such OLED devices will hit 115 million this year and triple next year as OLED supply improves.

Andy Hargreaves of KeyBanc Capital says Apple will need to order the necessary chips for the feature by next month in order to manufacture enough devices ahead of the holidays."]

At least nine analysts over the past month have lowered their projected iPhone sales for the current fiscal year that ends in September. Most have shifted their forecasts into the next year. As a result, iPhone unit sales are expected to grow just 2% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018, according to FactSet. That means Apple\u2019s forecast for the September quarter\u2014expected when the company reports fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1\u2014may not fully reflect this year\u2019s iPhone launch. And longer term, it is unclear how such an expensive phone will be received. iPhones have typically been priced in line with other premium smartphones.

["Technology", "Whales are a big deal because less than 3% of all mobile-game players make any in-game purchases. Buyers spend a rough average of $5 to $25 a month. Whales rank in the top 10% of all in-game spenders, and the mobile-game industry is scrambling to spawn and catch many more of them. Some game makers say there is no turning back from the strategy because too few smartphone and tablet users will pay to download games. Hogrocket Ltd., a three-man mobile-game developer in the U.K., charged $2.99 for \u201cTiny Invaders\u201d when the game about space germs went on sale in 2011.

King and other game makers also have scaled back their use of advertising. For years, ads were a crucial revenue strategy, and game developers often sprung obtrusive banner ads on gamers or stopped the action for 30-second video pitches.

["Technology", "The time crunch \u201cmotivates players to take action now,\u201d says Chris Akhavan,  Glu\u2019s president of publishing. He says the San Francisco company also refuses to design games that hook gamers with a few free levels but then get so hard that players have to buy a certain weapon, more lives or extra energy to be successful. The tactic was common in the industry but is going out of style as developers of free-to-play games try to deepen the loyalty of users who might become whales someday. Spending estimates on what makes someone a whale vary.

Another possibility: Instead of offering to sell 500 coins to the game player at the regular price of $4.99, the player might get 600 coins for the same price.   WSJ.D is the Journal\u2019s home for tech news, analysis and product reviews.

Proletariat, which hadn\u2019t launched a mobile game before, spent nearly 18 months and $2 million to develop it. The company says it is breaking even, with about 5% of players buying digital goods, according to co-founder and CEO Seth Sivak.

["Tax Report", "The provision included in the Senate bill requires investors who are selling partial positions to assume that lots of securities bought at different prices are sold on a \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d (FIFO) basis. The provision would affect \u201cpassive\u201d index funds and exchange-traded funds, as well as actively managed ones. \u201cVanguard is concerned with language that requires funds to sell their oldest shares first\u2014mostly likely increasing significantly the amount of taxable distributions made to investors every year,\u201d a Vanguard spokeswoman said in a statement. Here\u2019s how the provision works: Say an investor owns two lots of one stock bought at different prices, and they are held in a taxable account rather than a tax-deferred retirement account. If the stock is trading at $100 now, each share acquired five years ago for $60 would have a $40 taxable gain. But each share bought two years ago at $110 would have a $10 loss. Current law allows investors, including fund managers, to choose which shares they part with. So selling shares bought for $110 would yield a loss that could offset other gains, while selling shares bought for $60 would produce a taxable gain. If the provision takes effect, the first shares sold would be deemed to have a cost of $60 each, and an investor couldn\u2019t sell the $110 shares until all $60 shares were gone. The change would take effect for sales in 2018. It is estimated to raise $2.7 billion over 10 years."]

The proposed change would affect individual investors who have taxable accounts and holdings\u00a0of one security\u00a0bought at different times as well as funds. The provision would make it more difficult for investors to \u201charvest\u201d losses by selling specific shares that have gone down in value.

A...\n A federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration and refugees, a decision that applies nationwide to tens of thousands of people holding visas to travel to the U.S. While previous court orders addressed the plight of detained travelers, U.S. District Judge James Robart\u2019s more-sweeping ruling stops the executive order entirely.  A week ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries\u2014Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\u2014for at least 90 days, calling it a needed move to keep terrorists from entering the U.S. It also froze the entire U.S. refugee program for four months, barred Syrians from entering as refugees indefinitely and cut the number of refugees the U.S. will accept in fiscal year 2017 to 50,000, less than half the number that former President Barack Obama called for this year."]
["U.S. News", "Judge Robart, in his seven-page ruling, wrote that he granted the restraining order, in part, because the plaintiffs were likely to win on their constitutional claims. Not halting the president\u2019s executive order immediately would cause the plaintiffs \u201cirreparable injury,\u201d the judge wrote.  \u201cThe Executive Order adversely affects the States\u2019 residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,\u201d Judge Robart wrote. \u201cIn addition, the States themselves are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the Executive Order has inflicted upon the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning\u2026These harms are significant and ongoing.\u201d  In a Saturday morning tweet, the president sharply criticized the judge. \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump wrote.  The suit that led to Judge Robart\u2019s ruling was filed by the state of Washington. The state\u2019s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, said, \u201cWhat the judge announced today is nationwide\u2014the president\u2019s executive order does not apply.\u201d Airlines including Air France and Deutsche Lufthansa AG responded to the ruling Saturday, saying all passengers with valid travel documents including from the seven countries included in the ban would be allowed to travel to the U.S.  How immigration officials throughout the country will handle the judge\u2019s temporary halt of Mr. Trump\u2019s order wasn\u2019t immediately clear. "]
["U.S. News", "White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement that the Justice Department \u201cintends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the president, which we believe is lawful and appropriate.\u201d An earlier version of his statement, released by the White House, called the order \u201coutrageous.\u201d On Saturday, the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal to the Seattle court\u2019s ruling. District judges don\u2019t often issue nationwide injunctions, but they have happened in recent years in high-profile cases. A federal judge in Los Angeles in 2010 issued a nationwide injunction against the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, which banned openly gay men and women from serving in the military. And in 2015, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction blocking the implementation of Obama administration policies that granted some protection to children of illegal immigrants.  But with such orders come a host of legal caveats and possible complications. Judges in other districts are free to make and implement rulings that go against nationwide orders, according to legal experts. And nationwide orders are often put on temporary hold by appeals courts, to stave off uncertainty that might otherwise ensue. Immigration lawyers said the ruling was sweeping and, at least for now, was being taken to mean that refugees and people from the seven banned countries could once again enter the U.S. "]
["U.S. News", "\u201cWe\u2019re interpreting this ruling as saying the executive order is invalidated,\u201d said Diane Butler, an immigration lawyer who was in the courtroom in Seattle when the ruling was given and sits on the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  In practical terms, however, the ruling was unlikely to have immediate impact for a large number of immigrants, refugees and visa-holders, immigrant-rights activists and lawyers said. Many were still trying to figure out exactly how the judge\u2019s order might be implemented. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would need to receive the order and update its protocols. That, as well as alerting embassy offices around the world, could take time, especially on a weekend, experts said. However, Ms. Butler said the State Department should now be able to re-validate the tens of thousands of visas it revoked this week.  Immigration lawyers expected the ruling to be appealed by the Justice Department. But meanwhile, Ms. Butler said lawyers were advising their clients\u2014both refugees and those hailing from the banned countries\u2014to once again attempt to enter the U.S. if they could.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the word out to our clients to arrive with a smile on their face and present themselves as if they are entitled to be here,\u201d she said.  Judge Robart\u2019s ruling capped a hectic day of court hearings around the country as individuals, civil-rights groups and state officials sought to strike down the executive order."]
["U.S. News", "At a hearing in federal court in Virginia, a Justice Department lawyer said the order had led to the revocation of more than 100,000 visas\u2014a statement that was quickly contradicted by the State Department, which said the correct figure was fewer than 60,000. A small percentage of those people, who were already in transit to the U.S. when the new rule went into effect, were detained at U.S. airports. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema,  who presided over the trial of Sept. 11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui,  indicated she was surprised by the public response to the travel-ban case. \u201cThis order touched something in the U.S. that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Judge Brinkema said while presiding over the Virginia hearing. \u201cPeople are quite upset.\u201d The judge also said it appeared there hadn\u2019t been enough thought put into the order before it was issued, resulting in \u201cchaos.\u2019\u2019 The judge allowed lawyers for the state of Virginia to join the lawsuit challenging the executive order, one of a number of cases filed by people who had legal approval to enter the U.S. but were nevertheless detained at airports once they arrived.  The detentions sparked large protests at airports at major American cities, particularly over the plight of legal permanent residents, commonly called green-card holders, who were initially barred entry to the U.S. Officials have since said that green-card holders can return to the U.S. and that no green-card holders are still being detained."]
["U.S. News", "Also Friday, a federal judge in Boston sided with the Trump administration and said he wouldn\u2019t continue a temporary restraining order he had issued last week. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton isn\u2019t likely to have any immediate legal effect because court orders from other judges remain in effect. \u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.

The new administrator focused instead on his general aspirations for the agency, such as giving businesses certainty regarding environmental rules and striking an appropriate balance with states when it comes to regulations."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cRegulations ought to make things regular,\u201d said Mr. Pruitt, repeating a line he used at his confirmation hearing in January. \u201cThose that we regulate ought to know what they can expect from us.\u201d That is a clear difference in message and focus from the EPA under President Barack Obama,  which emphasized first what the agency was trying to protect with its regulations on clean air and water. Scott Pruitt, the nominee to head the Environmental Control Agency for the Trump administration, was questioned about his understanding of climate change and the role human activity and fossil fuels play in its progression by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I, Vt.) Photo: Getty. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s speech at agency headquarters, which went a little over 10 minutes, was aimed at striking a balance between the administrator\u2019s mandate from Mr. Trump to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental regulations and persistent concerns from inside and outside the agency about that very mandate. It didn\u2019t include questions from either media or the assembled EPA staffers in Washington. EPA employs about 15,000 people across the U.S.; thousands were able to watch the speech online.  \u201cYou can\u2019t lead unless you listen. I seek to listen and learn and lead with you to address these issues we face as a nation,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for EPA have attracted particular attention, given his stated goal of making wholesale changes at the agency. Current and former officials of the agency had publicly urged the defeat of Mr. Pruitt, saying they were concerned about his close relations with the oil and gas industry in Oklahoma. The Senate narrowly confirmed him on Friday mostly along party lines."]
["Politics and Policy", "Mr. Pruitt\u2019s comments Tuesday didn\u2019t ease some critics\u2019 concerns. \u201cPruitt told EPA staff they may not know him except for what they have read, but perception is reality,\u201d said Liz Purchia, a former EPA communications director under Mr. Obama. \u201cTrump\u2019s team spent the entire campaign and the last few months railing against EPA\u2019s existence, its staff and its purpose.\u201d Mr. Pruitt didn\u2019t mention the Trump administration\u2019s imminent plans to start undoing two of the biggest rules the agency has issued over the past eight years: one cutting carbon emissions from power plants and another bringing more waters under federal jurisdiction. Mr. Trump is expected to soon sign at least two executive orders to begin the process of scrapping both of those regulations, along with other Obama-era climate regulations, according to several people familiar with the plans. Both efforts would take months and are likely to face legal challenges. The executive order focusing on power-plant emissions is expected to be framed as an attempt to reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on foreign sources of energy while promoting domestic energy production, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises. Supporters of the regulation say it is important for fighting climate change. Other policies likely to be targeted in the executive orders is an Interior Department temporary ban on coal leasing and a measure cutting emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas, from oil and natural gas wells on federal lands. Congress is already in the process of repealing that regulation."]

["Olympics", "The flag has been on display in other Olympics but was shelved as tensions increased between the two countries in recent years. Its appearance again on Friday took on added poignancy with the Games being staged just a short drive from the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula. Throughout the Games, many South Korean fans rooting for the home team will be showcasing this unofficial national flag, which shows a blue silhouette of the Korean Peninsula atop a white background and has become a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. It will also be used to represent a joint Korean women\u2019s ice hockey team. However, because not all Koreans embrace that type of cooperation, the flag is also controversial in some quarters here. The flag\u2019s history dates to 1989, when the Koreas began discussing possible plans to form a joint team for international sports events. The idea was to improve ties between the communist North and democratic South against the backdrop of thawing East-West relations at the end of the Cold War. The design was a compromise, said Kim Young-mi, senior lecturer of Asian Studies at the University of Edinburgh. The South wanted a green silhouette while the North wanted yellow-brown: mix them together and you get blue. The flag was first used in 1991, when Seoul and Pyongyang created a joint table tennis team to compete in that year\u2019s world championship and a joint men\u2019s youth soccer team to play in the world tournament. Both squads played above expectations."]
["Olympics", "Figure skater Jason Brown demonstrates and explains the differences between the six jumps in every skater\u2019s arsenal. Photo: Adam Falk/The Wall Street Journal The flag survived into the 2000s when liberal governments in South Korea pursued a policy of engagement with North Korea. The two Koreas used the flag to march together at the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in 2000, 2004 and 2006. Before Friday, it was presented most recently at the 2007 Changchun Winter Asian Games. As relations worsened in the years that followed, the blue-and-white flag served as a reminder of better days. When a new liberal Seoul government eager to resume engagement with Pyongyang was elected last May, the flag became a symbol of the country\u2019s differing views on the subject.  Seoul\u2019s progressives say the flag is apolitical and helps ease tensions with Pyongyang by encouraging the idea that the two nations used to be one, and by widening a sports channel through which the two Koreas can communicate. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of moments when events could have quickly turned into war here in Korea,\u201d said Jang Ji-chang, a South Korean fan. \u201cBut every time, the flag has been a source of comfort for me.\u201d The Unified Korea delegation parades during the opening ceremony.Photo: javier soriano/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Seoul\u2019s conservatives say the flag delegitimizes the South Korean national flag, the taeguek-gi, which was used by one of the exile Korean governments as its flag during Japan\u2019s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945."]

And it used to mean peace in the early 1990s, but it\u2019s now something different because we\u2019re nuclear hostages of the North,\u201d said Cho Young-key, a North Korea scholar at Korea University. There\u2019s a final twist to the flag: Japan, Korea\u2019s neighbor, doesn\u2019t like it. A tiny blue dot on the right side of the flag represents Dokdo/Takeshima, a small island controlled by South Korea but claimed by Japan. Japan asked the Koreas to take the dot off and on Feb. 6 a Seoul foreign ministry spokesman said South Korea would agree to that request out of respect to International Olympic Committee recommendations to avoid political disputes during the Games. Ironically, North Korea has supported South Korea\u2019s claim toward the island. \u201cIt\u2019s funny.

Investors also were monitoring movement in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, because gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets such as Treasurys as borrowing costs rise.

["Markets Main", " OPEC\u2019s predicament underscores the powerful role global oil inventories now play, after years of being a technical detail that some traders ignored. With more data available than ever, oil storage has joined shale production as a symbol of a global glut of crude that has knocked OPEC on its heels. \u201cThe production deal was a risky maneuver by OPEC,\u201d said Antoine Halff,  senior researcher at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. \u201cBy choosing a storage target, they set themselves up for failure.\u201d Almost six months after OPEC\u2019s 13 members and 11 other heavyweight producers pledged to cut around 2% of global oil supply, stored crude has only recently begun falling and remains at historically high levels. Oil prices were up almost 1% at $51.12 a barrel on Monday but remain below the levels reached in the days after the production cut\u2019s announcement and short of the $60 a barrel target that Saudi Arabia wants. OPEC leaders say they want to reduce storage levels in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a club of industrialized countries like the U.S.\u2014to a five-year average. About 550 million barrels of crude and oil products have been added to the world\u2019s stocks since 2014, when prices began crashing, said Christopher Bake,  a member of the executive committee at the world\u2019s largest oil trader Vitol Group. OPEC leaders have said they want to siphon off over 300 million barrels of crude oil from OECD stocks, which reached record highs of over 3 billion barrels last year."]
["Markets Main", "But OECD stocks continued increasing in early 2017 and fell in March by just 32 million barrels, according to the International Energy Agency, a global adviser to oil-consuming places such as the U.S., India and Europe. Even if the OPEC and non-OPEC cuts are extended into the second half of 2017, stocks won\u2019t draw down to the five-year average this year, the IEA said. An OPEC official said the group\u2019s plan was beginning to work and merely needed more time.   \u201cStocks are now coming down,\u201d the official said. The official said OPEC was also concerned about high inventories in 2008 and 2009, when the global economic crisis depressed demand and prices, sending storage levels higher. Storage levels eventually fell, and prices rose, in 2009 as the crisis abated and oil demand growth returned. OPEC focus on storage levels came after the cartel was humbled by U.S. shale production\u2019s ability to withstand low prices. Now the group has found that its power to flush oil out of storage is also limited. One of the main culprits might be OPEC itself\u2014the group ramped up output just before the cuts were slated to start in January, adding to the world\u2019s already vast oversupply. According to data from oil-tanker tracking firm Kpler, OPEC\u2019s January to April exports were in line with the same period last year, meaning just as much oil has hit the global market after the cuts. \u201cOPEC itself delayed reaching the inventories goal by increasing production late last year,\u201d said Olivier Jakob, managing director of consultancy Petromatrix."]
["Markets Main", "OECD storage is only a slice of what investors are looking at. More than half of the world\u2019s oil refining capacity is now outside of the OECD, in countries like China and India, where accurate storage data is difficult to come by. China made significant inventory drawdowns early in the year followed by large inventory builds to recover to an oil stock level of 783 million barrels as of May 17, according to data from global storage monitoring firm Ursa Space Systems Inc., which monitors 75% of China\u2019s storage capacity  Saudi Arabia\u2019s stocks rose by 2.3%, or 6 million barrels, over February and March, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative, a group based in Riyadh that compiles oil industry information. According to Kpler, stocks appear to be falling in major oil storage hubs in the Caribbean and South Africa. There is also less oil being held in giant tankers at sea, an expensive way to hoard oil but one that became common during the glut. According to Kpler, the volume of oil held on ships had fallen around 23% from December to 91.1 million barrels at the end of April. \u201cIf they continue to fall, that will give the market some new confidence,\u201d said Harry Tchilinguirian,  head of commodity markets strategy at\n            BNP Paribas\n.\n But there are some ominous signs for OPEC and any extended bet to reduce oil storage. \u2014Summer Said and Margherita Stancati contributed to this article."]

In the arena, even one victory for the inter-Korean women\u2019s ice-hockey team would be a coup for Pyongyang\u2014especially if it comes against rival Japan.

The opening ceremony alone will present plenty of potential for drama. Mr. Pence will be there, as will North Korea\u2019s nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam. The seating arrangement could allow for an encounter\u2014planned or otherwise\u2014between the two. It is also possible that Ms. Kim could attend the opening ceremony. The 2018 Winter Olympics are bigger and more extreme than ever before, as death-defying sports make their way into the lineup. So how did we get here?"]
["Asia News", "The North\u2019s involvement in the Games allows it to try to cast itself as something of a peacemaker, despite its continued pledges to bolster its arsenal of nuclear weapons. The U.S. and South Korea recently agreed to postpone joint military exercises until after the Paralympics end in mid-March, citing the need to concentrate on security arrangements for the Games. For skeptics of Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions, this has turned the Pyeongchang Olympics into the \u201cPyongyang Olympics\u201d\u2014a phrase that South Korea\u2019s main conservative opposition party has deployed in recent weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how completely Kim Jong Un is controlling the agenda,\u201d said Aidan Foster-Carter,  an honorary senior research fellow and Korea expert at Leeds University in the U.K. By opening the door to dialogue, Kim Jong Un has turned the world's biggest sporting event into a political weapon. WSJ looks at why the Winter Games are so important to Pyongyang. Defenders of South Korea\u2019s president say that if allowing Mr. Kim to bask in a propaganda win is the price needed to ensure a peaceful Olympics free of North Korean military threats, it is a price worth paying. \u201cAs recently as the end of last year, it was unimaginable that South and North Korea would enter the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics together,\u201d read an editorial praising the rapprochement, in Hankyoreh, South Korea\u2019s main left-leaning newspaper. A hint of North Korea\u2019s charm offensive came in the early rounds of inter-Korean dialogue last month, when Pyongyang sent its best-known pop singer to the talks."]
["Asia News", " The appearance of Hyon Song Wol at the negotiating table and then on an inspection of concert venues caused a flurry of excitement in South Korea, where her every move was broadcast on national TV. The image could turn once the Games are under way, if there are defections from the North Korean delegation or protests against the regime by athletes or others. South Korean conservatives have already met the North Koreans\u2019 arrival with protests, burning the North\u2019s flag and effigies of Mr. Kim. The last time South Korea hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, Pyongyang made several efforts to co-host events but was rebuffed, and blew up a South Korean airliner in the lead-up to the Games. The 2018 Games could provide a display of the gap that has continued to widen between this thriving democracy and the impoverished dictatorship next door. The last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, North Korea was shut out and blew up a South Korean airliner, killing over 100 people.

The bill would implement the first part of the two-year budget deal passed last month, the third such agreement lawmakers have struck to wriggle out of spending curbs passed in 2011."]
["Politics and Policy", "Lawmakers will now have only two days to consider and pass the 2,232-page bill before the government\u2019s current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Debates over immigration policy, health-care markets, gun control and infrastructure funding had all complicated the negotiations, which added days of delay to the bill\u2019s release. \u201cNo bill of this size is perfect,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said in a statement Wednesday night. \u201cBut this legislation addresses important priorities and makes us stronger at home and abroad.\u201d Lawmakers and President Donald Trump agreed to the bill\u2019s $1.3 trillion funding level last month as part of a two-year budget deal. As part of that agreement, the bill unveiled Wednesday night would boost defense spending by $80 billion and domestic spending by $63 billion above limits set in 2011. Democratic leaders applauded the bill\u2019s boost for domestic priorities, including funding increases for the National Institutes of Health, Head Start and child-care programs, opioid research and treatment, veterans\u2019 health care and infrastructure. \u201cFrom opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a statement Wednesday night. The bill\u2019s delayed release means that House GOP leaders will likely have to waive the chamber\u2019s normal requirements for how long a bill must be public before a vote. Many lawmakers criticized the back-room negotiations that produced the bill, leaving them with less than 24 hours before a House vote expected Thursday, with a Senate vote to follow."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cThis whole process is an embarrassment and as bad as it looks to the American people from the outside, you ought to see it from the inside,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.) The spending bill will face fresh hurdles in the Senate, where any one senator can block the chamber from speeding up its time-consuming procedures, as Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) did last month over the two-year budget deal. Mr. Paul said Wednesday he hadn\u2019t yet decided how he would act this week. The bill ends\u2014for now\u2014one of the most contentious fights between Democrats and Mr. Trump, by including $1.57 billion for construction of physical barriers on the border with Mexico and other security measures. Mr. Trump won funding for 33 miles of new fencing on the Texas border\u2014about half of what he requested. He also got funding for 60 miles of replacement or secondary fencing, which is built alongside existing barriers. That is more than he asked for but is also far less controversial. \u201cGot $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet late Wednesday. \u201cHad to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\u201d White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that Mr. Trump \u201csupports the bill\u201d and \u201clooks forward to signing it.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "Democrats won a number of concessions, particularly regarding immigration enforcement inside the U.S. The bill provides for minimal or no increases to enforcement officers and detention bed space and no punishments for sanctuary cities. In addition, the new border construction must use designs now in use, which rules out a solid concrete wall. Some conservatives, upset that the bill didn\u2019t include more funding for the wall, urged Mr. Trump to veto the bill. The White House said Mr. Trump had discussed the spending bill with Mr. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The bill doesn\u2019t actually fund a full 100 miles of border construction, even when replacement fencing is counted. The spending bill included some of the first legislative steps to rein in gun violence, after a string of recent mass shootings. The legislation includes a measure from Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) to strengthen compliance with the national background check system for buying firearms. The bill would also end what gun-control advocates say has effectively been a ban on federal gun-violence research. Those two changes \u201cwould be a very big deal, especially in the context of a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican White House,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). Meanwhile, the bill didn\u2019t end a dispute over how to pay for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River connecting New York and New Jersey. The project\u2019s supporters say the federal government should pay for half of the project\u2019s $12.7 billion cost; the Trump administration says New York and New Jersey should pay for the majority of the work."]
["Politics and Policy", "The spending legislation would provide $650 million to Amtrak for track improvements along its busy Northeast Corridor, an increase of $322 million from 2017, and direct $2.9 billion to discretionary grant programs, to which Amtrak and its partners plan to apply for funds to support the tunnel work. The agreement ruffled conservatives, who wanted to see less funding for the tunnel and more for the border wall. \u201cIt is troubling when we get a tunnel and we don\u2019t get a wall,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three-dozen conservatives, which said Wednesday night that it opposed the bill. \u201cThe last time I checked, the president didn\u2019t make any promises about getting a tunnel at any of his campaign stops.\u201d. \u201cThe last time I checked, the president didn\u2019t make any promises about getting a tunnel at any of his campaign stops.\u201d Congressional leaders included funding to strengthen election security to thwart Russian meddling in November\u2019s midterm elections. Several fights were too thorny to be resolved in this bill. No funding was included to help stabilize the Affordable Care Act markets, after Mr. Trump cut off subsidies to insurers last year. And lawmakers didn\u2019t agree on any extension of the Obama-era program shielding young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. Mr. Trump ended that program and gave Congress until early March to pass its replacement. But lawmakers and the White House failed to break an impasse over what immigration measures to pair with an extension of the program, disappointing many Democrats who had wanted to use their leverage to end the Dreamers\u2019 uncertainty."]

(Originally published Oct. 13, 2017) Under the 2015 nuclear agreement, the U.S. agreed to waive sanctions against Iran that are contained in a series of U.S. laws. The waivers for each law must renewed periodically to extend the sanctions relief.  Beginning this week, Mr. Trump was facing a series of waiver deadlines and needed to approve them to keep the U.S. commitments in place under the nuclear accord. They were the first such deadlines since he declined in October to certify to Congress that Iran was complying with the terms of the accord. He said at that time that he would leave the accord if European allies and U.S. lawmakers failed to take steps to fix the deal, but didn\u2019t set a deadline. Since then, there has been some progress in negotiations between the White House and Sens. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.) on an amendment to 2015 legislation that allows for congressional oversight over the deal. The amendment would address some of Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about the deal, including limits on nuclear behavior that expire over time."]

The ban would be the first step against the Venezuelan financial system since Mr. Trump promised \u201cswift economic action\u201d against Mr. Maduro for installing a parallel parliament staffed with loyalists earlier this month. Up to now, the progressive waves of U.S. sanctions have targeted dozens of Venezuelan officials, banning them from traveling to the U.S. and freezing any assets in the country for alleged human rights abuses and corruption. On Wednesday, Vice President Michael Pence is scheduled to speak to Venezuelan expatriates in Miami. The ban is designed to damage Mr. Maduro\u2019s support among military officers and government contractors who hold Venezuelan bonds, without immediately hurting the wider population, said the person briefed on the matter. Mr. Maduro\u2019s government has continued making bond payments despite undergoing the world\u2019s deepest recession, rewarding risk-tolerant investors with the world\u2019s highest yields.

During the first half of 2017, deflation was banished, debt defaults slowed, and growth rebounded. Nonetheless, China watchers have long warned that tighter credit would eventually mean slowing growth again. This month, the first real evidence of that arrived: China\u2019s official purchasing managers index was sharply lower than expected, and July industrial-production and retail-sales data released Monday were the weakest since February. Investment growth was the weakest since December. A worker at the construction site in China, where industrial-production growth has slowed.Photo: Yu Fangping/Zuma Press The slowdown may catch some investors off guard. After buoyant second-quarter data, sentiment on China is at its most bullish in years. China growth plays like miners and construction-equipment firms will probably sell off on the news. But the very gradual ramp down in credit growth\u2014far softer than in previous tightening cycles\u2014still likely means a moderate, rather than drastic, economic slowdown in the closing months of 2017."]
["Heard on the Street", "The weakness revealed by Monday\u2019s numbers was broad-based\u2014with the notable exception of the steel sector, where growth continues to accelerate in the wake of capacity cuts, which have helped to boost margins. Real estate and infrastructure investment both weakened, with the former growing at its slowest pace since June 2016. Growth in China\u2019s massive information-technology sector\u2014a good indicator of export strength\u2014also slowed, in line with July\u2019s PMI, which showed growth in new export orders weakening abruptly. Combined with the weak retail-sales data, this isn\u2019t encouraging news. There are, however, two big reasons to expect a mild rather than sharp slowdown. The first and most important is credit growth, which nearly always leads the overall growth trajectory in China. Here the news is good: In contrast to past tightening cycles in 2010 and 2013, the slowdown in credit growth has been quite mild. Growth in total debt-and-equity finance outstanding for households and nonfinancial firms, including local government bonds, has only slowed by around 2 to 3 percentage points since its early 2016 peak. By contrast, at this point in the previous tightening cycle, credit growth had already slowed by nearly 6 percentage points.

With her ruling, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema added another judicial roadblock to the president that is similar to court orders issued elsewhere, including a nationwide ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco.

With her ruling, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema added another judicial roadblock to the president that is similar to court orders issued elsewhere, including a nationwide ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco.  Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news. Judge Brinkema said the government has provided \u201cno evidence\u201d to justify the order, which temporarily barred visitors and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. The administration argues it was needed to stop terrorists from entering the country."]
["Politics and Policy", "Critics say the executive order discriminates against Muslims and is an extension of Mr. Trump\u2019s call on the campaign trail for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Judge Brinkema cited similar comments in her order. \u201cThe \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 was a centerpiece of the president\u2019s campaign for months,\u201d and is still available on his website, she wrote. The government has argued the executive order is a valid exercise of the president\u2019s authority to control immigration. But Judge Brinkema said that while Mr. Trump may have broad power over immigration, he still must operate within \u201cthe constraints of the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights. \u201cMaximum power does not mean absolute power,\u201d she wrote. The case was brought by the Virginia attorney general\u2019s office.  Although both the Ninth Circuit ruling and Judge Brinkema\u2019s decision take aim at the executive order, they differ in important ways. The Ninth Circuit ruling was national in scope, and it covered additional parts of the order that suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months and blocked refugees from Syria indefinitely. In contrast, Judge Brinkema\u2019s ruling covers only Virginia, and only the section of the order suspending entry from the seven specified countries. The Ninth Circuit also focused on the question of whether the executive order violated due process, saying those challenging the order were likely to succeed in arguing that it did. Judge Brinkema, by contrast, tackled the issue of religious discrimination, and says the plaintiffs are likely to win on that."]
["Politics and Policy", "Neither ruling, however, amounts to a direct decision on the underlying legality of the executive order. Instead, they suspend the measure while its fundamental merits can be considered by the courts, a process that could take months. The result is a complicated legal landscape, though one that has clearly been unfriendly to Mr. Trump\u2019s order so far.

On Thursday outside the courthouse, Ms. Arroyo-Maultsby, who was excused to attend a cruise for a family wedding, said she would have voted to acquit Mr. Menendez. She said most jurors think the defendants aren\u2019t guilty, including three jurors who are absolutely convinced. Another group is equally firm on the other side, she said. On Monday, after Judge Walls and the attorneys met individually with four jurors and three alternates, the judge decided, over the objections of defense attorneys, that deliberations would proceed. If the jury continues to be unable to agree on a verdict, Judge Walls could declare a mistrial due to a hung jury. The outcome of the trial could affect the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. If convicted, Mr. Menendez could be forced to step down from his Senate seat by a two-thirds majority vote of the chamber. Until Jan. 16, outgoing Republican Gov.

Those airlines\u2014Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways\u2014are already embroiled in a three-year old trade dispute with the three largest U.S. carriers, including\n            Delta Air Lines\n Inc.\n Mr. Isakson, a longtime politician from Atlanta, home to Delta, said his proposal was intended to boost fairness and competition. \u201cForeign airlines should not receive preferential tax treatment if their countries choose not to open their markets to U.S. companies,\u201d he said in a statement. A proposal in the Senate tax-overhaul bill would require airlines based in 14 nations or territories to pay U.S. corporate taxes on a portion of their profits: Critics said, however, it would hurt a system that has allowed airlines to operate international flights without having to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions.

["Business", "United and Delta recently dropped their daily flights to Dubai, flights that didn\u2019t attract many passengers and fared poorly against the big connecting hubs operated by their Persian Gulf carriers in their home markets. The proposed measure would need to pass the full Senate, then survive a reconciliation process with a House bill that lacks such language.  In addition to the three big Persian Gulf carriers, the proposed tax change would hit airlines in a dozen other nations including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Fiji, Ethiopia and Malaysia, according to the people familiar with the proposed provision. That is because the language would apply to nations that don\u2019t have full-fledged tax treaties with the U.S., and those that don\u2019t attract at least two weekly round-trip flights by U.S. passenger airlines. A spokeswoman for Mr. Isakson said the tax provision could raise $200 million in revenue from foreign airlines. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the amendment would yield $100 million through 2022 and $200 million over a decade. The trade spat with the three Persian Gulf carriers was started in 2015 by Delta, American Airlines Group Inc., and United Continental Holdings Inc. They have asked the U.S. government to amend its so-called open-skies air treaties with the U.A.E. and Qatar, alleging that the three carriers in those nations are backed by billions of dollars in state subsidies that allow them to expand without thought to earning a profit."]
["Business", "Such open-skies agreements have been negotiated by the U.S. and more than 120 other countries over the past 25 years. They give airlines on both sides unfettered access to the other\u2019s countries and the ability to freely set prices and schedules. The three Gulf carriers have denied they are subsidized and claim the U.S. airlines are being protectionist. Other U.S. passenger and cargo carriers have urged the U.S. government to stay out of the Gulf-airlines dispute and maintain its open skies strategy. American, Delta and United declined to comment on the tax amendment, as did Emirates. Qatar Airways didn\u2019t respond.

Both companies indeed reported stronger revenues from their respective smartphone businesses during 2017. But unit sales were largely flat with the year before, indicating that many consumers weren\u2019t sold enough on the latest enhancements to cough up the extra dough."]
["Heard on the Street", "Samsung, for its part, seems to be trying a slightly different tack this time: The company unveiled its new top-of-the-line Galaxy S9 smartphone Sunday at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain. The device features the same eye-catching design of last year\u2019s Galaxy, including a curved edge-to-edge display, along with notable enhancements to the phone\u2019s camera and some other internal improvements. One thing Samsung doesn\u2019t appear to be changing is the price, which will be in the mid-to-high $700s, depending on the carrier. The Galaxy S9 goes on sale next month. Keeping prices level could help Samsung to get more of its users to buy its latest devices. The same could hold true for Apple if it chooses to follow a similar strategy with its new iPhones expected later this year. Apple and Samsung both face growing competition globally from Chinese companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi. But combined, the two giants still account for more than one-third of the world\u2019s smartphone sales, giving them a significant impact across the globe. That impact was felt last year. According to IDC, about 1.472 billion smartphones sold globally in 2017, a very slight decline from the 1.473 billion sold the year before. That was still the first decline ever by an industry that had averaged about 26% growth over the previous five years. That decline came during a year of major enhancements offered up by Apple, Samsung and other device makers. Market-research firm Gartner also reported a 5.6% fall in smartphone unit sales during the typically strong fourth quarter, with analyst Anshul Gupta noting that \u201chigh expectations and few incremental benefits\u201d helped weaken demand during the period."]
["Heard on the Street", "Today\u2019s high-end smartphone market is officially a mature one. That means the market depends far more on upgrades than it does on new customers. And those upgrades will happen less frequently as higher prices keep customers holding on to their phones longer\u2014especially when annual enhancements don\u2019t change much about the basic form and function of top-end devices.

The way markets are being priced suggests there is just such a mismatch\u2014and even if nothing bad happens, investors could still be disappointed. The near-universal expectation is that inflation will stay low, central banks will be cautious about tightening monetary policy, corporate debt costs will stay low and profit margins will stay high.

It was part of an operation by\n            Amazon.com\n Inc.\n      itself, which is laying the groundwork for its own shipping business in a brazen challenge to America\u2019s freight titans."]
["Technology", "Tackling the delivery business, Amazon executives publicly say, is a logical way to add delivery capacity\u2014particularly during the peak Christmas season. But interviews with nearly two dozen current and former Amazon managers and business partners indicate the retailer has grander ambitions than it has publicly acknowledged. Amazon\u2019s goal, these people say, is to one day haul and deliver packages for itself as well as other retailers and consumers\u2014potentially upending the traditional relationship between seller and sender. Some executives refer to the initiative as \u201cConsume the City,\u201d a nod to the company\u2019s plans to build a massive delivery network that could eventually compete with such partners as UPS, according to people familiar the matter. Executives at the freight giants are skeptical, and so are analysts and logistics experts. They say it would be difficult and costly to build a domestic delivery network to rival the big U.S. players, especially after the failed multibillion-dollar attempt by\n            Deutsche Post\n AG\u2019s\n      DHL Express in the 2000s. Memphis-based FedEx says it is spending more than $5 billion annually on expansion and upgrades; UPS says it shells out in excess of $2.5 billion. The two companies have managed to blanket the world with a total of roughly 4,000 hubs and other facilities to sort tens of millions of packages a day. Combined, they operate more than 1,000 planes and 200,000 vehicles to deliver packages to doors."]
["Technology", "\u201cThe level of global investment in facilities, sorting, aircraft, vehicles, people to replicate the service we provide, or our primary competitor provides, is just daunting, and frankly, in our view, unrealistic,\u201d says FedEx CFO Alan Graf. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years.\u201d Atlanta-based UPS has played down any competitive threat. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Commercial Officer Alan Gershenhorn said UPS\u2019s network would be \u201cvery difficult to match.\u201d In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesman said \u201cwe are very happy to have the delivery capacity our carrier partners can provide. They provide a high quality service, and our own delivery efforts are needed to supplement that capacity rather than replace it.\u201d Inside the company, executives describe, in the words of one senior official, how Amazon \u201cis building a full-service logistics and transportation network effectively from the ground up.\u201d Amazon\u2019s push into the shipping sector reflects a willingness among today\u2019s powerful tech companies to defy the traditional constraints of business and leap into new ones. The company, which started out as an online bookseller, has gained credibility as a producer of TV programs and big-screen movies. Amazon Web Services, which provides data servers to big companies, is now its fastest-growing division with at least $10 billion in sales expected this year. Now the stage is set for Amazon to move against the partners that have helped power much of its success so far. Shipping costs as a percentage of sales have risen every year since 2009. Last year, Amazon spent $11.5 billion on shipping, or 10.8% of sales, compared with 7.5% in 2010. Total revenue for the year was $107 billion."]
["Technology", "The company could save $1.1 billion annually if it stopped using UPS and FedEx, according to\n            Citigroup\n Inc.\n      analysts. Keeping packages under its own control just over longer distances could save Amazon around $3 or more on a typical delivery, the analysts say. The average cost to ship a package via UPS or FedEx is $7.81, they estimate.  Amazon currently delivers its own packages from roughly 70 facilities in 21 states, having built most of them in the past two years, according to data from supply-chain consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Today, 44% of the U.S. populace is within 20 miles of an Amazon facility, compared with 5% in 2010, according to investment bank Piper Jaffray.  All of this helps to explain why Amazon wants more control over its delivery chain\u2014from factories in China through U.S. ports to sprawling suburban warehouses and neighborhood package-sorting centers. It hopes to offer more delivery times, including hours not available from traditional carriers, say people familiar with the plan. The cost of such a system isn\u2019t known.  To help oversee its delivery projects, Amazon this summer brought back Uber Technologies Inc. executive Tim Collins as a vice president of global logistics. Mr. Collins spent 16 years at Amazon, helping to lead the retailer\u2019s European operations, before leaving the company in late 2014 to join Uber. "]
["Technology", "Amazon has also recruited dozens of UPS and FedEx executives and hundreds of other UPS workers in recent years, say people familiar with the matter. The company is buying long-haul truck trailers to ship by ground, building delivery drones to conquer the sky and looking to manage shipping by sea. In August, it showed off the first in a fleet of 40\n            Boeing\n            \n      767-300s it is leasing for its branded Prime Air logistics service.  In Seattle, Amazon.com boxes were stacked near a Boeing 767 Amazon \u2018Prime Air\u2019 cargo plane. Photo: Ted S. Warren/Associated Press Stitching together a full-fledged logistics network could give Amazon a piece of a world-wide delivery market that, according to financial services firm Robert W. Baird, generates roughly $400 billion in annual revenue. It could also damage its relationships with UPS and FedEx. Amazon contributes around $1 billion to UPS\u2019s revenue, according to people familiar with the matter. Perhaps more important, the retail giant\u2019s heft helps both UPS and FedEx to be more cost effective by allowing drivers to drop off more packages in the same areas. If Amazon pulls too much business from the delivery giants, the carriers could respond by eliminating certain volume discounts.  Amazon already has pushed out some smaller parcel carriers. In the past two years, it has parted ways with or started reducing package volumes at several local and regional delivery partners, according to people familiar with the matter."]
["Technology", "Currently, Amazon is focused on solving the riddle of the so-called last mile\u2014the final and most expensive leg of a package\u2019s journey to the doorstep. To make last-mile deliveries profitable, logistics experts say, companies need shorter drives and more packages per stop. Amazon, they say, doesn\u2019t yet have enough consumer deliveries to hit this threshold. The company is conducting its trials in large cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami. Those places have a high density of members who belong to Amazon\u2019s $99-per-year Prime unlimited shipping program. Gnarled traffic in those cities\u2014especially in Los Angeles\u2014also tests drivers\u2019 mettle and speediness. Amazon is building more warehouses, like the one shown here In Inglewood, Calif.Photo: Emily Berl for The Wall Street Journal As part of its efforts, Amazon is making some deliveries using only trucks and infrastructure it oversees, people familiar with the matter say. The retailer also has begun distributing boxes and packaging materials to a small number of Los Angeles customers so they, too, can use Amazon as a delivery service, the people say. The test helps ensure Amazon\u2019s trucks aren\u2019t empty when they return to warehouses and give customers more incentive to keep ordering from Amazon. Amazon embarked in earnest on building its own last-mile network after UPS failed to bring orders to customers in time for Christmas in 2013, costing Amazon millions of dollars in refunds, according to people familiar with the matter. That holiday season, Amazon overwhelmed UPS and other carriers after it failed to accurately forecast its delivery needs, prompting chaos at sorting centers."]
["Technology", "Since then, Amazon has more than doubled the number of warehouses in the U.S. to more than 180, according to MWPVL. That includes more than 70 local delivery stations and Prime Now hubs within reach of nearly every major metropolitan area. In many of those areas, Amazon can deliver merchandise in as little as one hour after receiving an order. Amazon-branded vans are increasingly turning up in big cities like Los Angeles. Photo: Emily Berl for The Wall Street Journal Just a few years ago, if an Amazon Prime customer in Atlanta ordered a $13 set of beer glasses only available from California, Amazon would load that order, with others, onto a tractor trailer and haul it to the closest UPS air hub. Next, a plane might ferry it to Louisville, Ky., and load it onto another flight bound for Atlanta. Then the package would be trucked to the nearest delivery center, sorted a final time and delivered by a UPS van. Such a journey could wipe out any profit for Amazon. The company now aims to do more of the steering. If those glasses aren\u2019t in stock at a fulfillment center near Atlanta, it could fly them there in its own planes and then pay the Postal Service to ship them a shorter distance. Or, contract drivers could make final delivery. Amazon has flirted with delivery by Uber drivers and newspaper carriers. It has experimented with a program known as \u201cI Have Space,\u201d stashing inventory in warehouses owned by other companies. "]
["Technology", "A more established program called Flex hires so-called citizen-couriers, who work as freelance delivery people to pick up packages from warehouses using an Amazon app. It has expanded to nearly 30 metropolitan areas in the last year. Drivers can earn up to $25 an hour in two-hour shifts making deliveries, according to Amazon\u2019s website. Some Amazon executives believe that the on-demand contract driver model, which passes along fuel and insurance costs, could eventually become an important part of the company\u2019s network. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s last-mile effort has become particularly visible in San Francisco\u2019s relatively compact confines. Just two years ago, workers loaded rented delivery vans with packages from a modified trailer in a parking lot beside Candlestick Park, the former football stadium. Today, hundreds of Amazon-branded white trucks, dispatched from a giant warehouse near the airport, troll the city\u2019s winding streets\u2014even on Sundays.

["Markets Main", "Mr. Sanger, 71, will leave after a tumultuous period presiding over the board\u2019s response to the fake-account scandal that last year led to the departure of former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. Mr. Sanger, a former\n            General Mills\n Inc.\n      CEO, is one of three directors who will retire at the end of 2017, the company said.  The other two are Cynthia Milligan and Susan Swenson,  both of whom joined the board in the 1990s. Mr. Sanger would have hit the board\u2019s mandatory retirement age next year and is stepping down about four months early.

Mr. Pujadas recently retired from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the accounting giant where he had been a principal and held numerous senior roles.\u00a0Some of the coming changes were outlined in a Wall Street Journal article last week. Wells Fargo, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has spent most of the past year trying to put last fall\u2019s sales-practices scandal behind it. Employees of the bank opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge, sparking public and political outcries as well as numerous investigations.  More recently, the bank has said even more customer accounts may have been impacted. It also is facing new problems in its auto-lending unit over insurance policies potentially involving thousands of borrowers. The bank has said it would reimburse customers for around $80 million."]

What...\n This isn\u2019t the kind of victory that Recep Tayyip Erdogan wanted. Turkey\u2019s president, after all, has long enjoyed most of the executive powers that he formally obtained in Sunday\u2019s vote on constitutional changes. His role as head of the country\u2019s governing party, with its pliant parliamentary majority, ensured that real authority was already concentrated in the presidential palace. What Mr. Erdogan needed, after the July coup attempt against him, was a public affirmation of his leadership\u2014and of his drive to root out dissent. That drive saw hundreds of thousands of opponents, including most leaders of the second-largest opposition party in parliament, hounded from their jobs or thrown behind bars."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "With the broadcast media under tight state control and \u201cNo\u201d campaigners branded by government officials as traitors or terrorists, Mr. Erdogan\u2019 aides just a few weeks ago confidently predicted that \u201cYes\u201d would carry the referendum by 60% or more. Instead, despite all the intimidation and the widespread reports of fraud during Sunday\u2019s vote, the preliminary results, as released by Anadolu state news agency, showed \u201cYes\u201d barely eking it out at 51.2% versus 48.8%.  That didn\u2019t deter Mr. Erdogan from issuing congratulations on the victory. \u201cThe entire country has triumphed,\u201d he said, calling for an end to \u201cunnecessary discussions.\u201d  In a speech to a crowd of supporters gathered under the rain in front of the ruling party\u2019s headquarters, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim described the vote as providing a popular mandate for Mr. Erdogan. \u201cIt\u2019s a turning point in the history of our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cAgainst the traitors and dividers we stood united as a nation.\u201d Yet, instead of cementing Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authority, such a thin\u2014and contested\u2014margin may end up threatening his ability to govern unchallenged in the months to come. \u201cErdogan may discover that this is a Pyrrhic victory,\u201d said Henri Barkey,  director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cHe may have won now, but he may find that in the medium term opposition to him at home and abroad may harden.\u201d"]
["Middle East Crossroads", "Turkey\u2019s opposition politicians have already claimed that massive fraud has occurred, particularly in the ruling party\u2019s strongholds in rural Anatolia and in the war-ravaged Kurdish areas of southeast Turkey. These complaints are likely to further delegitimize the result in the eyes of many Turks opposed to Mr. Erdogan. \u201cIt\u2019s the first election in which people have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the process,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas,  senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThis means nothing gets solved, and this remains a deeply polarized and divided country. That\u2019s a very dangerous place to be in.\u201d With opposition parties formally challenging a significant proportion of the ballots, fraud claims have the potential to dominate the aftermath of the vote. With Mr. Erdogan in firm control of security amid the continuing state of emergency, it is unlikely\u2014but not impossible\u2014that such a belief that the referendum was stolen could also translate into a new wave of street protests. One of the reasons why the Turkish government expected a much more solid victory is because Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or AKP, secured the backing of the leadership of the nationalist MHP party for his constitutional changes. Together, the two parties gained more than 61% of the vote in the latest parliamentary elections, in November 2015\u2014significantly more than \u201cYes\u201d scored on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible result for him,\u201d said Timur Kuran,  a professor at Duke University. \u201cWhat this indicates is that there are considerable shares of the nationalist and AKP votes that don\u2019t want Erdogan to have dictatorial powers.\u201d"]
["Middle East Crossroads", "Ominously for Mr. Erdogan, both Istanbul, his hometown and the city where he launched his political career as a popular mayor, and capital Ankara, home to Turkey\u2019s bureaucracy, sided with \u201cNo.\u201d So did several other major cities, such as Izmir, Adana and Antalya. \u201cIt is significant that Turkey\u2019s dynamic economic centers have rejected the centralized presidential system,\u201d said Aykan Erdemir, a former Turkish opposition lawmaker and a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe message is clear: Erdogan\u2019s one-man rule could be politically viable in the short run, but it may not be sustainable economically.\u201d  Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

["Technology", "Yahoo said it believes that the hackers are no longer in its corporate network. The company said it didn't believe that unprotected passwords, payment-card data or bank-account information had been affected. Computer users have grown inured to notices that a tech company, retailer or other company with which they have done business had been hacked. But the Yahoo disclosure is significant because the company said it was the work of another nation, and because it raises questions about the fate of the $4.8 billion Verizon deal, which was announced on July 25.  In July, Yahoo began investigating claims by hackers who were offering to sell what they said were 280 million Yahoo usernames and passwords. Yahoo said it concluded the information for sale wasn't legitimate, but the company decided to broaden its probe, eventually determining that it had been breached by \u201ca state-sponsored actor.\u201d In a proxy filing related to the Verizon deal on Sept. 9, Yahoo said it wasn't aware of any \u201csecurity breaches\u201d or \u201closs, theft, unauthorized access or acquisition\u201d of user data. Yahoo declined to comment on the filing.  Yahoo didn\u2019t say how the hackers broke into its network or which country sponsored the attacks. The intrusion, in late 2014, came during a period when many computer attacks, including on the federal Office of Personnel Management and health insurer\n            Anthem\n Inc.\n      were believed to be the work of China. More recent hacks, however, including of the Democratic National Committee earlier this year, have been blamed on Russia. Both countries have denied involvement in the hacks. "]
["Technology", "It isn\u2019t uncommon for data breaches to go unreported for years. In May, Myspace notified users of a 2013 breach; the same month,\n        LinkedIn\n Corp.\n      also notified users that a 2012 incident, thought to have affected just 6.5 million accounts, had actually compromised more than 100 million. \u201cThe FBI is aware of the intrusion and investigating the matter,\u201d the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. \u201cWe take these types of breaches very seriously and will determine how this occurred and who is responsible.\u201d Verizon said it was notified of the breach earlier this week. \u201cWe understand that Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact,\u201d Verizon said in a statement. \u201cWe will evaluate as the investigation continues.\u201d B. Riley & Co. analyst Sameet Sinha said the breach is unlikely to affect terms of the Verizon deal. \u201cData breaches have become part of doing business now,\u201d he said, adding that\n            Microsoft\n Corp.\n      agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June, one month after LinkedIn notified users of the broader scope of its 2012 breach. But Stephen S. Wu, a technology lawyer at the Silicon Valley Law Group, said the language assuring that no security breaches had occurred might give Verizon leverage to renegotiate the deal, or even to walk away."]
["Technology", "The Yahoo breach appears to be the largest ever disclosed, based on the number of users affected, said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearing House, a not-for-profit group that compiles information on data breaches. Credit-card processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc. said roughly 130 million credit- and debit-card numbers had been stolen in a 2009 hack. The Yahoo breach, and the timing of the disclosure, quickly reverberated in Washington. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement, \u201cI am perhaps most troubled by news that this breach occurred in 2014, and yet the public is only learning details of it today.\u201d Yahoo\u2019s breach is the latest in a series of compromises that have put billions of consumer usernames and email addresses at risk. One website, called Leaked Source, sells a searchable list of more than two billion credentials. While many other companies have disclosed large-scale breaches recently, the fact that Yahoo is linking its hack to state-sponsored hackers is noteworthy. U.S. intelligence officials have said China-based attacks have declined in recent months, following a 2015 agreement between the U.S. and China. Over the past year, Russia has gradually taken China\u2019s place as the primary suspect of attacks on U.S. systems. Two hacking groups\u2014linked by security researchers and U.S. government officials to Russia\u2014have published email messages belonging to public figures, including private Gmail messages belonging to former Secretary of State Colin Powell."]
["Technology", "The Yahoo data could be used to obtain the personal correspondence of public figures. \u201cFor a government, the real value would be to look for people with real value,\u201d said Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t get classified information, but some of those Colin Powell emails were very interesting.\u201d Yahoo said the stolen passwords were encrypted, but computer-security experts said a determined attacker could unscramble passwords\u2014especially simple passwords\u2014using commonly available \u201ccracking\u201d software. Once cracked, hackers could break into Yahoo accounts and\u2014if the password happened to be reused on another web service\u2014possibly other websites too. Security experts recommend that consumers add a \u201csecond factor\u201d of authentication to their online accounts. Typically this means receiving a short code via text message every time the user logs in from an unknown computer.

The Aug. 31 ruling, a first for Africa, followed a petition by Mr. Odinga and his NASA coalition. The court ordered a runoff between Messrs. Odinga and Kenyatta to be held on Oct. 26."]
["Africa News", "In the weeks since, Mr. Odinga has raised concerns that the new date didn\u2019t leave sufficient time to put in place safeguards preventing renewed irregularities in the vote\u2014a charge that he repeated on Tuesday. Most analysts say they believe that Mr. Odinga, a veteran politician who lost to Mr. Kenyatta in 2013, was unlikely to win the repeat vote. \u201cWe believe that all will be best served by NASA vacating its presidential candidature,\u201d Mr. Odinga said. The 72-year-old said that instead of holding the vote this month, parties should be able to make fresh nominations for candidates, a process that would likely take several weeks.

["Heard on the Street", "The popularity of conglomerates peaked in the 1970s, when management gurus pushed diversification. During the 1980s better data and spreadsheets helped analysts work out that specialist companies attracted higher valuations than peers within diversified groups. This \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d encouraged corporate raiders to buy companies with short-term \u201cjunk\u201d debt that they repaid at a profit by selling business units off individually. Thirty years later, activist investors are pursuing targets with different methods but similar aims. Some argue conglomerates trade at a discount because office politics get in the way of efficient capital allocation. \u201cJust as a parent loves all its children equally, a corporate parent treats all its divisions equally,\u201d as Henri Servaes,  professor of finance at the London Business School, caricatures the line of thought. Whatever the reason, history consistently shows that conglomerate spin offs make money. A 2015 paper by finance academics John McConnell, Steven Sibley and Wei Xu found that companies spun out of parents between 2001 and 2012 generated a return of 17.1% in excess of the benchmark over the 22 months following the split. The parents also outperformed, though only slightly. This confirmed the findings of an earlier paper that dealt with the even longer period from 1965 through 2000. Investors can buy into the phenomenon through exchange-traded funds that track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. This consists of companies with a market capitalization greater than $1 billion that were spun out of a corporate parent less than four years earlier. Over 10 years to end-October the index was up 14.5%, an index of all U.S. companies just 7.7%."]
["Heard on the Street", "There is a problem, though. The authors of the 2015 study found that spin offs fared worse than the benchmark in 2008, the year when stocks felt the full force of the financial crisis, and 2011, when the eurozone debt crisis erupted. Investing in spin offs is essentially a high-risk, high-return strategy. Diversification has systematically gone out of fashion when times are good and come in when capital markets hit a rough patch. Youngsters are more reluctant to quit the financial security of the parental home when the economy is misfiring, and corporate families are no different. The volume of spin offs rises and falls with the stock market, albeit with a lag, according to Dealogic data since 2007. This year has seen a spate of spin off announcements or rumors. Two automotive suppliers, Delphi and\n            Autoliv\n,\n      said they would split in two, in each case sparking a double-digit share-price jump. The combination of chemical giants Dow Chemical and\n            DuPont\n            \n      will lead to a huge three-way breakup over the coming 18 months. These and other deals have yet to make their way into the data, but, if there is indeed a surge, it could prove a sign that stock-market sentiment is toppy."]

["Politics and Policy", "For months, Mr. Trump has threatened to stop reimbursements to insurance companies\u2014a part of the ACA\u2014but his administration has always paid them in the end, including amid significant uncertainty in June and at a crucial moment in GOP negotiations just a week ago in July. The next set of payments, which total millions of dollars for insurers that have lowered deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for the poorest enrollees in coverage under the law also known as Obamacare, is due in three weeks.  Those payments have been challenged in court by House Republicans, who argue the funds were never authorized by Congress. A federal judge has sided with the House but allowed the payments to continue until the litigation concludes. Democrats have said that cutting off the payments would be tantamount to sabotaging the insurance markets, and that Republicans will bear the blame. \u201cIf the president refuses to make the cost-sharing reduction payments, every expert agrees that premiums will go up and health care will be more expensive for millions of Americans. The president ought to stop playing politics with people\u2019s lives and health care, start leading and finally begin acting presidential,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Saturday. Mr. Trump\u2019s Saturday tweet came on the heels of several others expressing his disappointment that GOP senators had so far failed to come together around a single piece of legislation that would fulfill a shared campaign pledge of repealing the ACA and enacting their own set of proposals in its place."]
["Politics and Policy", "It was also the first to mention that he was open to another idea proposed by conservative activists to pull lawmakers back to the task of a health-care bill: cutting off their existing health benefits. Activists including Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, have proposed that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration change a rule promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration that allows members of Congress and their staff to obtain subsidized insurance alongside other Washington, D.C., small businesses.   That rule has been the subject of significant contention for years, with some lawmakers contending that it is an end-run around a provision in the 2010 health law that requires members of Congress to get their health coverage like other Americans. Lawmakers and their aides get a hefty subsidy from their employer\u2014Congress\u2014when they buy coverage through the D.C. online insurance exchange, which critics contend is unique to them. Defenders of the rule argue that the provision was never intended to force members of Congress or their aides to lose the employer-sponsored health benefits that many people get on the job. Effectively cutting off members\u2019 existing health benefits would focus their attention, Heritage Action has argued.  \u201cWith the long-promised goal of repealing Obamacare and providing relief from the failing law slowly slipping away because of liberal intransigence, senators should finally subject themselves to the same burdens imposed upon their constituents. Maybe then they would come around to begin delivering on their longstanding promise,\u201d wrote Michael Needham, head of Heritage Action, in an opinion piece this week. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Republican lawmakers scattered after the early Friday morning defeat of fallback legislation to dismantle parts of the ACA. Some have said they want to turn quickly to bipartisan bills that shore up the individual markets with steps such as an appropriation for the contested payments. Others have said they are still pursuing GOP legislation and are refusing to give up the idea they can come back after recess with a proposal that secures the support of at least 50 Republicans in the Senate.

["Earnings", "The muted view also dragged down\n            Mattel\n Inc.,\n      whose shares fell 4.5% in Monday trading ahead of its third-quarter earnings report Thursday. Mattel shares have fallen about 44% on the year as a new CEO tries to turnaround the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels. Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner tried to reassure investors Monday that the impact from the bankruptcy could be softened by the fact that toys are available much more broadly and that the industry\u2019s fortunes aren\u2019t tied to one retailer. In addition to selling more toys at drugstores and dollar stores, Mr. Goldner said sales are growing much faster online than in stores. \u201cThe consumer continues to find our product,\u201d Mr. Goldner said. \u201cIt\u2019s really heartening to see online sell-through is even stronger than brick-and-mortar sell-through when there\u2019s no friction in the finding of our product.\u201d He said the broader distribution means that Hasbro expects it will find new outlets to sell inventory that may have been bound for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us if need be.  \u201cWe can find a home for all the inventory we have,\u201d Mr. Goldner said. Still, the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy filing, which occurred in September after some suppliers scaled back shipments, does inject a big question mark during a period when around 50% of toy sales are made. Mr. Goldner said the filing \u201cdoes introduce higher uncertainty\u201d about shipments to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in the fourth-quarter, which is the reason for the lowered sales view."]
["Earnings", "Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has secured $3.1 billion in bankruptcy financing and plans to continue operating most of its 1,600 stores through the holidays. Mattel and Hasbro were among Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us\u2019s biggest unsecured creditors, with Mattel owed more than $135 million and Hasbro $59 million when the retailer filed for protection, according to court papers.  Hasbro otherwise came through the third-quarter relatively unscathed. Earnings rose 3% to $265.6 million, or $2.09 a share. Total sales rose 7% to nearly $1.8 billion, on higher sales of Nerf blasters, Transformers robots and My Little Pony toys. Both were ahead of Wall Street expectations. A continued strength is Hasbro\u2019s gaming business, which posted a 22% sales increase, as the company continues to find new breakout hits like Speak Out. Meanwhile, old mainstays in that portfolio like Monopoly also are selling more items.

On the other hand, Qualcomm raised the price of its own pending bid to acquire NXP Semiconductors, making a deal much more likely. The 16% boost in deal value garnered the support of several key activist shareholders of NXP\u2014including Elliott Management Corp.\u2014who had been churning for a better price."]
["Heard on the Street", "Broadcom has long warned that raising the price for NXP could be fatal to its offer for Qualcomm. Deriding the move as a \u201ctransfer of value\u201d to NXP holders, Broadcom noted Tuesday morning that it is now \u201cevaluating its options.\u201d Broadcom\u2019s stock rose more than 2% Tuesday morning before slipping back by the close of trading. Broadcom\u2019s investors initially cheered the idea of buying Qualcomm, which would create the world\u2019s third-largest chip company based on annual revenue. But that enthusiasm seems to have dampened, as such a combination would face close scrutiny by regulators, especially with several Chinese smartphone manufacturers voicing opposition. Before Tuesday\u2019s open, Broadcom\u2019s share price was down 10% from the day it announced its first offer for Qualcomm; the PHLX Semiconductor Index is flat for that time. The truth is Broadcom doesn\u2019t need the deal. The company\u2019s record prior to Qualcomm has been impressive, with smart deal making giving it a strong position in several key chip markets while also boosting free cash flow. Wall Street, in turn, is in love. About 93% of analysts covering Broadcom rated the stock as a buy before the company\u2019s first Qualcomm bid. That is far more buy ratings than any other large-cap semiconductor company. As Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein notes, the \u201cold story on Broadcom was very clean.\u201d Buying Qualcomm risks tarnishing that image. The two chip makers have long operated in fundamentally different ways, raising the question of how well they could be integrated. And Broadcom to date has said little publicly about how it plans to restructure Qualcomm\u2019s licensing business, which generates most of its profits\u2014along with most of its problems."]
["Heard on the Street", "Broadcom may choose to leave its current \u201cbest and final\u201d offer of $82 intact and see how Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders vote on March 6. That could work, given that Qualcomm\u2019s share price is now about 25% below that number. But it is also worth noting that ISS stopped short of endorsing the company\u2019s full slate of alternative directors, and described Broadcom\u2019s offer as a \u201creasonable starting point.\u201d Broadcom\u2019s own investors, meanwhile, seem to now have a better end in mind.

["Technology", "The changes come in the wake of criticism that Facebook\u2019s news feed, by design, puts legitimate and fake news on equal footing, hurting public discourse during the U.S. presidential campaign. In December, Facebook said it would aim to curb fake news through partnerships with fact-checking organizations and tweaks to its algorithm.

One aspect of the program is helping users make what Facebook calls \u201csmart choices\u201d about the news they read both on and off the platform.

Media companies have a complicated relationship with Facebook. The social-media giant is home to the largest pool of readers in the world, giving publishers access to billions of potential new readers. But its dominance in digital ads is at odds with publishers, who are seeing their own revenues decline as advertisers flock to Facebook. On Wednesday, Facebook said it would allow publishers to exert influence on Facebook products when they are still being conceived by the development teams in hopes of building content that publishers and users will adopt."]
["Technology", "This month, for example, engineers for Facebook and the Germany\u2019s leading daily tabloid, Bild, will test a way to offer free trial subscriptions to readers from within Instant Articles, fast-loading articles on\u00a0Facebook\u2019s mobile app. Another area Facebook is studying is how to make local news easier to find on Facebook, and Ms. Simo said the company is looking for collaborators. Facebook has committed to better understanding \u201chow best to draw attention to journalism, instead of fake news,\u201d said Jennifer Preston,  vice president for journalism at the Knight Foundation, a journalism nonprofit that is working with Facebook to promote local news.  Still, Facebook allying itself with some established media companies and taking a stand for news literacy could stoke concerns, often voiced by conservatives, about liberal bias among Facebook employees and the news promoted by the site.

Among other things, Facebook is going to introduce ad breaks within regular videos and give publishers a cut of the proceeds, she added.

Rand Paul (R., Ky.) reintroduced late Wednesday a bill to repeal most of the 2010 health law without replacing it, a measure that cleared the last Congress when President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was in office.

It was unclear whether Mr. Trump would make headway with the conservatives, or whether it was they who would end up bringing Mr. Trump around to their position. Republican leaders who support the bill and conservatives who oppose it both see Mr. Trump as an ally, a situation that has left a confusing picture of the role the president would ultimately play. Conservatives agree with Mr. Trump on a key policy goal: lowering insurance premiums. At a Wednesday meeting with leaders of six conservative groups, Mr. Trump was \u201cclearly pushing and selling,\u201d said one person in the room.

But Republican unity on such issues is weakened by conservatives\u2019 distrust of GOP leaders\u2019 three-part strategy for repealing and replacing the law."]
["Health Policy", "The leaders plan to first pass the current bill repealing much of the law and offering some Republican-backed elements in their place. Since the bill generally focuses on budget-related matters, it would require only 51 votes to pass the Senate under congressional rules. The second phase would have Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price use his administrative power to undo other ACA provisions. The third step would be the hardest\u2014persuading enough Democrats to go along with a set of non-budget health-care bills that would take 60 votes to pass the Senate.  Mr. Trump has said letting insurers sell policies in every state would be part of the third phase. But conservatives insist that proposal should be included in the current legislation, since they doubt the likelihood of winning over enough Democrats to pass it. This debate could thrust the Senate\u2019s chief parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, into a crucial role, since she is the official who determines whether a measure is sufficiently budget-related to use the reconciliation process requiring just 51 votes. Some conservatives are now arguing that Ms. MacDonough merely advises on the rules, and that the ultimate decision is up to the Senate\u2019s presiding officer, who likely would be Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pence is expected to be on hand to break any ties in the narrowly divided Senate, where Republicans have 52 votes and the Democrats have 48. \u201cThe presiding officer makes the decision,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cThe parliamentarian advises on that question.\u201d"]
["Health Policy", "That fight was only one of several skirmishes Thursday, each drawing support and opposition from across the GOP spectrum. The Republican Study Committee, another group of conservative House members, formally endorsed a measure to block some low-income people who would currently qualify for Medicaid in states that expanded the program under the ACA from enrolling in 2018. The change would only affect new beneficiaries, while those already enrolled would be permitted to stay in the program. The Republican Study Committee proposal would essentially speed up the Medicaid freeze in the current bill by two years.  At Wednesday\u2019s White House meeting, conservatives proposed the idea to Mr. Trump of speeding up the date of the Medicaid freeze. \u201cI have heard they are leaning that way,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker (R., N.C.), referring to the White House. Republican leaders were also bracing for a potentially significant new problem\u2014the release early next week of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of the bill\u2019s cost and its impact on insurance coverage. The office is likely to estimate that at least 15 million fewer people would have coverage over a decade under the House GOP health-care plan, according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, in an analysis posted Thursday. That is largely because the plan ends the requirement that most Americans have health coverage or pay a penalty, as well as the proposal\u2019s gradual curtailing of federal Medicaid funding. "]

Both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill would adjust the income thresholds at which tax rates change using a \u201cchained\u201d measure of inflation rather than the better-known consumer-price index."]
["Capital Account", "This makes economic sense because economists consider the chained CPI a more accurate gauge of the cost of living. But because it also yields a lower measure of inflation, it pushes people more rapidly into higher tax brackets. For some income groups, this could eventually wipe out the entire initial tax cut, setting aside any boost to economic growth. This is almost certainly not the lawmakers\u2019 intent, but it illustrates the powerful and little-appreciated effect of seemingly technical provisions, and raises questions about whether the plan is as generous to the middle class as proponents claim. When your income rises, some of that merely protects your purchasing power against inflation. It\u2019s the part above inflation that represents your \u201creal\u201d raise. Indexing raises the income thresholds at which your tax rate rises. Without it, many taxpayers with no real gain in income would still be pushed into higher brackets merely because of inflation. Inflation indexing began in 1985, one of the most beneficial facets of Ronald Reagan\u2019s original tax cut. Tax brackets and key provisions such as the standard deduction and personal exemptions are indexed to the Labor Department\u2019s CPI. But economists have long known the CPI overstates the cost of living. When prices for a particular commodity rise faster, consumers shift to cheaper alternatives. The CPI adjusts for this by updating the weights of various items in the index every two years. The chained CPI captures these changes in behavior sooner, in effect updating the weight every month. Since 2001, inflation has averaged a quarter percentage point less under the chained CPI than the regular CPI. Real gross domestic product and the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target are both based on chained indexes."]
["Capital Account", "Taxpayers get a break from the current system because it shelters not just the raise that compensates for inflation, but some of their real raise, too. Both the House and Senate bills would in effect eliminate that second layer of protection by switching to the chained CPI. This raises about $130 billion more revenue over 10 years in the latest versions of both the House and Senate bills, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. But the impact is highly uneven. In last week\u2019s version of the Senate bill, households earning more than $1 million\u00a0a year are already in the highest bracket, so their after-tax income drops by just 0.1% by 2027 because of the new formula, according to Ernie Tedeschi, an analyst at Evercore ISI, who used a model developed by the American Enterprise Institute. He reckons the effect is similar in the House bill.  After-tax incomes drop by 0.2% to 0.3% for households earning between $40,000 and $1 million and 0.4% for those earning between $20,000 and $40,000. The impact is largest for the lowest-income taxpayers because they depend more on the standard deduction, child tax credit and a new family flexibility credit, all of which will be indexed to the chained CPI. The impact also compounds over time. In both bills the JCT estimates the revenue boost rises from $2 billion in 2019 to between $28 and $32 billion by 2027. It then keeps growing: the Tax Foundation, a think tank, estimates the change raises four times as much in the second decade as the first."]
["Capital Account", "This is also why some income groups start with a tax cut and end up with a tax increase. David Kamin, a law professor at New York University, calculates that a family of four earning $59,000 gets a tax cut of $1,000 in 2018 in the House plan but that disappears by 2024 assuming the family flexibility credit expires as scheduled, or by 2030 if it\u2019s extended. Once the new index becomes law, don\u2019t count on it being reversed, for two reasons: First, because the effect is so subtle in any single year, most taxpayers won\u2019t even notice so there is little political price to keeping it. Second, as deficits widen, the revenue the new index raises becomes ever more irreplaceable. Tuesday\u2019s amendments to the Senate bill illustrate this starkly. Lawmakers decided to let most of the personal tax cuts expire in 2025 to keep the total cost within Senate guidelines. But the chained CPI will stay. So if the old brackets return in 2026, they will be set at levels that raise more tax than under the regular CPI. Indeed, when lawmakers finally get around to tackling the deficit, they may apply the chained CPI to government benefits such as Social Security to save even more money. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, says because chained CPI is a superior inflation gauge, its adoption for both taxes and spending simply represents good governance. If Congress wants to grant more generous tax cuts or benefit increases, it should legislate them, he says. Meanwhile, tax reform\u2019s boost to wages via higher investment and economic growth is \u201cwhat matters to the middle class and that will dwarf any single provision\u201d in either bill."]
["Capital Account", "Mr. Kamin, who served in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, doesn\u2019t dispute that the chained CPI may be superior. But, he said, its effect should be offset somehow if the goal is to leave middle-class families ahead. Fairly or not, the use of the new inflation index makes it harder for the Trump administration to fight off criticism that this tax reform benefits the rich much more than the rest.

["Technology", "Problematic loading of supercooled fuels is believed to be the cause of a catastrophic explosion that destroyed an unmanned Falcon 9 during routine ground tests in September and, according to critics, also poses significant safety hazards for future crews destined for the international space station.  More than a year ago, a NASA advisory committee quietly raised concerns about possible dangers stemming from SpaceX\u2019s novel plans to fuel rockets while astronauts are strapped into capsules loaded on board.  Elon Musk, pictured here in 2014, listens to a question during a news conference in front of the SpaceX Dragon V2 spacecraft.Photo: Jae C.

But in his comments, the SpaceX spokesman also suggested some prospective fueling changes are likely in response to the panel\u2019s specific safety concerns. \u201cAs needed, additional controls will be put in place to ensure crew safety,\u201d he said. SpaceX previously talked about adjusting fueling rate and pressure during ground preparations."]
["Technology", "An update to NASA\u2019s website Monday afternoon said SpaceX\u2019s revised timetable targets May 2018 for the maiden manned mission. The delay puts SpaceX, as the closely held Southern California company is called, on roughly the same timeline for beginning manned missions as\n            Boeing\n Co.\n      , which announced a similar delay in October.  At the time, SpaceX maintained it was still confident its first manned flight would occur in 2017. The timing is significant because NASA is counting on the companies to replace Russian rockets and capsules, which currently are the only way for U.S. crews to reach the orbiting international space station. The agency hasn\u2019t committed to purchase Russian seats beyond 2018, but it may need to ensure such alternate transportation if U.S. manned efforts slip even further behind schedule. NASA didn\u2019t immediately respond. SpaceX, which suspended all Falcon 9 blastoffs in the wake of the September explosion, previously said it hopes to quickly resume unmanned launches, perhaps by early January. NASA initially envisioned the first manned launches of commercially developed crew capsules by 2015, but a series of technical hurdles and setbacks disrupted those plans for both companies. At SpaceX, over the years those challenges have ranged from problems with space suits to onboard life-support systems to leaks involving unmanned Dragon capsules that returned and splashed down, as planned, in water."]

["Earnings", "The average Ford pickup sold for $45,400 even with incentives factored in during the July through September period. That price firmly outpaces the $31,200 J.D. Power estimates is the average transaction price on vehicles sold in the U.S., and was also $2,800 higher than F-Series prices during the same period a year ago. \nGeneral Motors\n Co.\n      , which reported earnings Tuesday, also saw truck pricing increases, raking in $43,220 per Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra sold in the third quarter, or nearly $1,300 more than the same period a year ago. Ford\u2019s results highlight a persistent reality for car executives eager to showcase investments in future technology. The billions of dollars being spent on autonomous-vehicle research and making more affordable electric cars wouldn\u2019t be available if it weren\u2019t for brisk truck sales. The truck momentum has been sparked by the redesign of Ford\u2019s so-called Super Duty lineup, a series of bulky work trucks that can cost more than $100,000. The auto maker put new versions on sale last fall, including the F-250, as U.S. buyers soured on bread-and-butter sedans and compact cars. It marked the first major redesign of the Super Duty in several years. Ford also sells the F-150 truck for lighter-duty needs. The F-Series has been the best-selling vehicle in America since 1977. "]
["Earnings", " Competitors, convinced that low gasoline prices and favorable economic conditions will remain, are angling to cut in on Ford\u2019s truck dominance. GM and\n            Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\n            \n      NV are prepping redesigned models for introduction late next year, and those projects require billions of dollars and thousands of engineers.  Pickup trucks are a vital source of profit for the Detroit companies. While the Asian auto makers are formidable rivals in cars and crossover SUVs, none offer any serious challenge in the market for big pickups. Profit margins on those trucks\u2014used to haul recreational boats and on construction sites across America\u2014are typically far above 10% and can outpace luxury cars. Ford needs to protect its turf. North America continues to fuel Ford\u2019s bottom line, contributing nearly all of its automotive operating profit as other regions net out at about break-even. Ford\u2019s operating margin rose to 8.1% in the third quarter, short of the 10% margins that Detroit executives expect to squeeze from core operations but substantially better than the same period a year ago. The auto maker\u2019s redesigned Super Duty lineup of bulky work trucks has carried the bottom line.Photo: LM Otero/Associated Press Ford\u2019s overall profit increase during the quarter was also attributed to a lower tax rate and belt-tightening measures. The No. 2 U.S. auto maker by sales reported net income of $1.6 billion for the July through September period, and it raised its full-year earnings guidance."]
["Earnings", "The brighter outlook is a sign the company is optimistic about measures it is taking to improve its business, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said during a round table with reporters. Ford posted adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents, better than the average analysts\u2019 forecast of 33 cents. Revenue grew 1% to $36.5 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $32.8 billion. Ford cited early progress on new Chief Executive Jim Hackett\u2019s goal of slashing billions of dollars in engineering and manufacturing costs to improve Ford\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d as it pivots to longer-term bets on electric cars and autonomous vehicles. Costs improved by about $700 million in the quarter. \u201cI would look at this as a first down payment (on) good strong cost management,\u201d Mr. Shanks said.  The company, however, posted a surprise loss in Europe related to continued fallout from Brexit in the U.K. market, and slimmer margins in China due to pricing pressure. Pretax profit in the Asia-Pacific region more than doubled to $289 million, as cost-cutting lifted the company\u2019s profit margin there to 7.9%, from 4.3%. Ford also got a lift from its finance arm, where pretax profit edged up 6% to $600 million, despite analysts\u2019 forecast of a decline. Mr. Shanks said the resale values on a wave of vehicles being turned in after their leases expire are holding up better than expected.  Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com and John D.

["Markets Main", "The poor performance is a surprise as brokers from Goldman Sachs to HSBC had been rushing to get ready for the program and expecting an influx of cash into mainland China, which had been mostly off limits to international money managers. In addition, over the same period stocks in Shanghai have rocketed 21.9%, making it the world\u2019s top major climber this year as Beijing has eased monetary policy. Given the historic nature of the program, however, expectations had inevitably run too high, said Binay Chandgothia,  a portfolio manager at\n            Principal Global Investors\n,\n      which has $326 billion in assets under management. \u201cVolumes so far have been disappointing and lower at least than what the Street expected them to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut every time you have a new thing there\u2019s a big splash and expectations about it, the actual implementation takes time.\u201d Many large fund managers have found it difficult to tick off the necessary regulatory boxes to be able to invest in China via Stock Connect, he added.

Since the launch of the program, the Hang SengChina Enterprises Index, a gauge of mainland Chinese companies with Hong Kong listings, is up just 3.5%. The broader Hang Seng Index has fallen 5.9%."]
["Markets Main", "Analysts said another reason purchases of Hong Kong stocks have been slight is that Shanghai\u2019s stock exchange requires prospective investors to have a minimum 500,000 yuan on hand to invest. This stipulation \u201cis actually pretty onerous and it precludes a lot of people,\u201d said Francis Cheung,  head of China-Hong Kong strategy at brokerage CLSA. Those with the sufficient amount of capital have probably already found ways to take it out of China and have had the opportunity to invest in Hong Kong if they wanted, he said. \u201cThe reality is the government isn\u2019t trying very hard to keep money in China,\u201d Mr. Cheung said. In the run-up to the program\u2019s launch, CLSA conducted a poll of Chinese investors, 90% of whom said they would be happy to invest in Stock Connect in principle. However, that number dropped to 20% once respondents became aware of the minimum-investment limits. That said, with the benchmark Shanghai index in the midst of a bull market it is unclear how many Chinese investors would wish to buy lagging stocks in Hong Kong. On average, Chinese companies with stocks trading in Shanghai are 19.7% more expensive than corresponding shares traded in Hong Kong, according to the Hang Seng China AH Premium Index. The trading link was intended to help close the gap, but Shanghai\u2019s gains\u2014taken with a pinch of salt by many Hong Kong investors, who see a fragile rally driven more by momentum than fundamentals\u2014have meant the opposite has happened."]

Republican leaders believe they have the votes to keep the defunding measure in any final Senate bill, people familiar with the discussions said, though they still could remove it should that be the deciding factor in the bill\u2019s passage."]
["Politics and Policy", "Defunding Planned Parenthood has long been a priority for conservative lawmakers and anti-abortion groups, and they see the health bill as a rare opportunity to do so. Republicans plan to use a procedural maneuver to pass the bill with a simple Senate majority rather than the 60 votes usually required, giving the anti-abortion groups a potential opening. By law, Planned Parenthood can\u2019t use federal dollars to pay for abortions. But anti-abortion activists say any federal backing helps the nonprofit group stay in operation and continue performing the procedures, while abortion-rights groups say the money is used for unrelated exams and screening that are crucial to women\u2019s health. Anti-abortion groups such as the National Right to Life Committee, which maintains an influential scorecard for members of Congress based on their abortion and related votes, say inclusion of the defunding measure is a condition for their support of the broader health bill. \u201cWe have the votes in the Senate to pass this language now,\u201d said Carol Tobias,  president of the group.  These groups have also been pushing lawmakers to insert provisions in their bill that would bar people from using tax credits and money put into health-savings accounts to pay for abortions and some contraceptive coverage. The Senate parliamentarian has warned those lawmakers that attaching abortion restrictions to either measure could make them ineligible for inclusion in the bill, under Senate budget rules, forcing lawmakers to either excise the abortion language or remove the tax credits and health-savings accounts from their bill altogether."]
["Politics and Policy", "The push, coming from groups such as National Right to Life and the Susan B. Anthony List, has angered some centrist GOP senators, who are looking to broaden the tax credits and health-savings accounts to benefit low-income people. But the groups say that without the language included, they would be forced to oppose the entire bill.  Coupling the Planned Parenthood measure in particular with the GOP\u2019s Affordable Care Act repeal legislation threatens to drive away at least two centrist Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. \u201cI don\u2019t think that low-income women should be denied their choice of health care providers for family planning, cancer screenings, for well-women care,\u201d Ms. Collins said last month on ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only issue in this huge bill, but I certainly think it\u2019s not fair and it is a mistake to defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d If the provision is included, Ms. Collins plans to introduce an amendment excising it from the bill, a move that Ms. Murkowski is expected to support. Their votes to remove the funding cutoff would likely leave the Senate at a 50-50 stalemate, assuming no Democrats vote for the defunding measure, forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. A wild card could come in the form of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller,  Republican who is considered one of the chamber\u2019s most vulnerable lawmakers in the 2018 midterm elections. At an April town-hall meeting, Mr. Heller told constituents who asked about the network of women\u2019s health clinics, \u201cI have no problems with federal funding for Planned Parenthood\u201d\u2014a statement his office later walked back."]
["Politics and Policy", "People close to the senator say he feels squeezed on the issue and believes it could have political consequences for his campaign. Should Mr. Heller signal to GOP leaders that he is hesitant to vote against Planned Parenthood, that would likely kill the defunding provision. \u201cWhile he doesn\u2019t have a problem with many of the health care services Planned Parenthood offers to women, he is opposed to providing federal funding to any organization that performs abortions and is supported by taxpayers\u2019 dollars,\u201d said Megan Taylor,  a spokeswoman for Mr. Heller. \"He has a long record that reflects his position.\u201d Senate leaders for now are looking to use the House\u2019s defunding language, which would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding for one year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such a measure would cut off the organization from about $178 million in federal funds. About 60% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients receive services through Medicaid and other federal programs.  Congressional leaders can\u2019t include a permanent ban on Planned Parenthood under the Senate\u2019s special budgetary rules, because the CBO has estimated such a ban would cost the federal government extra money in increased births. Democrats attacked the GOP plans, as did Planned Parenthood\u2019s leaders. \u201cInstead of plotting the repeal of the Affordable Care Act in secret, Senate Republican leaders should listen to the 80% of voters who support Planned Parenthood and reject efforts to block people from getting care at our health centers,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund."]
["Politics and Policy", "Even as the Senate debate continues, several states have moved to cut off Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, which could have more lasting impact.  Earlier this month, Texas asked the federal government to restore Medicaid funding to family-planning programs the state had shunned for years\u2014with the proviso that the state be allowed to exclude Planned Parenthood as a provider. If the Trump administration grants that request, it would likely spur other Republican-dominated states to seek similar waivers. Several other states including Iowa are considering setting up state-funded family-planning programs that exclude abortion providers, forgoing federal funds in exchange for the ability to deny clinics like Planned Parenthood tax dollars. A recent move in this direction by Iowa\u2019s governor prompted Planned Parenthood to announce it would close four clinics in the state.

Even after harvesting one of their best wheat crops ever last year, thanks to plentiful rain and a mild winter, Mr. Scott isn\u2019t sure how long they can afford to keep farming that ground. Costs for seeds, fertilizer and equipment climbed so high and grain prices dropped so low that he still lost more than $120 an acre. Afraid to come up short again, Mr. Scott decided last fall not to plant 170 acres of winter wheat, close to a third of the usual amount. U.S. farmers sowed the fewest acres of winter wheat this season in more than a century."]

Spencer also works as a mechanic, and Mason is a substitute mailman. \u201cHaving a side job seems like the only way to make it work,\u201d she said. She and her husband have declared bankruptcy before. Farmers around Sterling lost $6,400 on average in 2015, the latest available data, after profits of $80,800 a year earlier, according to the Kansas Farm Management Association. Farming has always been a boom-and-bust enterprise. Today, the swings are sharper and less predictable now that the farm economy has become more international, with more countries growing food for export as well as for their own populations. American farmers\u2019 share of the global grain trade has fallen from 65% in the mid-1970s to 30% today, giving them less sway over prices. More producers and more buyers around the world also mean more potential disruptions from bad weather, famine or political crisis. Corn prices once varied year-to-year by less than $1 a bushel. Since 2006 they have shot up and dropped more than $4 a bushel.  Some farm towns have suffered as low crop prices pressure farmers. Above, Wilson, in Central Kansas. A decade ago, a U.S. biofuel boom and China\u2019s growing middle class lifted prices for crops like corn and soybeans. Many American growers spent the windfall buying land and half-million-dollar equipment."]
["Experiential", "The boom also encouraged farmers in other countries to ramp up production. Farmers world-wide put nearly 180 million new acres into cultivation over the past decade. Lower production costs, proximity to fast-growing markets and improving infrastructure gave some overseas farmers an edge. Corn and wheat output has never been higher, and never has so much grain been bunkered away.  From the early 1800s until the Great Depression, the number of U.S. farms grew steadily as pioneers spread west of the Mississippi River. Families typically raised a mix of crops and livestock on a few hundred acres of land at most. After World War II, high-horsepower tractors and combines enabled farmers to cover more ground. Two decades ago, genetically engineered seeds helped farmers grow more. Farms grew bigger and more specialized. Large-scale operations now account for half of U.S. agricultural production. Most farms, even some of the biggest, are still run by families. As farm sizes jumped, their numbers fell, from six million in 1945 to just over two million in 2015, nearing a threshold last seen in the mid-1800s. Total acres farmed in the U.S. have dropped 24% to 912 million acres. Russia, meanwhile, has swung over the past quarter-century from the world\u2019s largest wheat importer to the biggest exporter, said Dan Basse,  president of Chicago-based research firm AgResource Co. Farmers there planted even more wheat last year to take advantage of the U.S. dollar\u2019s recent climb against many currencies. That encourages Russian farmers to export as much wheat as possible for dollars, which convert to about twice the number of rubles they did three years ago."]
["Experiential", "The strong dollar also allows farmers in some countries to undercut U.S. prices. \u201cAs the dollar stays strong, U.S. farmers don\u2019t have a lever to pull,\u201d Mr. Basse said. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow bleed, not a cut to the jugular all at once.\u201d The Obama administration last year accused China of unfairly subsidizing wheat production and improperly limiting grain imports to the detriment of U.S. farmers. The USDA in October said it would pay more than $7 billion in financial assistance under existing programs to help farmers survive the current downturn.  U.S. wheat exports last season were the lowest in almost a half-century, though government forecasters expect them to improve this year. Mr. Basse said he believes it won\u2019t be economically viable for the U.S. to export wheat within five years. Economists don\u2019t expect the current slump to be as severe as the crisis that hit the Farm Belt in the 1980s. In those days, grain prices plunged following a rally in the previous decade that spurred farmers to expand production, amassing debt as a surplus grew. Farmland values plummeted and interest rates soared, sparking a bust that forced many farmers and lenders out of business.  Farmland values are expected to hold up better this time. Farm incomes hit record highs as recently as 2013, leaving many growers with significant cash reserves. Interest rates, while expected to rise, are still near record lows. Although debt-to-asset ratios among U.S. farmers are projected to increase in 2017 for the fifth straight year, they also remain historically low. "]
["Experiential", "Grain sorghum grows in Central Kansas. Costs for farm supplies like fertilizer have fallen, and economists foresee increasing pressure on seed prices and land rental rates. The crunch could ease if bad weather curbs harvests, lifting demand for America\u2019s excess grain. Fewer rural communities rely economically on agriculture today, which could help insulate them from the downturn. For some, the slump is an opportunity. Farmers with low debts and enough scale to profit from last year\u2019s record harvests could be in a position to rent or buy up land from struggling neighbors.  Lee Scheufler,  65, has expanded his farm in Sterling nearly 10-fold over the years, starting with 600 acres four decades ago. Having squirreled away money during profitable years, he recently bought and rented higher-quality land to replace some of his weaker holdings. \u201cWe tried to position ourselves for when the other shoe drops,\u201d said Mr. Scheufler, adding that someday he would like to pass on his land to a younger grower just beginning to farm, like a neighbor did for him. One chilly afternoon in October, Mr. Scheufler steered his combine across the first field he bought. The machine\u2019s giant claw spun through rows of golden soybeans. A hawk circled the combine\u2019s wake, hunting for exposed field mice. He recalled farmers whose land he has taken over: Ted Hartwick\u2019s, the Matthews\u2019, the Profits\u2019, his father\u2019s. \u201cEach property has its own history,\u201d he said. Kansas towns have also been hit by the drop in oil prices since 2014. Above, unused pump jacks and other debris from the oil industry."]
["Experiential", "In the late 1970s, he joined thousands of farmers in Washington for a demonstration urging the government to address low grain prices and farm foreclosures. As some drove their tractors onto the National Mall, his group rang a bell every five minutes to symbolize the rate at which farms were closing. He has been reminded of those days often this year.  \u201cThe potential for a big crisis is real,\u201d he said. \u201cIf things stay similar to how they are now, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d In Ransom, Mr. Scott has resorted to government assistance to guarantee himself some income. He placed 170 acres in a government conservation program that pays farmers to plant fields with grass rather than crops. That seemed like his only choice after spending about $6.50 a bushel on seed, fertilizer, fuel and pesticides to grow wheat last year only to earn $2.90 a bushel. During planting season last fall, he and his 82-year-old father cut back on fertilizer and coaxed one more crop out of a 20-year-old chemical sprayer with a worn-out engine. Many of his peers have given up. There were 28 students in Mr. Scott\u2019s graduating class at Ransom\u2019s high school nearly four decades ago. Most were farmers\u2019 children. This year there are nine students in the school\u2019s senior class. \u201cFarms got bigger to be more efficient, but it\u2019s caused these towns to die a slow death,\u201d Mr. Scott said."]
["Experiential", " Monty Roth\u2019s Loaves n\u2019 Fishes cafe was barely profitable last year. He said he might close it this month if sales don\u2019t improve. Oil, the other big business in Ransom, has been battered by the drop in crude prices since late 2014. Most oil workers have left town. David Radenberg, who has farmed for 30 years in Claflin, Kan., said this crop could be his last if prices remain low.  In Great Bend, 80 miles east of Ransom, Les Hopkins recently sold his John Deere dealership after sales all but stopped. He is owed about $100,000 by farmers who financed machinery purchases they haven\u2019t paid off. He has tried tracking them down by calling from cellphone numbers they won\u2019t recognize. \u201cThat money is gone,\u201d he said. Bankers say many farmers are burning through savings to stay in business. They expect some to retire rather than lose more money. Young farmers without much savings are vulnerable, as are large growers who racked up debt to expand operations. Some locked into multiyear land leases at high rents. The motor on David Radenberg\u2019s tractor gave out last fall as he sowed wheat on his family\u2019s 2,400 acre farm in Claflin, 90 miles east of Ransom. He didn\u2019t have the money to fix it. \u201cYou want to cry when you find out how much it costs,\u201d he said. He decided to sell the tractor for $10,500 and rely on an older model. If grain prices remain weak, the farm could be next. After 30 years farming, this crop could be his last: \u201cDo I go work at Wal-Mart as a greeter or as a parts man at the mechanics shop?\u201d"]

["Economic Data", "That figure, a record for the nearly five decades for which such data exist, marks the U.S.\u2019s largest trade deficit with any trading partner. By comparison, China\u2019s overall foreign trade surplus contracted 17% as higher prices of oil, iron ore and other commodities raised the value of inbound shipments from countries like Russia, Australia and Saudi Arabia. The widening of the China-U.S. trade imbalance comes as U.S. and Chinese officials and business groups warn of sharper clashes over trade between the world\u2019s largest economies. \u201cThe risks of growing U.S.-China trade conflicts are high,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a senior economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank in Beijing. President Donald Trump has promised sterner measures to curb the U.S.\u2019s chronic trade imbalance with China. In a turnabout in tactics, Trump administration officials have set aside the longstanding practice of eking out piecemeal concessions from Beijing on trade and market access. Instead, U.S. officials are preparing sanctions or other enforcement actions against China to try to challenge practices that the administration says favor Chinese companies and restrict U.S. ones. The Trump administration faces a series of decisions in the coming weeks and months on whether to enact penalties on imports of Chinese products such as steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar equipment. An investigation is proceeding on whether China is forcing American companies to turn over proprietary technologies and information in exchange for access to the Chinese market."]
["Economic Data", "Mr. Trump savaged China as a predatory trader during his campaign for the presidency, though he has toned down his rhetoric since. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, before the latest trade figures were published, Mr. Trump suggested he would have resorted to stricter measures to correct the trade imbalance with China if it weren\u2019t for Beijing\u2019s help in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear weapons development. \u201cWe\u2019ve been much tougher on China, but not nearly as tough as I would be, but they are helping us a lot with North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said.  Friday\u2019s trade data showed that China\u2019s imports from North Korea fell 33% in 2017, a possible indication of Beijing\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. and compliance with U.N. sanctions, though China\u2019s exports to North Korea increased 8.3%. Chinese officials have played down any friction in public remarks, including in Friday\u2019s announcement of trade figures.  In closed-door meetings with American officials and business executives, Chinese officials have threatened tit-for-tat for any U.S. penalties and urged American companies with large operations in China to warn Washington against taking such actions. \u201cWe have contingency plans in place,\u201d a Chinese official involved in policy-making said, without giving details. One likely target is imports of U.S. soybeans. China\u2019s hefty demand for soybeans, used to feed hogs in large-scale farms, has benefited U.S. farmers and companies including Cargill Inc. and\n            Archer Daniels Midland\n Co.\n      , and executives with American soybean exporters have said they\u2019ve been warned that shipments could suffer in a trade spat with the U.S."]
["Economic Data", "Reducing the U.S. exports carries some risks by possibly leading to a rise in pork prices in China and potentially driving up inflation, economists said. While most trade experts don\u2019t expect a full-fledged trade war this year, many foresee a proliferation of disputes and more U.S. penalties on some Chinese goods. And Chinese trade experts and analysts said that in the near-term little can be done to reduce the trade imbalance, given that the strong U.S. economy is likely to translate into heftier demand for Chinese goods.  \u201cThe U.S. economy will probably keep recovering this year, so it won\u2019t be easy for the Sino-U.S. trade surplus to narrow too much in 2018,\u201d said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think tank under China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is much Trump can do to reverse the situation.\u201d  China\u2019s $275.8 billion surplus with the U.S. last year surpassed the previous record of $261 billion in 2015, according to Chinese data. U.S. figures put the 2015 deficit with China at $367 billion. China\u2019s trade figures don\u2019t match U.S. figures due to different calculation methods. Indirect shipments via Hong Kong and other intermediaries is another factor that has been cited for the discrepancy in the sets of figures.

["Technology", "The Milpitas, Calif., company is the most prominent among a new wave of cybersecurity firms making a name for themselves in the wake of data breaches. One thing FireEye doesn\u2019t have, and isn\u2019t expected to deliver before 2018, is an annual profit. FireEye\u2019s red ink is common in Silicon Valley, where young tech companies often bear the cost burden of developing unique offerings and recruiting customers. But Chief Executive Dave DeWalt\u2019s strategy for reversing the losses is more reminiscent of an east coast defense contractor: keep spending on technology while embracing the government as a key customer.  FireEye is a prime example of how security companies increasingly stake their reputations on ties to Washington. CrowdStrike Inc., which just received investment from Google Capital to further develop its security software, counts the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s former lead cybercop as a top executive. Tanium Inc., privately valued at $3.5 billion, recently opened a federal office and hired a pair of FBI agents to help it win government contracts. FireEye\u2019s main business is selling hardware to large organizations to detect malicious computer code, or malware. Mr. DeWalt, a 51-year-old former college wrestler, likes to regale investors with details of its subscription renewal rates and the potential of a new partnership with credit-card issuer\n            Visa\n Inc.\n In the next breath, he\u2019ll boast his employees collectively hold security clearances in 18 countries, refer to FireEye as \u201ca defense-industrial-base vendor\u201d or explain how he seeks to \u201cwin the government.\u201d "]
["Technology", "Relationships with three-letter agencies, Mr. DeWalt says, are a big part of the company\u2019s financial future. He told an investor conference in June that government officials are \u201cbringing us in as a trusted adviser\u201d on high-profile breaches. \u201cA large portion of our business comes from that relationship with government,\u201d he added that same day at a company event. \n\u2018I see the opportunity of a lifetime. \u2019\n FireEye posted a $444 million loss last year on $426 million in revenue, which was up 163% from the prior year\u2019s sales. For every $1 in revenue, the company spent 94 cents on sales and marketing. Mr. DeWalt believes he has to spend big now to win customers. \u201cWhy should I be conservative in my spending?\u201d he asked in an interview. \u201cI see an opportunity of a lifetime.\u201d  Key to his strategy is the company\u2019s Mandiant unit, acquired for roughly $1 billion in late 2013. Founded by former Air Force investigator Kevin Mandia,  44 years old, Mandiant was an early leader in investigating corporate breaches. The FBI paid Mandiant more than $17 million during the past decade, mostly to teach its agents about hacking cases, according to federal contracts.  Mandiant is best known for accusing two Chinese nationals by name in 2013 of hacking into U.S. companies and stealing corporate secrets for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. A year later, the Justice Department indicted one of the men."]
["Technology", "FireEye executives and former U.S. officials say federal agents have recommended Mandiant response teams to hacking victims. The probes became sales opportunities for FireEye, Mr. DeWalt told the analysts in June. A data breach at\n            Michaels Stores\n Inc.\n      illustrates how the businesses intersect. Michaels summoned Mandiant following its late 2013 breach, which also was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service.  In a presentation to investors earlier this year, FireEye said it had recorded more than $18 million in billings from a \u201clarge retailer\u201d for helping to clean up a breach and subsequent purchases of equipment and services. Two people familiar with the matter said the retailer referred to in the slide is Michaels. Prior to publication of this article, Michaels didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment. After publication, a spokesman for Michaels said $18 million isn\u2019t accurate and the amount the company has agreed to spend with FireEye is \u201csubstantially smaller.\u201d  It is unclear how much of FireEye\u2019s revenue stems from such cases. FireEye tells analysts that about 90% of its hacking responses and security assessments lead to the sale of another product or service.  Mr. DeWalt said Mandiant\u2019s consultations and investigations account for between 15% and 20% of revenue. Current and former FireEye employees say Mr. DeWalt sometimes overstates his ties to Washington to help its corporate business. In June, he told CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer that a new certification from the Department of Homeland Security only given to FireEye \u201callows companies who use our product to basically be indemnified against legal costs relative to being breached.\u201d"]

China is an economic superpower with a strong sense of historical grievance and a leader who, like Mr. Trump, has based his legitimacy on making his nation great again. Prospects for accommodation might seem bleak. But there is one reason for optimism: Despite all the bluster, both sides have far more to lose than they are letting on.  Whatever the outcome, important industries in both countries could be pawns in negotiations. Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s speech at Davos made clear that China needs trade, and vague pronouncements about further opening the financial sector released immediately beforehand only bolstered that argument.

["Heard on the Street", "That is true even though net merchandise exports to the U.S. were just 2.6% of GDP in third quarter of 2016, half the level 10 years ago. That comfortable figure obscures significant weakness. In 2006 China was reaping reform dividends and riding an investment boom triggered by real estate privatization. The picture now is quite different. Housing demand is peaking, exports are declining, and inefficient state-owned companies continue to add to big debt piles.  Large portions of China\u2019s state sector already strongly resemble the locked, \u201cdark room\u201d which Mr. Xi used as a metaphor for protectionism at Davos. China needs more, not less, foreign involvement to give ammunition to reformers\u2014as its World Trade Organization accession once did. Rising tensions also come at a particularly bad time for Mr. Xi, who hopes to orchestrate the selection of the next generation of Party leadership this fall.  Economists estimate Mr. Trump\u2019s 45% tariff would cut Chinese growth by around 1 to 3 percentage points. The latter case would mean spiking unemployment at the worst possible time politically, forcing another round of inefficient stimulus the nation can ill afford. On the U.S. side, the low percentage of total U.S. exports sent to China\u2014around 8%, compared with 20% each to Canada and the European Union\u2014obscures very real pain points.\n            Boeing\n            \n      gets 13% of its revenue from China, and Apple makes one-fifth of its sales there. "]
["Heard on the Street", "Another likely pressure point is soybeans, a big earner for Mr. Trump\u2019s rural constituency. The U.S. also runs a large services surplus with China, equal to nearly 13% of its global services balance. And state-owned firms account for around 40% of Chinese demand for U.S. business services, according to the Peterson Institute. Financial data and electronic payments firms could struggle. Finally, rising tariff-driven inflation could goad the Federal Reserve into quicker action, choking off a Trump recovery and the equity market rally. Mr. Trump has long advocated stronger U.S. negotiating tactics, but his goal is more growth and jobs, not a damaging trade war. China, meanwhile, has a history of tough rhetoric matched with pragmatism. A meaningful opening up of protected Chinese sectors\u2014which China\u2019s cabinet gestured at Tuesday\u2014could help clear the way for a more comprehensive deal. Investors must hope the public war of words will be matched by skilled private deal-making. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The U.S. military maintains strict discipline when it comes to discussing such operations in advance, taking the position that removing the element of surprise can render operations less effective and put troops in danger."]
["World News", "\u201cThe department does not comment on potential future military actions,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said Wednesday when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cI refer you to the White House to characterize the president\u2019s tweet.\u201d But the commander-in-chief\u2019s statements have telegraphed U.S. military intentions, appearing at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s own criticisms of former President Barack Obama and catching the Pentagon off guard.  \u201cThe last thing in the world any military organization should be doing is telegraphing what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d said retired Army Gen. Ben Hodges. If the U.S. now opts not to conduct strikes in Syria, it would weaken Mr. Trump\u2019s word the next time, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d Gen. Hodges, now a \u00a0a senior consultant at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for European Policy Analysis, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet early Wednesday, not only because it signaled a potential future military move, but because it could box the U.S. into a course of action. Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements may already have triggered moves by adversaries, military officials said. Syria has moved its fighter jets, sending some to a Russia-operated airbase near the Syrian city of Latakia, according to Syrian experts, in the belief that the U.S. won\u2019t strike Russian-protected targets. Iranian troops and allied militias, meanwhile, were redeploying around the country, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later Wednesday that Mr. Trump hadn\u2019t made a final decision on how the U.S. will respond to chemical-weapons attacks in Syria and that all options remain on the table."]
["World News", "Ms. Sanders argued that the key difference between Mr. Trump\u2019s comments and Mr. Obama\u2019s actions was that Mr. Trump \u201chas not laid out a timetable.\u201d Mr. Obama, in planning troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, issued a detailed timeline. Mr. Trump in recent days has given estimates of timetables for administration decision making. At the Pentagon, some feared the president\u2019s comments could affect the U.S. military plans leading up to a potential strike, two defense officials said. By telegraphing American intentions in Syria before war planning is even complete, Mr. Trump runs the risk that international coalition support for strikes may flag, or that the operation doesn\u2019t take place at all. Footage released by Douma Revolution show patients being treated at a hospital in Syria after an alleged chemical weapons attack. Viewer discretion is advised. PHOTO: SYRIA CIVIL DEFENCE/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES Some were concerned the tweet could be interpreted as an unofficial declaration of military action, making it difficult for the U.S. to step back later. Normally, presidential orders to conduct strikes go through the military chain of command, with specifics about what is expected and what the military hopes to achieve with the use of weapons and personnel. By telling the world that the strike was imminent, the president could have put the USS Donald Cook, which is in the region\u2019s waters and expected to be a part of any operation, in danger of harassment flights and maneuvers by Russian forces, one defense official said. \u201cIt\u2019s a consideration,\u201d he said."]
["World News", "Despite the frustration, military officers refrained from direct criticism of the tweets. Mr. Trump \u201cis still the commander in chief,\u201d one defense official said, declining to express his views. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that the U.S. is still assessing the intelligence to confirm if the Syrian regime is behind the attack, and coordinating with allies. Before he assumed office and in the past year, Mr. Trump repeatedly pledged not to announce military moves in advance and had criticized the Obama administration for doing the same. In 2013, while Mr. Obama was president, Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201c\u2026I would not go into Syria, but if I did, it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.\u201d Mr. Mattis on Wednesday declined to respond to a shouted question about any concerns he had about the commander-in-chief\u2019s tweets about future military operations. The Pentagon chief himself has been adamant about containing leaks at the Pentagon in part, he has said, because he wants adversaries to be surprised by the U.S. military. Mr. Mattis on March 27 told reporters: \u201cI never talk about future operations.\u201d Mr. Trump on Thursday tweeted that he had \u201cNever said when an attack on Syria would take place.

OPEC\u2019s members have agreed with 10 nations outside the cartel to cap their production at roughly 1.8 million barrels a day lower than levels in October 2016. Their goal is to draw down historically high amounts of oil in storage, which represent a global oil supply that has kept prices between $45 and $55 a barrel for much of the year."]
["Oil Markets", "Crude prices fell after report and were trading roughly flat for the day on Tuesday afternoon in London trading. Brent crude was up 0.04% at $48.31 and WTI was down 0.17% at $46. On Tuesday, OPEC said its efforts to \u201crebalance\u201d the market were having success but at a slower pace than expected back in December when it clinched its deal to cut output. The group blamed U.S. producers, whose output rose on the back of a price increase caused by OPEC\u2019s production deal.  OPEC said Tuesday that oil inventories in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a group of industrialized, oil-consuming nations\u2014remained higher than the cartel wants. OECD stocks were still over 3 billion barrels, 251 million barrels above OPEC\u2019s target. OPEC said it was producing about 100,000 barrels of oil more than there was demand for every day, another factor weighing on oil prices.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Sunday that the drawdown in crude oil inventories will accelerate in the next three to four months, and OPEC doesn\u2019t need to adjust its production-cut deal. The increased output from Libya and Nigeria wasn\u2019t a surprise because those countries were exempted from any obligation to cut as they try to come back from sabotage and violent disruptions to their supplies. But Iraq agreed last December, and again in May, to some of the largest production cuts undertaken by the cartel. Instead its output increased over 44,000 barrels a day to over 4.4 million barrels a day. Iraq didn\u2019t supply its own production figures to OPEC, and the country\u2019s oil officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment."]
["Oil Markets", "Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s biggest producer and the world\u2019s biggest exporter, raised its production slightly to 9.94 million barrels a day in May from 9.938 million barrels a day a month earlier, according to OPEC, citing sources such as shippers, analysts and industry executives. The Saudi kingdom itself told OPEC its production fell by 66,200 barrels a day last month to 9.880 million barrels a day. As for non-OPEC producers, OPEC said their output is expected to grow by 840,000 barrels a day this year, a downward revision of 110,000 barrels a day. Lower output from Russia, as well as Brunei, the Sudans and Kazakhstan following the global supply-cut deal is expected to offset higher growth in Canada and the U.K. U.S. oil supply growth for 2017 was also cut by 30,000 barrels a day because of lower output than expected in the first quarter of this year.

The disclosure, made Wednesday afternoon, marks another escalation of the sexual-assault scandal that has already resulted in the dismissal of the Baptist university\u2019s football coach and president. The investigation also marks a shift for the Education Department, which previously indicated it was comfortable with Baylor\u2019s internal attempts to handle the scandal. The investigation was prompted by a Sept. 26 complaint from Patty Crawford, Baylor\u2019s former Title IX coordinator. She said in her complaint with the Education Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights that she was retaliated against by the school\u2019s leadership for trying to do her job, said her lawyer, Rogge Dunn of Dallas. She resigned earlier this month."]
["U.S. News", "The Education Department said it doesn\u2019t typically identify complainants but that in this case Ms. Crawford has given her permission. Mr. Dunn said Ms. Crawford was recently interviewed by an Education Department investigator and was \u201cpleased\u201d that the department had opened a formal investigation into her complaint. Baylor is among a number of schools to face legal scrutiny and public outrage over the handling of sexual-assault cases, particularly those involving athletes. Two former Baylor football players have been convicted of rape in recent years, and a third is under indictment. The third player, Shawn Oakman,  pleaded not guilty in August. A Philadelphia law firm commissioned by Baylor in May issued scathing but unspecific findings saying that the school had turned a blind eye to sexual assault, and described what it called institutional failures to deal with such allegations. Baylor has pledged to implement the recommendations from the law firm\u2019s report, with the chairman of the school\u2019s board of regents saying its leadership was \u201chorrified by the extent of these acts of sexual violence on our campus.\u201d Following the school\u2019s announcement, the Education Department issued a statement saying it understood \u201cthat Baylor leaders have taken steps to satisfy Title IX\u201d but would investigate if alerted to further problems. A Baylor representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Baylor is also fighting a number of Title IX lawsuits by victims alleging that the school failed to adequately investigate alleged sexual assaults against them.

Whole Foods\u2019 stock has lost nearly half of its value since peaking in 2013, and as of Friday\u2019s close had risen just 1.5% in the past 12 months, compared with a 15% gain in the S&P 500.

Jana has lined up possible board nominees, according to the filing, four months before the deadline to launch a board fight.

That can be a rough transition.\u201d The broader grocery industry is struggling with increased competition and a slump in food prices that has eaten into profits. But Whole Foods has struggled in particular as it has lost ground in the natural and organic market that it once dominated. As pressure has mounted, Whole Foods has cut costs and abandoned an ambitious plan to nearly triple its number of stores. It has tried various marketing gambits to retain customers. The company, which is based in Austin, Texas, began testing a loyalty program in 2014, and intends to expand it nationally from a pilot in the Dallas area. Chief Executive John Mackey has said he expects these efforts to reverse the company\u2019s fortunes. But Whole Foods lowered its sales and profit forecasts for the year in February.

Fueled by the holiday deep freeze, futures prices continued their late December rally into the new year, rising 17% over just seven trading sessions. There are good arguments for why prices may sputter in the next several weeks, but the prospect of a nail-biting end to \u201cwithdrawal season\u201d can\u2019t be ruled out. The U.S. is now less than halfway through the five-month stretch when heating demand puts the market into deficit, forcing utilities to withdraw gas from underground storage. Although there always has been enough gas put away during the April through October \u201cinjection season\u201d to keep Americans warm, ferocious late-winter market rallies have erupted when projections have shown inventories dipping below one trillion cubic feet."]
["Heard on the Street", "Until just before Christmas, the amount of gas in storage was 3.332 trillion cubic feet, slightly below the five-year average. The nasty cold snap of the last two weeks will change that. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Thursday should show the biggest withdrawal of the season by far. That will likely be topped next week. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects heating-degree days, a measure of heating demand, to be more than 60% above normal in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states this week on a gas-heating weighted basis. By contrast, heating-degree days in the second half of 2017 were about 10% below normal for the U.S. as a whole. A cold snap is only a concern if it lasts a long time. If the Northeast returns to a weather pattern identical to the last three months of 2016-2017\u2019s mild heating season, storage would be above 1.84 trillion cubic feet in early April. But a repeat of 2013-2014\u2019s weather pattern could put gas in underground storage well into the danger zone with 850 billion cubic feet in sight by late March. Back in 2014, storage plunged to 824 billion cubic feet.  Traders didn\u2019t wait for inventories to fall that low, though. In the six weeks leading up to Feb. 21, the coldest part of that frigid winter, futures prices rallied by 54% as storage fell by nearly 1.4 trillion cubic feet. While \u201csix more weeks of winter\u201d is a folk tale, the gas market\u2019s margin for error is getting narrower and traders aren\u2019t taking any chances."]

Currency strategists expect a new bout of volatility in sterling as London and Brussels negotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, and many investors fret about the potential effects of this on the U.K. economy. "]
["Foreign Exchange", "Sterling\u2019s fall shows that currency traders are mainly ignoring a raft of better-than-expected British economic data to focus on political developments. Strength in the dollar is adding to the downward pressure.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May was interviewed by Sky News on Sunday. She said she would announce details of the country's European Union exit plans in the next few weeks. Photo: Associated Press \u201cUncertainty is extremely high when it comes to the Brexit process,\u201d said Thu Lan Nguyen,  foreign-exchange analyst at\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nCommerzbank\n.\n      \u201cThe risk of a sharp downward move in the pound is always high in this environment.\u201d The heightened uncertainty is unlikely to end in March, when the government says it will trigger Article 50, the formal start of two years of Brexit negotiations. \u201cJudging from crises that we\u2019ve seen in Europe in the past couple of years, when a deal is reached, it\u2019s reached at the last minute,\u201d added Ms. Nguyen. \u201cThe big risk for the pound is that it will depreciate sharply before then.\u201d Sterling\u2019s latest decline was triggered Sunday, when Mrs. May said in an interview with\u00a0Sky News that\u00a0the U.K. would aim for a clean break from the EU. That reiterated her intention to prioritize control of immigration over access to the bloc\u2019s single market in coming Brexit negotiations. \u201cOften, people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU, but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU,\u201d Mrs. May said in the interview. \u201cWe are leaving. We are coming out.\u201d "]
["Foreign Exchange", "On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the line taken by EU leaders since the Brexit vote. Ms. Merkel stressed that full access to the single market would require the U.K. to adhere to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.  The pound plunged in October following similar comments from Mrs. May at the\u00a0Conservative Party conference. In late September, the pound had traded as high as $1.30. \u201cThere is no clarity on what Brexit means; the political statements seem to change every day,\u201d said Lefteris Farmakis,  macro strategist at UBS. \u201cThis uncertainty means more volatility in the next few months.\u201d On Monday, Mrs. May said that her comments on Sunday were nothing new and that the U.K. wants the best deal, trading with and operating within the single market.  Sterling\u2019s continued weakness comes despite U.K. economic data continuing to defy widespread predictions that growth would deteriorate after Britain voted for Brexit in June. Retail sales grew by 5.9% in the 12 months to November 2016, and a purchasing managers\u2019 survey showed manufacturing in December growing at its fastest pace in 2\u00bd years.  But most analysts believe the pound will continue to head lower partly because of worries about the longer-term direction of the U.K. economy.  Pro-Brexit demonstrators held a protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Nov. 23 last year.Photo: Jack Taylor/Getty Images \u201cThe U.K. hasn\u2019t left Europe yet,\u201d said Phyllis Papadavid,  an economist at the Overseas Development Institute, a think tank. \u201cSterling\u2019s weakness reflects worries about economic consequences when we have left.\u201d"]
["Foreign Exchange", "Sterling is also being hit by the strong dollar, which has gained in recent months on a belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster rate in 2017. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was down slightly on Monday. Since the U.S. presidential election in November, the dollar has gained 1.8% against the pound, 4.3% against the euro and 10% against the yen.  \nMorgan Stanley\n            \n      expects sterling to fall to $1.17 this quarter, because it thinks that political uncertainty will affect investment in 2017. UBS\u2019s Mr. Farmakis expects the pound to drop to $1.13 by the end of this year.  However, some forecasters disagree. \u201cWe think further signs that the government is being forced toward a soft Brexit will emerge, enabling sterling to climb back to about $1.30 and \u20ac1.24 by the end of this year,\u201d Samuel Tombs,  chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note. Meanwhile, investors and analysts are scouring the media for hints on how Britain will negotiate its exit and how Brussels will respond.  Mrs. May has revealed few details about her plans and has faced growing pressure from critics who question whether her government has clear goals. She has promised that she would lay out more details about her Brexit plan early this year, but her office hasn\u2019t confirmed a specific date. "]

The blastoff from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center was closely followed by the global aerospace industry, and it capped multiple design changes, years of delays and a roughly $1 billion investment by SpaceX, as the company is commonly called. With throngs of spectators on hand, the closely held Southern California company defied industry critics by flying the world\u2019s most powerful rocket since U.S. astronauts landed on the moon almost five decades ago.  The 230-foot rocket, which featured 27 engines with the combined thrust of some 18\n            Boeing\n Co.\n      747 jumbo jets, climbed into clear skies at 3:45 p.m. local time. It carried a Tesla roadster as a dummy payload and publicity stunt."]
["Technology", "The launch countdown had been delayed for about two hours because of winds.   The rocket\u2019s two side boosters shut down, then separated as expected less than three minutes into the flight. All other systems worked as designed during the ascent, apparently without any significant problems, and the cover protecting the payload separated precisely on cue. A Tesla Roadster being prepped for its trip aboard the Falcon Heavy rocket. The car went up with the rocket on Tuesday. Photo: Elon Musk/Associated Press \u201cEverything you could want in a test flight,\u201d said one of the narrators on the company\u2019s video of the launch.  The flight demonstrated that the rocket\u2019s design was able to withstand the stresses of so many engines operating simultaneously at supersonic speeds. That was considered one of the biggest hazards, along with separation of the two side boosters in space. The pair of boosters returned for a vertical landing not far from the historic pad from which Apollo astronauts lifted off for lunar exploits. The central part of the rocket crashed, however, instead of landing vertically as planned on a floating platform.  But because the company previously pulled off some 20 similar landings by spent boosters, the single failure was more of a blemish than a significant setback to Tuesday\u2019s flight. SpaceX landed two of its three reusable rocket boosters at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. on Tuesday. Photo: Getty Images"]
["Technology", "Large, reusable rockets such as the Falcon Heavy are ideal for deep-space transport from a cost perspective, according to Howard McCurdy, a space historian who teaches at American University. \u201cThat\u2019s where the heavy-lift design truly shines,\u201d he said before the launch. Given President Donald Trump\u2019s official policy of combining federal and private assets to explore the Moon, Mr. McCurdy called the SpaceX rocket \u201ca very important step in that direction.\u201d The flight prompted repeated applause and cheering among SpaceX employees, particularly because Mr. Musk for months had emphasized the risks and played down the likelihood of success. Just the day before, he had said he considered chances of pulling off the demonstration flight to be roughly 50-50. Using a complicated maneuver that had the dummy payload coasting through a section of space with high radiation levels for about six hours, the engine on the rocket\u2019s upper stage ignited for the third and last time to send the car into a further orbit than planned. On Twitter, Mr. Musk indicated the Tesla would reach the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. SpaceX has revolutionized the launch business by vertically integrating operations, slashing prices and reusing the main engines and lower stage of its existing workhorse rockets, the Falcon 9 fleet. But throughout the years, Mr. Musk has remained focused on a longer-term goal: devising mammoth rockets and spacecraft able to eventually establish colonies on Mars."]
["Technology", "The Falcon Heavy was conceived around the beginning of the decade to carry both heavy payloads and people into orbit around Earth, and as a steppingstone to the next generation of rockets with enough thrust to roam the solar system. But on Monday, Mr. Musk surprised the aerospace community by disclosing that the company\u2019s current heavy-lift champion, composed of three Falcon 9 boosters, likely will be reserved for unmanned missions. Still, the Falcon Heavy could provide a cut-rate price to get the heaviest commercial and U.S. government payloads into orbit. SpaceX has evolved quickly since it was founded in 2002 with a handful of employees working out of offices in a converted warehouse, near a strip mall in a Los Angeles suburb.  Today, Mr. Musk oversees a payroll with more than 5,000 employees at five locations spanning the U.S. plus three launch sites. The SpaceX team has sketched out plans intended to get its privately funded, reusable vehicles to Mars a decade or more ahead of those being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. SpaceX struggled through three unsuccessful attempts to launch its Falcon 1 rocket, a tiny, underpowered booster compared with later versions, before finally sending one into orbit in 2008. Six years later, the company lost a Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the international space station after exploded shortly after takeoff. A year later, a Falcon 9 exploded on the launchpad during routine ground tests, destroying a corporate communications satellite and casting a pall over SpaceX\u2019s plans as well as the budding commercial space industry."]
["Technology", "But Mr. Musk and his team bounced back from all those setbacks, by redesigning part of the Falcon 9\u2019s fuel system and demonstrating resolve to rev up the tempo of launches.  \u201cWe did learn our lessons from both of those\u201d Falcon 9 accidents, Hans Koenigsmann,  who heads SpaceX\u2019s reliability efforts, told a House panel last month. \u201cWe improved the vehicle.\u201d Had Tuesday\u2019s launch gone badly, commercial and U.S. government customers still would have been able to rely on a number of fallback options to put their heaviest future payloads into orbit.

Unlike that wave, in which drug companies merged into unwieldy giants, the new generation of deals is narrower, focused on transactions that create businesses capable of competing as leaders in their fields, rather than simply staking a presence.  \"M&A is a strategy to be used sparingly,\" said Glaxo Chief Executive Andrew Witty on a conference call Tuesday. \"But it has an extremely valuable role to play if you can find targeted transactions which allow you to strengthen in the places where you have long-term competitive advantage.\" Valeant seeks to buy Allergan, the maker of Botox wrinkle treatment.Bloomberg News Becoming more focused has helped create value for investors.

Valeant sees potential cost savings of $2.5 billion if its pairs up with Allergan, while also expanding the portfolio of products it can sell. The Novartis-Glaxo transactions fall squarely in the new style of deal-making, allowing each company to build on its strengths, while removing smaller noncompetitive businesses.  William Ackman Since former Chairman Daniel Vasella left Novartis last year, Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has repeatedly said he wanted to refocus Novartis on areas in which it has the scale to compete, rather than maintain small presences in a host of markets.

Analysts at Sanford C.

Basel-based Novartis will acquire Glaxo's oncology unit for around $14.5 billion, adding strength to the company's already potent lineup of cancer products. After the deal closes, Novartis will get roughly a fifth of its nearly $54 billion in estimated annual revenue from cancer drugs.

Ms. Kulhoff said Novartis's risk profile would increase \"slightly\" because of the new setup, but said the challenges, such as patent expirations that the company is facing or will face in the future, are manageable.

Those four areas will account for roughly 70% of the British company's total sales. . Glaxo said about 14% of its remaining sales will come from older products, and added that it is \"currently reviewing this portfolio to ensure the group evaluates all options to maximize its value.\" Glaxo will take charge of the combined consumer-health operation, which will be one of the world's largest over-the-counter drugs businesses, with annual revenue of around \u00a36.5 billion ($10.9 billion). Glaxo will own 63.5% of the business, which will be run by its current consumer-health head, Emma Walmsley.

["Technology", "In January, Apple sued Qualcomm in the Southern District of California over its licensing practices, alleging the leading supplier of chips for smartphones demanded unfair terms for its technology. Apple later filed suits in several overseas markets, including the United Kingdom, China, Japan and Taiwan. In addition to ruling against Qualcomm in the contract manufacturers\u2019 case, Judge Gonzalo Curiel denied Qualcomm\u2019s motion to unify Apple\u2019s overseas suits. Apple said it was pleased with the decision, adding, \u201cQualcomm must establish the fair value of its technology and defend its business practices in court.\u201d A Qualcomm spokeswoman said, \u201cWhile we are disappointed by today\u2019s rulings, we recognize that the motions involved high procedural hurdles.\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s preliminary injunction motion sought to force the contract manufacturers to pay royalties as its legal dispute with Apple continued. It had tried to convince the court it faced irreparable harm if the manufacturers -- Taiwan-based Compal Electronics Inc.,\n            Foxconn Technology\n            \n      Group, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp. -- continued to withhold those payments.  Florian Mueller,  an independent intellectual-property analyst, said it was difficult for the company, which has a market capitalization of $74.43 billion, to argue the business would suffer long-term damage if payments were withheld while the case continued. \u201cAny other decision than this one would have been a surprise,\u201d Mr. Mueller said."]
["Technology", "Qualcomm collects a royalty on nearly every smartphone sold world-wide. It owns patents deemed essential to implementing cellular-communication standards, obligating the company to license such technology fairly and widely. Qualcomm says its patents relate to cellular devices as a whole, not just its chips, and thus charges a percentage of the price of an entire device.  The company\u2019s licensees and rivals, though, say Qualcomm\u2019s royalty rates are unreasonably high. Apple argues Qualcomm\u2019s practice allows it to benefit from unrelated technologies added to the iPhone, such as its Touch ID a fingerprint-verification system.  Qualcomm was paid $10 an iPhone by Apple\u2019s manufacturers, according to analysts\u2019 estimates, before the companies began withholding all royalty payments earlier this year. The withheld payments hit Qualcomm hard in its most recent quarter, triggering a 40% decline in profit from a year earlier.  In May, Qualcomm had sought to blunt potential losses by suing the manufacturers for failing to pay royalties after Apple stopped reimbursing the companies. The manufacturers, who make iPhones or iPads, fired back in July with a countersuit.  Separately, Qualcomm had sought to block Apple\u2019s efforts to bring similar lawsuits overseas. The judge\u2019s decision allows those cases to continue, forcing Qualcomm to argue its royalty practices are fair in at least four other countries.  Corrections & Amplifications   A federal judge denied Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit against Apple Inc.\u2019s leading manufacturers. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the judge denied Qualcomm\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit."]

["NFL", "Public funding of sports stadiums, and a tax exemption on municipal bonds that often underpin such deals, has come under fire from members of both parties, including President Donald Trump,  in recent years.

The countries worst affected, including South Sudan, Somalia and northern Nigeria, are plagued by civil war. But even in relatively stable regions, rising inflation and foreign-exchange shortages have exacerbated conditions. Falling commodity prices across central and southern Africa have sent currencies more than 30% lower against the dollar in the past six months, spiking inflation and undermining purchasing power. \u201cThe corn price doubled again [in March],\u201d said Sarah Mweene,  a 38-year-old taxi driver from Lusaka, copper-rich Zambia\u2019s capital, where in March eight people died in a stampede of thousands of people who were lined up for emergency food rations. \u201cWe can only afford one meal a day for the children.\u2026It\u2019s never happened before.\u201d"]

Mobs forced the stadium\u2019s steel doors open, snatching cooking oil, corn meal, salt and anything else they could find.  The government is seeking an emergency $1.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan to aid the economy. Agriculture Minister Dora Siliya said shortages and rising prices are the government\u2019s big challenge, but hopes the situation will stabilize in the coming months, when supplies from the 2017 harvest start to trickle in.  To be sure, commodity prices have moderately recovered since last year, but they remain more than 50% below their 2013 peak, according to the World Bank. While the commodity crash has forced countries like Nigeria and Angola to put more effort into creating sustainable agricultural production, many remain net food importers, exposing citizens to shocks of weakened currencies. In Uganda, meanwhile, a historic drought and surging food prices have forced thousands from the countryside to beg on the streets of the capital.

He owes a local commercial bank around $6,000 and as sales dwindle, he can no longer raise enough money to pay for a monthly truckload of grain supplies. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I will be able to afford rent,\u201d the 40-year-old said, pointing at empty shelves. \u201cWe have raised prices to meet costs, but sales keep dropping.\u201d Sliding currencies and a shortage of increasingly expensive dollars has some countries cutting back on food imports and freezing efforts to replenish stocks. The bulk of food imports into sub-Saharan Africa are dollar-denominated, which pushes up trade deficits and exposes poor economies to food-price inflation. The worst harvests in three decades have also sent prices around 50% higher than their five-year average across many of the continent\u2019s eastern and southern states, snaring millions of Africans never before affected by hunger, according to Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a U.S.-funded research group.

As a lawyer, he worked at various times defending Turkey at the European Court of Human Rights and served as a judge on a United Nations war crimes tribunal.  \u201cHow can a society go between such polar opposites this quickly and this much?\u201d Mr. Akay wrote in a prison note viewed by The Wall Street Journal. More than 3,000 judges, prosecutors and court staff have been dismissed or arrested since summer, crippling work at court houses around the country, Turkish criminal and civil lawyers said."]
["Experiential", "Turkey\u2019s Constitutional Court, the nation\u2019s highest, has received tens of thousands of appeals from citizens who believe they have been unfairly detained or fired from their work since the failed coup. Two judges on the high court were arrested this summer, accused of being Gulen supporters. Prosecutors haven\u2019t charged Mr. Akay but have argued for his continued detention as they investigate users of the messaging app, called ByLock. Turkish intelligence officials have told the Journal that ByLock wasn\u2019t used by the coup plotters, and that by last year the app had fallen out favor among Gulenists. Even so, authorities have compiled a list of more than 180,000 ByLock users as part of the government\u2019s investigation into other alleged plots. Around 9,000 of these alleged users have been detained. Another Turkish intelligence official said Mr. Akay\u2019s career and lifestyle didn\u2019t match the usual profile of a member of the organization. But the official said Mr. Akay\u2019s extensive use of the app indicated he was a \u201cfunctional\u201d member of the group. Mr. Akay has denied being a Gulenist. Mr. Akay\u2019s lawyers couldn\u2019t view his case file, they were told, for reasons of national security. They don\u2019t believe it contains any evidence of wrongdoing\u2014only that Mr. Akay downloaded ByLock. \u201cThere is no proximity between Judge Akay and the coup, or Judge Akay and terrorism,\u201d said Yaman Akdeniz,  a Turkish constitutional law expert and one of Mr. Akay\u2019s defense lawyers. \u201cIn most countries, there are legal statutes that make possession of certain items a crime unto themselves, like child pornography or hard drugs. But there is nowhere that I know of where possession of an app indicates criminal behavior.\u201d"]
["Experiential", "The Turkish Justice Minister\u2019s office and the prosecutor assigned Mr. Akay\u2019s case declined to comment, citing privacy grounds. Mr. Akay\u2019s release isn\u2019t expected soon. The loyalty of any judge who frees a detainee in the current political climate would come under immediate suspicion, his lawyers said. For now, Mr. Akay wakes before dawn to write letters home and fill his diary. To escape the monotony, he walks in the exercise yard, where he can escape in memories of his family and the narrow streets of Istanbul\u2019s historic quarter, of a life abroad, in Paris, in New York and in Africa. Strengthening Turkey\u2019s rule of law was a goal drilled into Mr. Akay from an early age, his family and colleagues said. He was raised in Ankara, and his politically active father, also a lawyer, helped build the secular, anti-Communist party now known as the Nationalist Movement Party, or MHP. Mr. Akay avoided politics, and after passing the bar went into private practice in the capital. In 1985, he met his future wife, then a graphic designer, at a dinner party hosted by mutual friends. Over cigarettes and glasses of Turkey\u2019s anise-flavored alcohol raki, they discussed politics and philosophy. Alahan Akay said her future husband wasn\u2019t put off because she was a single working mother with a young son: \u201cHe had a progressive and open mind.\u201d On weekends, Mr. Akay, who lived in Ankara, began visiting his future wife, who lived in Istanbul, a five-hour drive each way."]
["Experiential", "Once married, Mr. Akay followed his wife\u2019s advice and joined the Turkish foreign service, where her brother worked. The couple, who later had a daughter, sought adventure in a cosmopolitan life abroad. In 1989, they moved to New York City, where Mr. Akay worked as the legal attach\u00e9 for Turkey\u2019s mission at the United Nations in Manhattan. The family lived nearby, on 2nd Avenue and 43rd Street, and the children attended local Catholic schools. The family toured the U.S. by car on vacations, Mrs. Akay said. They tried new cuisine, like crabs from the Chesapeake Bay in Baltimore. Their son became a long-suffering fan of the New York Jets. In the mid-1990s, Mr. Akay was posted to Strasbourg, France, where he defended Turkey at proceedings at the European Court of Human Rights. Turkish citizens, mostly Kurds, alleged they were tortured and abused by the security forces during some of the bloodiest years of insurgency by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. Mr. Akay also participated in debates at the Council of Europe, the body that oversees international human-rights conventions, which the newly independent Eastern European states were eager to join. Jon Ivanovich,  the Macedonian ambassador there at the time, said he and Mr. Akay became friends after hours spent talking about the transition from authoritarian societies to nations where civil liberties were enshrined.  \u201cHe was proud of his nation and was a real believer in Turkey\u2019s rightful place in Europe,\u201d Mr. Ivanovich said. Continuing coverage of a nation in crisis"]
["Experiential", "By the early 2000s, after another tour in Strasbourg, the Foreign Ministry nominated him as a judge for a tribunal set up by the United Nations Security Council to adjudicate alleged war crimes during the Rwanda genocide. In 2009, he moved to Arusha, Tanzania, and ruled over five cases there. Mr. Akay took a break from his legal career and accepted a two-year post, starting in 2012, as Turkey\u2019s first ambassador to Burkina Faso. He was motivated by retirement worries after a life in civil service: An ambassadorship would significantly increase his government pension, his family said. Turkey\u2019s National Intelligence Agency, known by its Turkish initials MIT, said the spy agency is now examining whether Mr. Akay was directed by Gulenists to take the post in Burkina Faso, or whether he used his position to further Gulenist ambitions, according to a person familiar with the situation. MIT believes supporters of Mr. Gulen worked for years to illegally influence state policy, including the expansion of Turkish embassies across Africa to boost their commercial enterprises. Mr. Akay represented Turkish business interests impartially while serving as ambassador, his lawyer said. Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers number in the millions, and businessmen affiliated with the cleric include those at some of Turkey\u2019s largest companies. Affiliation with Mr. Gulen or his followers\u2019 businesses wasn\u2019t illegal and Messrs Gulen and Erdogan for many years had been political allies. In May, Turkey\u2019s National Security Council labeled the Gulenists an armed terrorist network. And after July\u2019s coup, such relationships exposed many in Turkey to arrest with little or no warning."]
["Experiential", "Mr. Akay returned to Turkey in 2014 and retired from the foreign service around his 65th birthday. In 2015, he took up his judicial duties at the appellate tribunal based at The Hague and formed by the U.N. to hear cases related to Rwanda and former Yugoslavia war crimes tribunals. Over the summer, Mr. Akay was deliberating a motion filed by convicted war criminal Radovan Karadic when rogue elements of the Turkish military tried to overthrow the government. He and his wife were at home on the island of Buyukada, known as the Martha\u2019s Vineyard of Istanbul. At least 270 people died during the coup. Jet fighters bombed parliament in Ankara and tanks fired on civilians in Istanbul. Days later, the government called a state of emergency. Officials said they needed extraordinary powers to combat traitorous citizens, as well as Islamic State and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party\u2014two groups that have killed about 300 people in suicide attacks so far this year.  The couple struggled to make sense of the violence. Mr. Akay became disenchanted with some of his friends in his secular social set who had rooted for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s downfall, his family said. In conversations over drinks, Mr. Akay was clear: Military rule was never a better alternative to a democratically elected government. For the rest of the summer, life for the Akays was relaxed. The couple baby-sat grandchildren and swam at their beach club. In September, they flew to Israel with Jewish friends and visited Jerusalem for the first time."]
["Experiential", "Three days after their return, on Sept. 19, Mrs. Akay was cooking pasta for lunch when the doorbell rang. A dozen or so police entered the house, handcuffed Mr. Akay and declared him a national-security threat.  A table set at the home of Aydin Akay, a Turkish lawyer and judge who is being held by authorities as a terror suspect. Police confiscated electronic devices and picked through the 2,000 or so books in Mr. Akay\u2019s home library, which was filled with legal case studies, Paris guide books and histories of Western philosophy. They confiscated two nonfiction books, including one about Mr. Gulen. Police moved Mr. Akay to Sincan, where suspected senior coup plotters are held. For five days, counterterror police questioned his use of ByLock and his professional associations abroad, according to his lawyers and a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s statement viewed by the Journal. Mr. Akay told them he had downloaded the app and used it in 2015, along with other chat apps such as WhatsApp. He said he used it to communicate with friends in Burkina Faso about personal matters. Mr. Akay denied to authorities any association with Mr. Gulen or the coup, calling it absurd to suspect him of membership in a religious organization trying to subvert democracy.  \u201cIt is evident from my social, cultural and family life that I can\u2019t be thought of in the same sentence as\u201d the Gulenist terror group, he said, according to a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s report viewed by the Journal."]
["Experiential", "During a Sept. 28 court appearance, Mr. Akay\u2019s legal team argued for his release for lack of evidence. They later said the arrest violated the diplomatic immunity granted Mr. Akay as a U.N. official. The judge denied his release. Turkey has told the U.N. Mr. Akay stands accused of \u201cvery serious\u201d crimes and that any immunity would apply solely to his duties as a tribunal judge, a Foreign Ministry official said. \u201cWe keep hoping every day there is going to be a change, that we will wake up and the country will go back to normal,\u201d said Mrs. Akay, who now lives with her son and his family in Istanbul. \u201cBut the reality is that my husband is caught in a spider\u2019s web. For now, there is no escape.\u201d In Sincan, Mr. Akay shares a cell with five men, who like him, had been among Turkey\u2019s elite: judges, military officers and academics. Sharing two beds and two mattresses on the floor means the six men sleep poorly, sometimes in shifts. Most of his cell mates wake before dawn for morning prayers. Mr. Akay uses those rare moments of solitude to write letters home. They are read by a prison censor, so Mr. Akay writes as blandly as the prison stew. One described how prisoners sometimes share snacks bought at the prison store.  Mr. Akay\u2019s morning walks in the prison yard help relieve his worries\u2014about his wife, who survived a bout of breast cancer\u2014and offer reminders of happier times such as the safari the family took to the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, according to letters viewed by the Journal."]
["Experiential", "He rarely watches the TV that serves his cell block, he wrote: The scenes of Istanbul trigger a painful homesickness. He is allowed family visits but has asked his wife and daughter to stay away. He is afraid seeing them would crumble the stoicism that shields him day to day. Only his son, Kerem, also an attorney, visits the prison outside Ankara. The weekly journey reverses the route Mr. Akay would take while courting Mrs. Akay. It is now a trip often filled with dread, the son said, for \u201cthe uncertainty over whether it will be my last chance to see him.\u201d At the end of October, Mr. Akay\u2019s lawyers lost an appeal for his release on bail. They have filed an appeal to the Turkish Constitutional Court. Their next move is to take Mr. Akay\u2019s case to the European Court of Human Rights, where the lawyer had once defended Turkey.  His family struggles to keep faith in the legal system that Mr. Akay spent a career championing. Mrs. Akay hasn\u2019t returned to the island home where she and her husband had hoped to grow old together. The table is still set in blue china plates for a lunch never shared.

Now, they are trying to become more like Netflix\u2014sinking money into original content to boost subscription revenue. China\u2019s most valuable company, Tencent, for example, saw its content costs and agency fees rise by 44% to $1.1 billion last quarter, mostly because of spending on videos. E-commerce giant Alibaba lost nearly about $1.5 billion on digital entertainment in the past year, stemming mainly from its video website Youku Tudou. Baidu, which runs China\u2019s biggest search engine, arguably has the most at stake, having fallen behind the other two in investor popularity: Tencent\u2019s share price has almost tripled in three years, yet Baidu\u2019s shares are only 20% higher. While Tencent runs China\u2019s most popular social network,\n            WeChat\n,\n      and Alibaba operates the country\u2019s premier online shopping forum, Taobao, Baidu\u2019s search business has stalled, in part because of damaging domestic scandals.

["Heard on the Street", "Still, the odds seem tilted against Baidu. While its revenue rose 7% in the first quarter, Alibaba and Tencent posted gains of more than 50%. Their stronger core businesses should allow them to splurge more on videos, even if they prove unprofitable for a while, and the robust user communities they have already built in their main businesses should also give them a leg up.

Wealthy customers often remain with their banks when moving cash into investment products. But banks want to ensure enough of their customers keep money on deposit rather than in similar investment products they offer, in part because customer funds on deposit are more freely available for the banks to invest in higher-margin loans. While deposits can be lent out at higher rates for mortgages and other longer-term loans, for instance, dollars in money-market funds typically are lent against short-term instruments, generating far less income. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have the deposits than the money-market funds,\u201d Brian Foran,  an analyst at Autonomous Research, said of the banks."]

The shares have been on a tear since last year\u2019s election and recently picked up steam as prospects for a tax overhaul brightened. Still, interest rates paid on deposits overall are still historically low, and deposit rates for average customers have tended to tick up more slowly than for others. At Bank of America, savings accounts\u2014generally the lowest-yielding interest account\u2014still pay just 0.01% on average. But wealthier customers are only the latest to become more demanding. In the second quarter of 2017, banks said some big companies were also looking for higher interest rates. For now, average bank customers aren\u2019t clamoring for higher rates. Eventually, analysts expect that this wider group of depositors will also start to put pressure on banks, pushing bank rates higher. For now, John Shrewsberry,  finance chief at Wells Fargo, told analysts, retail-deposit sensitivity to interest rates has \u201cessentially been zero.\u201d Customers since the financial crisis are more focused on the reliability of their bank than getting a higher rate, KeyCorp CEO Beth Mooney said.

["Magazine/WSJ.

The building will draw approximately 80 percent of its power from solar panels on the roof and from fuel cells (and the remaining 20 percent from other sources of renewable energy); recycled wood has been used for much of the interior.

["Middle East News", "Rojava\u2019s continuing territorial expansion has alarmed Turkey, which is battling Kurdish separatists within its own borders and has pushed deeper into Syria to attack Islamic State forces and rein in the Syrian Kurds. The U.S. is stuck uncomfortably in the middle because it relies on Syrian Kurds to fight Islamic State yet considers Turkey a crucial ally. And as Rojava gets mightier and realizes long-held ambitions of self-rule for Kurds, some of its own people feel alienated by what they claim are heavy-handed tactics that feel reminiscent of the Syrian regime. Instead of helping Jude Hamo finish his junior year of college, his parents sold the family car and borrowed money to smuggle the 23-year-old to Germany so he wouldn\u2019t be drafted into the Kurdish armed forces fighting Islamic State. \u201cWe chose the lesser of two evils,\u201d says Jude\u2019s father, Radwan. The Kurds are one of the world\u2019s largest ethnic groups without an independent state, numbering about 30 million people across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Read More. Since late 2014, at least 6,000 young Syrian Kurds have been compelled to serve in the military, according to the regional administration\u2019s military ministry. More than two dozen died in battle. In addition, the opposition group Syrian Network for Human Rights said Rojava officials have arrested and forced into military service a total of 1,178 civilians, including 217 minors and 69 women."]
["Middle East News", "\u201cEveryone has to participate,\u201d said Akram Hisso,  former head of the Kurdish administration\u2019s executive council in one of the three Syrian provinces that form the self-proclaimed Rojava. \u201cThose who come out against the draft can go and sit in European refugee camps.\u201d Other sources of criticism include how the Kurdish administration, which established itself in early 2014, has cracked down on dissent, introduced an ideological school curriculum and consolidated power among one political party. Kurdish leaders say the draft, which has led to an exodus of young men like Mr. Hamo, and other policies are necessities in the fight against Islamic State. Other signs of Rojava\u2019s self-rule abound, from its opening of foreign offices in France, Germany, Sweden and Moscow to a constitution that embraces secularism and women\u2019s rights.

The country is partitioned between the Assad regime, Islamic State, rebel groups and Syrian Kurds, with each group trying to implement its own ideology and vision of governance. In neighboring Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan, recognized by the central government as an autonomous region since 2005, real independence remains elusive. Kurdistan wrestles with the Iraqi central government for a share of Iraq\u2019s budget, and Iraqi Kurdish leaders regularly threaten to secede."]
["Middle East News", "After decades of being marginalized under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his late father, the Kurds were allowed by Syria\u2019s authoritarian regime to have some self-rule as part of a strategy to keep them from joining the uprising that began in March 2011 and morphed into civil war. Government troops withdrew from historically Kurdish cities and towns in northeast Syria, and the Kurds then expanded their territory through conquests of land that had been seized by Islamic State. The ethnic minority\u2019s growing power has become a concern for the Assad regime, which launched airstrikes in mid-August on Kurdish forces in the northeastern city of Hasakah. In a written statement about the fighting, the Syrian army used language linking the Kurdish forces with a militant group designated by the U.S. and Turkey as a terrorist organization. Last week, Turkey supported Syrian rebels in a surprising cross-border offensive into northwestern Syria. The assault was aimed at pushing Islamic State forces from a strategic border town and halting the territorial gains of U.S.-backed Kurdish militants known as the YPG. U.S. officials say they have made clear to Kurdish forces that American military backing isn\u2019t equivalent to an endorsement of their political ambitions. Officials were angered when the YPG, viewed as the U.S.\u2019s most effective fighting force against Islamic State, seized more territory during the recent Manbij offensive than they agreed to beforehand, according to Vice President Joe Biden. Still, military support from the U.S. has stirred Kurdish aspirations and strained America\u2019s relationship with Turkey, a critical ally."]
["Middle East News", "\u201cIt was kind of a short-term tactical decision that could have longer-term strategic downsides, all in the name of saying we were making progress on Islamic State,\u201d says Robert Ford,  the U.S. ambassador to Syria when the uprising started. In March, Syrian Kurds announced the formation of a federation of Rojava\u2019s three regions in an assertion of self-rule. \u201cRojava will be the basis of establishing a federalist system in Syria,\u201d said Mr. Hisso. Washington and other Western governments rejected the move. Throughout Rojava, long-omnipresent photographs and statues of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his late father have been replaced by banners of YPG fighters killed in battle. Many Rojava residents call them martyrs. In the center of Amuda, a traffic circle adorned with a waving statue of Hafez al-Assad until it was torn down by protesters now has a statue of a woman who holds up a flame and carries a book and a few stalks of wheat. She is Rojava\u2019s own Lady Liberty. Behind the displays of independence, however, is an enduring dependence on the Syrian regime. The Kurdish administration relies on the regime to pay the majority of civil-servant salaries, issue high-school and college diplomas, and run the region\u2019s airport. Opposition parties say Kurdish leaders have arrested and beaten dissenters and shut down rival party headquarters. Rojava officials also banned two independent media outlets from operating freely. Elections originally scheduled for 2014 have been repeatedly postponed."]
["Middle East News", "\u201cAnything that has the hint of not working for their benefit, they ban it,\u201d says Imaad Omar Yusuf,  general coordinator for the opposition Kurd Youth Movement. \u201cSeventy percent of Kurds are against them.\u201d On Aug. 13, Rojava\u2019s police force arrested the president of the Kurdish National Council, an umbrella group of opposition parties, deported him to Iraq and threatened to kill him if he returns, the group said in a statement. Sinam Mohamad, foreign representative for Rojava, denies that anyone has been arrested or threatened because they are political dissenters. People detained or deported were guilty of criminal offenses, she says. The independent media outlets were engaged in \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cantagonizing the autonomous administration,\u201d Ms. Mohamad adds. \u201cAnd this is against the law.\u201d In some villages, Sunni Arab residents who fled as the YPG pushed out the Sunni extremists of Islamic State have been banned from returning to their homes, according to some former residents and Syrian Kurdish officials. Officials defend the ban on the grounds that Rojava is vulnerable to continuing attacks from Islamic State sleeper cells and sympathizers. Mass expulsions also are justified under tribal customs if one or two people in a family are members of Islamic State, say some Kurdish administration officials. \u201cNo matter what, we are a tribal culture. So if there are problems that happen between my tribe and another family, the family at the very least is expelled,\u201d says Takoshar Tulhildaan, a commanding officer in the Kurdish administration\u2019s security force."]
["Middle East News", "Fighters with the all-female YPJ militia shown in a propaganda photo released in March. Rojava\u2019s constitution embraces women\u2019s rights, and some teenage girls there have run away to join the militia group. Photo: Kurdishstruggle/Zuma Press Rojava\u2019s rise and emphasis on gender equality have encouraged some teenage girls to run away and join the YPG\u2019s all-female YPJ militia.  Marwan Hussein says his sister was lured into joining the YPJ by friends when she was 15. She was taken to the Qandil Mountains in Iraq, where the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, known as the PKK, maintains a base. Turkey, the U.S. and European Union have designated the PKK a terrorist group. She was allowed to come home for a visit late last year, and Mr. Hussein took his sister into hiding. YPG officials have said minors joined the militia without parental consent, though some were fleeing unstable homes. After being barred for decades by the Syrian regime from using the Kurdish language, Rojava leaders now require many schools to teach in Kurdish. That sparked a backlash from some parents and teachers who oppose the change. At the start of the 2015-16 school year, the Kurdish administration instituted a new curriculum mandating that Kurds, Arabs and Assyrians all be taught in their native language. Most teacher salaries are still paid by the Syrian regime, though, and it told teachers not to follow the new curriculum. That was seen as another attempt by the Syrian regime to undermine the Kurdish administration\u2019s authority."]
["Middle East News", "Teachers say they signed in every day during the school year to get paid but didn\u2019t teach any students. Syrian Kurdish officials brought in replacement teachers, but they were poorly trained. \u201cEverything they do is to prove themselves,\u201d one first-grade teacher says about Rojava\u2019s administration. \u201cBecause the regime does it one way, they do it another way just to prove they are a country.\u201d Salha Abdulrahman, the mother of Jude Hamo, who fled to Germany to avoid the draft, says the Kurdish curriculum hurts students because universities across Syria still teach solely in Arabic. Residents are fleeing \u201cbecause of the schools and the economic situation and\u2026the draft,\u201d says Ms. Abdulrahman, an elementary-school teacher. Even with her son safely in Germany, the family has continued pushing back against what they call the authoritarian Kurdish administration. At dawn one morning in June, security officers with Rojava\u2019s administration raided dozens of homes looking for men wanted for mandatory conscription. Jude\u2019s father joined other residents protesting the raids and was arrested. Rojava doesn\u2019t allow protests without a permit from the administration or police, says Ms. Mohamad, the foreign representative for Rojava. Ms. Abdulrahman says she didn\u2019t know where her husband was until people arrested with him had been released. He says he was held for 44 days without being told the reason for his arrest. \u201cPeople say if the border with Turkey was open, we would all be in Germany,\u201d Ms. Abdulrahman says.

Through a series of increasingly bold acquisitions, followed by fiscal discipline and tightly controlled investment, Mr. Tan, the chip industry\u2019s most visible deal maker, has been helping drive profit growth at Broadcom, piling up cash and paying out dividends at a prodigious pace. Mr. Tan\u2019s approach brings kudos from Wall Street, but it doesn\u2019t always sit well with his former employees or current customers of his latest deal target, the chip maker\n            Qualcomm\n Inc.\n      \u2014particularly those who think he skimps on research and development."]
["Technology", "In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Tan defended the methods he used to transform a company once valued at $2.7 billion, Avago Technologies Ltd., into the $105 billion juggernaut known as Broadcom. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting together a very good portfolio of product franchises to create a lot of value for our customers, shareholders and employees,\u201d Mr. Tan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no long-term vision or ambition other than that.\u201d In Broadcom\u2019s fiscal year that ended in October, Mr. Tan boosted revenue by 33%, profit by 39% and free cash flow by 58%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. He doubled Broadcom\u2019s per-share dividend for 2017 and raised it a further 72% for 2018. Mr. Tan owns a 0.026% equity stake in Broadcom worth $28.1 million, according to Capital IQ. He also has the right to exercise options to purchase more than 2.4 million shares by mid-March, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Wall Street is eating it up. In the past five years, Broadcom shares have expanded more than sevenfold, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index more than tripled.  A relentless drive to build his company leaves Mr. Tan with little room for anything else, friends and associates said, although he has a taste for richly marbled Wagyu beef and high-performance cars. He commutes to San Jose, Calif., from San Mateo, Calif., in a Tesla, usually leaving his Aston Martin in the garage."]
["Technology", "Mr. Tan, who came to the U.S. from Malaysia in 1971 at age 18, held senior executive roles at tech and other companies before he was named CEO of Avago in 2006. Since then, he has built Broadcom\u2019s portfolio of smartphone and networking chips through a nearly $50 billion shopping spree for a dozen companies with as many divestments.  If he has his way, his roster soon will include market-leading products from Qualcomm, a longstanding innovator that has lately been beset by challenges from customers, primarily\n            Apple\n Inc.,\n      and regulators around the world. Broadcom and Qualcomm have been locked in a standoff since early November, when Mr. Tan bid $105 billion to combine the two companies, an offer Qualcomm rejected. A merger would be the largest-ever tech tie-up, giving Broadcom chips that connect smartphones to cellular networks and forging the No. 3 semiconductor company by revenue. Qualcomm shareholders are set to vote on Broadcom-nominated directors at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting in March.  The companies take markedly different approaches to the chip business. Qualcomm, a San Diego smartphone specialist, is working to expand into laptops, servers and new fields such as virtual reality. It was first to dedicate computing power to artificial intelligence in mobile processors and has played a central role in forming the next-generation cellular standard known as 5G. Its proposed purchase of\n            NXP Semiconductors\n            \n      NV, which it expects to complete early this year, would open a path into the emerging market for self-driving cars."]
["Technology", "Mr. Tan, on the other hand, views Broadcom as a high-performance chassis into which he can bolt purchases of established products that have leading technology and market share, with an emphasis on those that appeal to his current customer base. He is a relentless cost-cutter, spending primarily to maintain his lead and avoiding investments that don\u2019t have a clear payoff.  Syed Ali,  chief executive of chip maker\n            Cavium\n Inc.,\n      which both competes and collaborates with Broadcom, lauded Mr. Tan for his rapid-fire decision-making and command of operational details. \u201cI hate competing against him,\u201d Mr. Ali said. Mr. Tan\u2019s attitude toward innovation, though, worries some Qualcomm customers that depend on its technology to give them an edge. Executives at Chinese handset makers Oppo Electronics Corp. and Vivo Electronics Corp., recently expressed concern that Broadcom might trim Qualcomm\u2019s R&D spending on fundamental cellular technology. Broadcom\u2019s options are either to raise Qualcomm\u2019s prices or cut its costs, a Vivo executive said. \u201cEither choice will pose disadvantages for us.\u201d  Wang Xiang,  senior vice president of strategic cooperation at Xiaomi Corp., another mobile-phone maker, said he was evaluating the implications of a Broadcom-Qualcomm tie-up. \u201cI think we care more if the technology partner is motivated enough to do technology innovation,\u201d he said."]
["Technology", "Mr. Tan, in his dozen years as CEO, has spent six times as much on acquisitions as on R&D, while in that period Qualcomm spent nowhere near as much on acquisition as on R&D, according to data from Broadcom, Qualcomm and S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the past 12 months, Broadcom spent 19% of revenue on R&D, while Qualcomm spent 25%. Mr. Tan has said he has heard from many Qualcomm customers who support his proposed merger. He said he believes he spends more than necessary to maintain leadership in his core \u201cfranchises.\u201d \u201cFrankly, we overinvest to ensure we are way ahead of No. 2 or No. 3,\u201d he said. Some former Broadcom employees worried Mr. Tan\u2019s strategy would prove unsustainable in the long run. One former executive said his targets\u2019 R&D investments, made before being acquired by Broadcom, often take years to bear fruit\u2014so if Broadcom doesn\u2019t continue to invest at the same level, it must keep buying ever-larger companies to achieve its target margins. Mr. Tan said he acquires only companies that offer opportunities to drive growth and profit. A former employee of Broadcom\u2019s wireless division said Mr. Tan stifled innovation by cutting products that weren\u2019t already established leaders and by skimping on product development unless a customer requested a new capability\u2014and agreed to pay for it. \u201cThe everyday question was: How long can we go on like this?\u201d the former employee said. Mr. Tan calls that \u201ca classic engineer\u2019s biased view\u201d\u2014that the engineer\u2019s own solution is best. He credited Broadcom\u2019s ability to spot winning projects with keeping R&D spending down."]

Efforts to reach Prince al-Waleed were unsuccessful. People close to him have said he maintains his innocence. In a video interview with Reuters aired Saturday, the prince said his business was a \u201cclean operation\u201d and that he would retain control of his company, Kingdom Holding Co. Others released on Saturday and Sunday, the senior Saudi official said, include construction magnate Bakr bin Laden,  whose company has been effectively nationalized, and media investor Waleed al-Ibrahim, who founded Mideast television network MBC. Neither could be reached for comment. The Saudi official said those let go after months of confinement had signed documents admitting wrongdoing.

It was unclear what deal was eventually reached. Another royal family member, Prince Miteb bin Abdullah,  settled for $1 billion in November, the Journal has reported.

["Middle East News", "On Sunday, the senior Saudi official said about 40 remaining holdouts could go on trial. Some have been moved from the luxury Ritz hotel where detainees were initially held, to the maximum-security al-Hayer prison south of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. These latest developments mark a new phase in Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s efforts to reorder the kingdom\u2019s elite as part of a broader move to remake Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-reliant economy and ease religious restrictions that have long defined the country\u2019s conservative society.  Saudi government officials have described the recent crackdown as a campaign against corruption and vowed that the proceeds would help ordinary Saudis. Human-rights groups have called the moves a power grab by the crown prince, who was named heir to the throne in June.

Some of the adviser\u2019s clients were present.  \u201cWhat can you do for your country?\u201d the prince asked the men, according to the adviser. The octogenarian king has turned over the day-to-day affairs of the country to his son. Saudi officials didn\u2019t answer questions about the meetings."]
["Middle East News", "At the time, the government was preparing a record-high proposed budget of $260 billion that would impose new taxes on regular Saudis. Late on the night of Nov. 4, dozens of Saudi princes, government officials and businesspeople were summoned for what they were told was an urgent meeting with Prince Mohammed at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton. Instead of a meeting with the prince, however, the elite Saudis found themselves in a makeshift prison. It was soon clear: They had \u201cto cooperate to get out and pledge allegiance\u201d to the crown prince, said a person close to detainees.

["Middle East News", "He said he was allowed to exercise, given access to food compatible with his vegan diet and allowed to make calls to his company, Kingdom Holding, a Saudi-based conglomerate. After news of his release, the company\u2019s share price closed up 10% on Sunday in Riyadh trading. It had fallen 21% after his November arrest, though it recovered from some of those losses in recent weeks. Other detained businessmen have had to give up substantial stakes in their businesses. Mr. bin Laden, chairman of construction company Saudi Binladin Group, was released after agreeing to surrender his stake in the company to the government, according to the senior Saudi official.  Saudi Binladin Group said it will remain a private-sector company, though it has said some shareholders had possibly agreed to transfer some of the company\u2019s shares to the Saudi government.  The agreement marks the end of Mr. bin Laden\u2019s decades-old role at the helm of the construction group tasked with handling many of the kingdom\u2019s most prestigious and complex projects.

The remainder would see their tax burden change by less than $100.  The plan cuts taxes by about $1.5 trillion over a decade. It increases to the standard deduction and child tax credit, but some households would end up paying more because they would lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes."]

["Middle East News", "Rebel troops fired on civilians on the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul, killing three, as jets streaked over the city, according to the agency. Military leaders supporting the president ordered an F-16 jet fighter in the capital to shoot down a helicopter being used by the rebels. (More: Turkey\u2019s Erdogan Reasserts Control After Attempted Coup) The government said the situation was largely under control by Saturday morning. Anadolu reported that 1,374 military personnel were detained across Turkey as part of an investigation into the coup attempt. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim,  speaking on CNN Turk, said one rebel general was shot dead. Mr. Erdogan flew back from a vacation resort to Atat\u00fcrk International Airport in his stronghold of Istanbul, where thousands defied the rebel troops and swarmed their tanks to greet him.  Speaking to live television, the president vowed to deliver a decisive blow to coup leaders and urged civilians to resist the rebels. \u201cThose who stain the military\u2019s reputation must leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process has started today and it will continue.\u201d Forces loyal to the president rescued the country\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Hulusi Akar, who had been held captive by coup plotters, the president\u2019s office said. Mr. Akar\u2019s refusal to back the coup was likely a key reason why the military takeover quickly unraveled. The head of Turkey\u2019s intelligence service, Hakan Fidan, was also said to be safe, despite efforts by coup forces to storm the intelligence headquarters in Ankara."]
["Middle East News", "Hours into the coup, it became clear that the military wasn\u2019t united in attempting to overthrow the government. Key military leaders, including the chief of general staff, stood with Mr. Erdogan in defending the government. Yet gunfights around the military headquarters in Ankara continued.  A stream of opposition leaders came out and backed the democratically elected government in the nation of 79 million, a key ally in the fight against Islamic State, host to more than 2,000 U.S. military personnel and a partner stemming the flood of refugees to Europe.  The White House called on all parties in Turkey to \u201csupport the democratically elected government of Turkey, show restraint and avoid any violence or bloodshed,\u201d shortly after President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken by phone.   The coup attempt began around 8 p.m. local time. In Istanbul, Turkish rebel troops closed the city\u2019s landmark Bosporus Bridge, which was lit up in the colors of the French flag in solidarity with victims of the terrorist attack in Nice, France. An attack was launched on the police special forces loyal to Mr. Erdogan on the outskirts of Ankara, where explosions were heard by residents. The rebels then stormed the state-run television station and forced it off the air. The military factions leading the coup attempt said they were seizing control to \u201cre-establish constitutional order\u201d as they moved to take over all government responsibilities. "]
["Middle East News", "But top military leaders backed Mr. Erdogan and fought back against the rebel troops, according to Mr. Yildirim, the prime minister, triggering deadly clashes. Crowds swarmed the streets in support of Mr. Erdogan, with some people lying in front of tanks in protest. The government was able to regain control of the state-run station before dawn Saturday. Officials close to Mr. Erdogan said elements of the Gendarmerie General Command and the Air Force were behind the attempted coup. The officials said key elements of the Turkish Army and Navy remained behind Mr. Erdogan, including the First and Third armies as well as Turkish special forces.  The president, government officials and some military generals cast the coup attempt as yet another plot by the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Turkish cleric who once was a key ally of Mr. Erdogan but has in the past three years turned into his arch-nemesis.  \u201cThey have targeted [state intelligence agency] MIT, the presidency and the prime ministry,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in an earlier televised statement, which his spokesman said was made in a \u201csafe\u201d location. \u201cThey have kidnapped the secretary-general of the presidency. I speak to the military commanders: I\u2019m sure you share the nation\u2019s values. But maybe you have had friends among you who do not share the values of this nation. They were following orders from Pennsylvania.\u201d  Mr. Gulen\u2019s network denounced both the coup attempt and allegations that the imam was behind it. \u201cWe condemn any military intervention in domestic politics of Turkey,\u201d said the Alliance for Shared Values, a New York organization affiliated with Mr. Gulen. "]
["Middle East News", "Mr. Yildirim called for an extraordinary meeting in parliament to be held later Saturday. He also appealed to people to stay on the streets until the coup attempt was totally crushed.  The whereabouts of Turkey\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Hulusi Akar, wasn\u2019t clear, and officials didn\u2019t provide any details on his location. The coup attempt stunned many political analysts, who have spent the last decade charting Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tightening grip on power; which appeared to include a pliant military command headed by handpicked loyalists. Since securing a landslide election victory in 2002, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party placed an overhaul of the arch-secularist military\u2014which toppled four civilian governments in six decades\u2014at the cornerstone of government policy.  In the early hours of Saturday, as conflicting information poured in from the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, analysts suggested that the coup was likely led by a faction and could ultimately fizzle, paving the way for Mr. Erdogan to further cement his grip power.  The coup attempt threw Turkey, a vital member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, into turmoil as Mr. Erdogan and his government allies tried to assure citizens that they were still in control. All three opposition parties in Turkey\u2019s parliament decried the coup attempt as undemocratic, as lawmakers were rushing to the national assembly. \u201cBeing faced with a new coup is not and will never be something that we can accept,\u201d said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main-opposition Republican People\u2019s Party."]
["Middle East News", "After midnight, scores of people took to the streets. Television footage showed some people cheering tanks as they drove past. Hundreds of people marched on a main highway to Istanbul\u2019s international airport, waving flags and chanting pro-Erdogan slogans.  Thousands heeding the president\u2019s call to fight the coup attempt also gathered at the historic clock tower in central Izmir, on the Aegean coast, and at the central Kizilay Square in Ankara, waving Turkish flags. In several Turkish cities, prayer calls were read repeatedly overnight from minarets, coupled with calls for people called to take the streets to support the government. \u201cThese calls are nonstop,\u201d said a resident in Polatli, a small town in central Turkey. \u201cThey are reading a statement calling for everyone to support the president and go to the streets tonight, and not sleep.\u201d \u201cBut everyone here is afraid to go out,\u201d he said. Some groups were seen chanting slogans on the streets of southern touristic destinations, including Marmaris. Financial markets with ties to Turkey fell sharply in late-day trade in New York on reports of the attempted coup. The Turkish lira plunged against the dollar and other emerging-market currencies followed.  The attempted coup posed an immediate challenge for the U.S. government, which uses Turkey\u2019s Incirlik Air Base as its main launchpad to carry out airstrikes against Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq. A successful coup could force the U.S. military to curtail its military operations in Turkey."]

["Politics and Policy", "According to Kathryn Dunn-Tenpas,  a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked White House turnover rates over three decades, the Trump administration\u2019s 34% turnover rate\u201421 of the 61 senior officials she has tracked have resigned, been fired or reassigned\u2014is much higher than that of any other administration in the last 40 years, which is as far back as Ms. Dunn-Tenpas\u2019s analysis goes. The presidency with the next-highest first-year turnover rate was Ronald Reagan\u2019s, with 17% of senior aides leaving the administration in 1981. \u201cNot only is the percentage double, the seniority of people leaving is extraordinarily high,\u201d said Ms. Dunn-Tenpas.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s unprecedented to me. The first year always seems to have some missteps on staffing, often because the skills that worked well running a campaign don\u2019t always align with what it takes to run a government.\u00a0In this case, it\u2019s a president with no experience in government and people around him who also had no experience,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s higher than normal, but it\u2019s still surprising it\u2019s this high.\u201d Many inside the administration credit chief of staff John Kelly, who succeeded Mr. Priebus in July, with bringing greater stability to the West Wing.Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Mr. Trump\u2019s first-year turnover rate is three times higher than both Barack Obama\u2019s 9% and Bill Clinton\u2019s 11%. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A senior administration official, speaking to reporters last week said the turnover shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as a series of hiring mistakes."]
["Politics and Policy", "\n \u201cIs it a mistake to have to fire people? You\u2019re asking, did he make a mistake in hiring them in the first place? You have to be more specific about people,\u201d the senior administration official responded. \u201cI know we love to learn the more generic points of palace intrigue than the finer points of policy sometimes, but we have a really good team here. And we have a team that is very well managed by the chief of staff.\u201d Many inside the administration credit chief of staff John Kelly, who succeeded Mr. Priebus in July, with bringing greater stability to the West Wing. The communications department, initially a main source of agitation for Mr. Trump, has also stabilized with adviser Hope Hicks, the fourth White House communications director to hold the position this year after Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s firing. Mr. Kelly\u2019s housecleaning continued with Mr. Bannon\u2019s ouster. Mr. Kelly\u2019s appointment as chief of staff left a vacancy at the Department of Homeland Security, which he was appointed to lead in January. His six-month tenure there is the shortest in the agency\u2019s history. He was succeeded by his deputy, Kirstjen Nielsen,  who was confirmed earlier this month. Still, the personnel churn \u201cis really destabilizing to the institution,\u201d Ms. Dunn-Tenpas said. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s turnover, they\u2019ve got to hire someone new and spend time training them. And when you pull someone from one important position to another, there\u2019s this domino effect.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci was fired as communications director after about a week on the job.Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press"]
["Politics and Policy", "As an antiestablishment outsider, Mr. Trump has continued to rely on a small circle of advisers\u2014as he did during his campaign\u2014placing a high priority on loyalty and leaving hundreds of other top jobs across the federal government vacant as part of his stated effort to reduce the size of government. During the transition, Mr. Trump mostly avoided hiring Republicans who had been critical of him or who worked for organizations opposing him during the campaign. Many experienced Washington hands who could have applied for positions stayed away. \u201cIt\u2019s hard getting beyond that inner circle because of his lack of trust with people he doesn\u2019t know,\u201d said one high-level GOP ally who worked on the presidential transition. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been the case that he makes snap decisions and winds up with people who are not great fits.\u201d Mr. Trump ignored multiple warnings not to hire Mr. Flynn as national security adviser from President Obama, his initial transition chief Gov. Chris Christie and others. Ultimately, Mr. Flynn\u2019s firing in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials and the eventual ouster of his deputy, K.T. McFarland,  prompted additional turnover on the National Security Council as H.R. McMaster took charge. Mr. Trump at times has filled vacancies by hiring from within his small group of trusted advisers. Mick Mulvaney,  executive director of the Office of Management and Budget, is currently overseeing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as interim director after its past director\u2019s resignation last month."]
["Politics and Policy", "Another factor in the fluid personnel situation is special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential campaign, which is likely to extend into 2018. The president has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and Moscow has denied inferring in the election; the U.S. intelligence community in January 2017 concluded that Russia had meddled in the campaign. If history is any guide, turnover will be even higher in the second year. According to Ms. Dunn-Tenpas\u2019s research, Mr. Reagan\u2019s turnover jumped from 17% in 1981 to 40% in 1982. Mr. Clinton lost 27% of his key advisers in year two and President George W. Bush,  who lost just 6% of senior aides in a first year, saw 27% of them leave the following year. Deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn both announced this month that they plan to depart early next year as the administration hits the one-year mark; Omarosa Manigault Newman,  an adviser to the president, also resigned effective Jan. 20, although the terms of her departure are less clear.  \u201cEvery chief executive has his or her own style, as does President Trump,\u201d said Jim Wolbarsht,  a Republican who has held appointed positions in five administrations and been a member of multiple federal advisory boards. \u201cHe seems to rely a lot less on existing institutions and structures than previous presidents.\u201d  Write to Eli Stokols at eli.stokols@wsj.com "]

["Middle East News", "The completion of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 drastically reduced the American footprint and its perceived influence in the region. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal, pushed by Mr. Obama over Riyadh\u2019s wishes, lifted international sanctions against Iran but hasn\u2019t met hopes of more-responsible behavior by Tehran\u2019s clerical rulers.  Conflicts in Syria and Yemen have raged on with little U.S. involvement, encouraging the use of proxy forces by Iran and its Gulf rivals. And a sharp reduction in U.S. foreign-oil consumption has added to disarray in energy markets. The White House is pinning its hopes for a more stable Middle East in years to come on the uncertain prospect that it can encourage a working relationship\u2014what Mr. Obama has called a \u201ccold peace\u201d\u2014between Saudi Arabia and Iran. He meets beginning Wednesday with leaders of Arab nations that make up the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. \u201cUltimately there is this conflict between the GCC and Iran, in particular between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and it has been a driver of some of the chaos and instability and the sectarianism that we have seen in the region,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cYou need a different kind of relationship between the Gulf countries and Iran\u2014one that\u2019s less prone to proxy conflicts\u2014and that\u2019s something that would be good for the region as a whole,\u201d the official said. \u201cPromoting that kind of dialogue is something the president will want to speak to the leaders about.\u201d"]
["Middle East News", "U.S. officials see political talks to resolve the conflicts in Syria and Yemen as possible vehicles for such a shift, which they said also could help moderate disagreements over energy policy and other issues. But the strategy requires at least some buy-in from highly skeptical Saudi leaders and other Persian Gulf states that will be meeting at a summit in Riyadh, even assuming Iran is willing to do its part. Thus, a key risk is that matters could get worse on both fronts if Iran remains intransigent and Saudi Arabia drifts away from the U.S. in disagreement over the approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the intent of the president is necessarily an intent that doesn\u2019t have some logic to it,\u201d said Dennis Ross, a longtime diplomat who\u2019s served in Republican and Democratic administrations, including Mr. Obama\u2019s. \u201cThe problem is at this point it\u2019s going to be very difficult for [the Saudis] to be responsive because they see the Iranians as a predator and they don\u2019t believe that he sees the threat as he needs to see it.\u201d Saudi Arabia, suspicious of Iran\u2019s ambitions and burgeoning relations with the U.S., has already made moves in an attempt to isolate Tehran. The Kingdom severed diplomatic ties with Iran in January after a mob ransacked its Tehran embassy and its consulate in the city of Mashhad in protest against Riyadh\u2019s execution of prominent Shiite cleric, Nemer al-Nemer."]
["Middle East News", "Riyadh also has moved to blunt the economic gains Iran stood to realize from the lifting of international sanctions\u2014required in last year\u2019s nuclear deal in return for dismantling its program\u2014by ramping up its oil production. In Iran, distrust of Saudi Arabia extends from the top of the country\u2019s political pyramid down to average Iranians. The discord was exacerbated last year after a stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca killed some 2,000 people, including more than 400 Iranians. Iran has repeatedly said it wants harmony in the region and blamed Saudi Arabia for stoking tensions. \u201cWe are not a threat against any country,\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said earlier this month, according to the official IRNA news agency. \u201cWe consider the security of other neighboring states and the region as our own security.\u201d An Iranian official at the country\u2019s United Nations mission didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment on Mr. Obama\u2019s objectives in Saudi Arabia and the mending of Saudi-Iranian ties. Saudi officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. A key problem for Mr. Obama as he tries to nudge the two countries toward a dialogue is the long-standing and deep mistrust between the U.S. and Iran, and growing doubts in Riyadh that Washington is a reliable ally. \u201cIf the administration hoped that the U.S. stepping back would lead our allies and adversaries to resolve their problems, that hope has been dashed,\u201d said Michael Singh, a managing director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf anything, the region has only grown more chaotic, and President Obama will leave his successor a proliferation of Middle East crises and no clear policy for navigating them.\u201d"]
["Middle East News", "White House officials have said Mr. Obama\u2019s Mideast policy has been designed to strengthen security and counterterrorism cooperation with the Gulf states while broadly advancing American interests, including by negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran and avoiding large-scale military invasions. \u201cThe region has seen quite a bit of instability in recent years, so they\u2019ve had to adjust to account for a lot of turmoil around them and to address what they see as very challenging regional environment,\u201d the senior Obama administration official said. \u201cI think we\u2019re very clear-eyed about the state of the relationships across the region, about some of the concerns that we have with Iran\u2019s behavior. But we\u2019ve also seen what\u2019s possible with dialogue and some effort to de-escalate, and we\u2019re going to continue to push that forward.\u201d The crux of the current friction between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia is their disagreement on an approach to Iran, which both see as a destabilizing force. Mr. Obama entered office in 2009 after campaigning on the idea of U.S. outreach to Iran, a shift from the George W. Bush administration policy and at odds with Riyadh\u2019s push for isolation. But Saudi Arabia was dismayed by a series of other U.S. moves that followed, including the White House\u2019s decision to encourage Egypt\u2019s President Hosni Mubarak to step down during 2011 Arab Spring protests, the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal and Mr. Obama\u2019s 11th-hour reversal on launching military strikes in Syria after the Assad regime crossed his \u201cred line\u201d by using chemical weapons."]
["Middle East News", "Saudi Arabia\u2019s anxieties deepened further as the oil glut created by U.S. production grew and sent prices plummeting in 2014. The nuclear deal, achieved in July 2015 by the U.S. and other world powers over Saudi Arabia\u2019s objections, freed Iran to expand oil production, often in direct competition with Saudi Arabia. Iran now aims to increase production by as much as 1 million barrels a day by year\u2019s end. That has made competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia a dominant theme of oil markets as petroleum states increasingly look for ways to restrain production. Saudi Arabia has so far refused to go along with any plan by producers to rein in production without Iran\u2019s agreeing to participate. Iran has flatly ruled that out. Riyadh\u2019s position prompted the collapse of talks among oil states last weekend. \u201cIran has made clear all along that it wasn\u2019t going to restrain production,\u201d said Jim Krane, a fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy. Saudi Arabia has used its position as the largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to keep Iran from profiting. Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Gulf allies have kept the oil taps wide open over the past year and a half, flooding the global market and keeping prices low. \u201cSaudi Arabia has supplied so much oil that oil is now cheaper than water,\u201d said Hassan Fadai,  an electrical engineer in Tehran. \u201cIt thinks it can harm the Islamic Republic in this way.\u201d"]
["Middle East News", "While officials in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia say the two still cooperate closely on security, particularly on counterterrorism, Riyadh has become more self-reliant. On one hand that is a success for Mr. Obama, who has sought to create an environment in which America\u2019s Middle East allies rely less on the U.S. White House officials have described this week\u2019s summit with Gulf states in Riyadh, which follows one last year in the U.S., as intended for the U.S. to help them enhance and integrate their military and security capabilities so they can be more self-reliant. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not the job of the president of the United States to solve every problem in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Obama said last year after securing the Iran nuclear deal. But fostering more independence among allies risks reduced U.S. leverage in the region. Saudi Arabia has adopted a more aggressive foreign policy and military posture that increasingly defies Washington. \u201cAlthough we do not like Obama\u2019s withdrawal policy, he did us a favor: He made us realize our own strengths,\u201d said Jamal Khashoggi,  a prominent Saudi columnist and political analyst. \u201cNow, Saudi Arabia takes initiative. We take matters in our own hands.\u201d Since Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran, it has pursued a with-us-or-against-us strategy in efforts to assemble a broad anti-Tehran bloc among its allies. A meeting last week of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, for instance, ended with a strongly-worded statement accusing Iran of supporting terrorism and interfering in Arab affairs."]
["Middle East News", "Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has blamed Saudi Arabia for the censure. \u201cConflicts between countries should be solved via bilateral diplomatic efforts and should not be on the agenda of a multilateral meeting,\u201d Mr. Zarif said, according to IRNA. Those who haven\u2019t joined Saudi Arabia in efforts to isolate Iran have found themselves isolated. Riyadh recently suspended $3 billion in pledged military aid to Lebanon, citing the rising influence of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed political and militant group. U.S. officials have warned Saudi Arabia that its hard-line stance risked driving Lebanon further into the hands of Iran. The challenges in the U.S.-Iran-Saudi dynamics have played out most prominently in Syria and Yemen. In Syria, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states wanted the U.S. to intervene early into the five-year conflict. They saw the conflict as an opportunity to topple Iran-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and pushed the U.S. to back opposition fighters. Mr. Obama resisted but drew his \u201cred line\u201d on Mr. Assad\u2019s using chemical weapons. When the Syrian regime did so in 2013, Mr. Obama prepared to take military action, then pulled back after Russia offered to negotiate a deal to remove chemical weapons from Syria. Mr. Obama has since launched a military campaign to fight Islamic State in Syria and Iraq but has left the future of Mr. Assad up to negotiations over a political transition in Syria. Disappointed, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have questioned whether they can rely on the U.S. after Mr. Obama softened his position that Mr. Assad must step down as part of any political agreement. Now the White House says he could stay in power as part of a transition."]
["Middle East News", "In March last year, Saudi Arabia began the military campaign against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels with the aim of restoring Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to the presidency. The Houthis practice an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and Riyadh and its Arab coalition allies see the group as a proxy of Iran. Saudi Arabia sees the fight as part of its broader confrontation with Iran for power and influence in the Middle East. Iran supports the Houthis politically but has denied supplying them weapons, despite several seizures of weapons caches by Western navies in recent months near the Yemeni coast. While the U.S. isn't part of the Saudi-led coalition, it supported the intervention and over time stepped-up its logistical and intelligence assistance to campaign. Saudi Arabia also has become more of a target within the U.S. Last week, two U.S. senators introduced legislation that would restrict the sales of air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia until it can demonstrate its commitment to combating terrorism and preventing civilian casualties. Riyadh also has come under renewed scrutiny for long-reputed ties between prominent Saudis and the Sept. 11 attack plotters, and U.S. lawmakers are pushing legislation to permit lawsuits against Saudi Arabia and other countries. The White House has threatened to veto that bill, if passed. \u2014Asa Fitch in Dubai and Bill Spindle in New York contributed to this article.  Write to Carol E.

Government lending to college and graduate students could soon become an immense drain on federal coffers, worsening an already deteriorating U.S. budget picture."]
["The Outlook", "The Education Department\u2019s inspector general, an agency watchdog, in a report released last week said the profitability of the U.S. federal student-lending program is being squeezed because millions of Americans who borrowed heavily in recent years\u2014including many graduate students\u2014are flocking into a program to have substantial portions of their debts forgiven.  Students who borrowed in the fiscal year ended Sep. 30, 2015, and enrolled in such \u201cincome-driven repayment\u201d plans, for example, are expected to pay back $11.5 billion less than they took to pay tuition and other schooling costs. The government still earns billions of dollars every year in interest on the loans it has made to 43 million American undergraduates, graduate students and parents of undergrads. But the losses from those not repaying are now projected to mount and could eat up all of the gains. It is hard to get precise estimates, but the Education Department\u2019s annual financial report, released in November, offered a clue. A footnote in the report projected that money coming in for government student loan and guarantee programs will be $36 billion short of what\u2019s needed to cover outstanding debt and accrued interest. A year earlier, the department projected the shortfall at $8.4 billion, while in prior years it projected the program would generate billions of dollars in taxpayer surpluses. The latest report explained that one reason for the sharp switch was the rise of income-driven repayment plans. These plans set monthly payments as a share of a borrower\u2019s income and then forgive any balance that remains after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the borrower\u2019s work status and loan size."]
["The Outlook", "While that $36 billion projection doesn\u2019t quite compare to the $4 trillion federal budget, it\u2019s still an immense sum. To put it in perspective, the government ultimately paid $33 billion in its response to the financial crisis through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The prospect of taxpayer losses on student loans increases the chances that Congress will make major changes to the program, such as eliminating debt-forgiveness options or placing new dollar limits on how much individuals can borrow. Congressional Republicans have proposed such changes. Moreover, the risk of a flood of red ink highlights what analysts across the political spectrum agree has become an inefficient system that for years directed funds to universities as they raised prices, with little regard for the creditworthiness of borrowers. The government expanded lending to help students pay for college, and it consistently estimated the program would return tens of billions of dollars in profits. Budget officials from the Education Department and Congress said that while taxpayers would end up covering a big chunk of unpaid loans\u2014including $108 billion in forgiven debt, according to a 2016 estimate by the Government Accountability Office\u2014enough borrowers would repay their debts with interest to maintain a surplus. Critics inside and outside the government have said faulty accounting methods overstated how much money the program would bring in. A GAO study in 2016 called for major changes to the government\u2019s methods, including its assumptions for future interest rates, how much debt it would collect on defaulted loans, and how many students would enroll in debt-forgiveness programs. The Education Department said its November estimate of $36 billion in prospective losses reflected internal accounting changes designed to respond to the GAO concerns."]
["The Outlook", "\u201cThere\u2019s been a systematic underestimate of default rates,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO chief who heads the conservative group American Action Forum. He said he believed costs would rise further given low student-repayment trends of recent years. \u201cThis is the financial downside of government-credit intervention, whether it\u2019s direct loans or guarantees. And it turns out these are large numbers.\u201d Nearly five million direct-loan borrowers have defaulted, meaning they\u2019ve gone at least a year without making payments. Other borrowers, particularly those with graduate degrees, are refinancing at lower interest rates through private lenders such as Social Finance Inc., reducing the money the government expected to make on interest payments. Others are getting their debt obligations waived by the Education Department because investigators concluded their schools defrauded them with deceptive recruiting. Perhaps the biggest factor is a surge in borrowers enrolling in income-driven repayment. The plans, created by Congress in the 1990s and 2000s, are designed to help the neediest, for example those in low-paying jobs. They\u2019re also helping borrowers who went to pricey, prestigious schools and now work in white-collar jobs. About 6.5 million Americans owing $352.5 billion in federal loans are enrolled in the programs, Education Department figures show. That is up from 1.6 million borrowers owing $72.3 billion in early 2013.  Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com "]

These costs consist mainly of the royalties it pays to the \u201cbig three\u201d rights holders, Universal Music, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music, as well as Merlin, a consortium of independent labels."]
["Heard on the Street", "Last year the gross margin improved as Spotify signed new licensing deals. It hit 24.5% in the fourth quarter, up from 17.5% in the comparable period of 2016, according to the company prospectus published last week. But improving it to a level more typical of the tech industry will be a slow grind. Licensing deals are negotiated every couple of years, so investors will have to wait for the next chance to strike a new bargain. Growing bigger should help Spotify cut incrementally better deals, but won\u2019t resolve the basic problem that ownership of must-have content is concentrated in so few hands. The big three plus Merlin accounted for 87% of songs streamed on Spotify last year. Video-streaming giant\n            Netflix\n            \n      \u2014whose longtime Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy is now in the same role at Spotify\u2014ran into something like this problem in 2011, notes Wesley Lebeau,  a fund manager for CPR Asset Management. Faced with escalating content costs, it bet big on exclusive productions, starting with \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d The gamble paid off so well that production houses are now scrambling to consolidate their bargaining power; hence the battle between Disney and Comcast for bits of\n        21st Century Fox\n.\n      Netflix had a 34% gross margin last year."]
["Heard on the Street", "But music is different: Apart from the concentration of rights ownership, new albums don\u2019t have the same marketing pull as a new TV series. Spotify\u2019s prospectus argues that \u201cpersonalization, not exclusivity, is key to our continued success.\u201d Competing with the record labels to get a better deal just doesn\u2019t seem a viable option. Spotify could boost gross margins by increasing prices. But unlike Netflix, which raised the cost of its key U.S. streaming package before Christmas, Spotify\u2019s monthly subscriptions fell to \u20ac5.32 ($6.55) last year, from \u20ac6.84 in 2015. This is partly because Spotify, in a bid to compete with rival Apple Music, rolled out \u201cfamily plans\u201d that give six household members access for only 50% more than the price of an individual subscription. But it could also reflect the different relationship consumers have with music, which they otherwise listen to free on the radio or Alphabet\u2019s YouTube. Netflix is much cheaper than a cable package; Spotify benefits from no such direct comparison. Private share transactions in February valued Spotify\u2019s equity at $19.7 billion, roughly 19 times last year\u2019s gross profits. The equivalent multiple for Netflix is 32 times. If investors want Spotify to be the Netflix for music, with a valuation to match, it needs to demonstrate more pricing power, both with consumers and the music industry. For all the growth on show in its prospectus, Spotify still looks like a company that will only ever make as much money as the big record labels let it."]

["Markets Main", "China in recent weeks has banned exchanges that trade bitcoin, fearing the virtual currency could provide an avenue for capital flight.\u00a0J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon,  whose bank is the largest dealer in global currencies, last month called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d and said he would fire any employee who traded it. Yet Japan\u2019s government has embraced bitcoin, creating regulations to legitimize its trading. India and Sweden have mused about creating their own virtual currencies, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has studied bitcoin and the technology underpinning it. Bitcoin pioneered the cryptocurrency movement, but after eight years, the virtual currency is still struggling to find mainstream acceptance.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that runs on a decentralized network of computers, rather than a centralized ledger under the control of a central bank or government. Users can exchange value directly, without a middleman such as a bank.  Big banks, including J.P. Morgan and Goldman, have dabbled in the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain, and opined on its potential to reshape industries. But they have been wary of venturing directly into a market whose early enthusiasts included anarchists and drug dealers."]
["Markets Main", "Bitcoin has been a popular tool of ransomware, like the 2017 WannaCry cyberattack. It was also used extensively on darkweb marketplaces like the Silk Road, which trafficked in illegal drugs. It has also been beset by frauds and Ponzi schemes and its anonymity complicates governments trying to track the people behind transactions. As digital coins proliferate and draw interest from professional investors, though, they become harder for Wall Street trading desks to ignore. Bitcoin\u2019s price has soared this year, from $969 to more than $5,000 last month before pulling back. Ethereum, a rival, traded as high as $400 after ending 2016 at $8. In all, nearly $150 billion of digital currencies are in circulation. Goldman\u00a0seeks to serve a growing cadre of institutional investors wagering on bitcoin. Its\u00a0effort could\u00a0eventually entail a team of traders and salespeople making markets in bitcoins much as they do Japanese yen or\n            Apple\n Inc.\n      shares. Keeping abreast of the day-to-day cryptocurrency market could also position Goldman to capitalize on further development of this market. Digital-currency proponents envision a world where coins will be widely accepted by online retailers and companies will use the tokens for cross-border commerce. Already, cryptocurrencies are infringing on some traditional banking activities. Some startup companies that historically might have hired banks to take them public are bypassing Wall Street by selling digital tokens, rather than shares, to the public. Such \u201cinitial coin offerings\u201d raised $1.3 billion over the past three months without paying fees to underwriting banks."]
["Markets Main", "Goldman\u2019s effort involves both its\u00a0currency-trading division and the bank\u2019s strategic investment group, the people said.\u00a0That suggests the firm believes bitcoin\u2019s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold. Launched in 2009, bitcoin grew as a communal software project championed by cypherpunks, who embraced its technological promise, and libertarians, who cheered its independence from government influence.\u00a0In recent years, more sophisticated exchanges have cropped up to host trading, attracting professional investors. Some 70 hedge funds now invest in cryptocurrencies, according to research firm Autonomous NEXT. Exchange-traded funds meant to track digital currencies have so far faced pushback from regulators, but\u00a0they could\u00a0one day\u00a0give a wider base of investors a way to indirectly own bitcoin and create new opportunities for savvy traders. Such interest from institutional investors has propelled the bitcoin market to a size that merits banks\u2019 attention. About $750 million of bitcoin trades on exchanges every day, on par with the daily trading volume of shares of\n            Caterpillar\n Inc.,\n      the equipment maker. Already, a handful of nonbank finance firms, such as DRW Holdings LLC\u2019s Cumberland Mining\u00a0and Genesis Global Trading Inc., broker bitcoin trades for institutional investors that want to buy or sell larger amounts than exchanges could handle. That is a role that banks could easily step into. Wall Street firms also offer leverage to juice trading returns and hold assets on clients\u2019 behalf.\u00a0So far, though, none of the big banks have dealt directly in bitcoin."]
["Markets Main", "For starters, bitcoin is highly volatile. After doubling in price between July and early September, bitcoin lost 35% of its value\u00a0in two weeks. That exposes dealers to the risk of big, quick losses. But it also offers an opportunity for quick-footed traders to profit by anticipating price moves and facilitating panicked trading. Volatility has been sorely missing lately in traditional markets, leading to a slump in banks\u2019 trading revenue. Goldman, once known as the nimblest trader on Wall Street, has struggled more than peers. Revenue in its fixed-income division fell 21% from last year through June, dragged down by poor performance in commodities and currencies. Already, some of the infrastructure for trading bitcoin is cropping up. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission this summer approved the first derivatives exchange for cryptocurrencies. LedgerX, founded by two former Goldman traders, will clear options and futures that would allow dealers to protect themselves from drastic price swings and lock in profits. Many prominent financiers, including Mr. Dimon, believe central banks such as the Federal Reserve will move to shut down digital currencies before they go mainstream enough to rival government-backed notes. \nMorgan Stanley \n            \n      Chief Executive James Gorman recently took a nuanced view.

Sales at retail stores and restaurants slid 0.3% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $446.89 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Sales have fallen or been flat for each of the opening three months of the year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected March sales would be unchanged from the prior month. Overall, the numbers suggest the economy is still growing but consumers have, at least temporarily, lost some momentum since mid-2015. "]
["Economic Data", "\u201cConsumer spending has been the main engine of growth in the U.S. for the past few years,\u201d said Dana Saporta, director of U.S. economics research at Credit Suisse.\u201dThis was probably still the case in [the first quarter], but that engine appears to have run slower than it did\u201d in the fourth quarter. Retail sales for February were revised to a flat reading, compared with the initially reported 0.1% decline. Sales fell 0.4% in January. Compared with a year earlier, March sales grew 1.7%. One big reason for March\u2019s weak overall reading was a drop in auto sales, one driver of spending last year. Spending on vehicles and parts tumbled 2.1% in March.  The Commerce Department report reflects the dollar value of sales. Separate sales data out earlier this month showed March sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.5 million light vehicles, a disappointing figure following a record 17.5 million in 2015. Excluding motor vehicles, March retail sales were up 0.2% from the prior month. Excluding gasoline, sales were down 0.4%. Excluding both categories, sales advanced 0.1% last month.  Retail sales are a key barometer for overall consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic output in the U.S. American households have benefited from relatively cheaper gasoline and an improving labor market for more than a year. But wages have been growing only slowly, other measures of the economy have been mixed, and financial markets have been volatile in the opening months of 2016."]
["Economic Data", "That has led to tepid spending on goods and services alongside higher saving rates. For the entire first quarter, retail sales are 0.1% lower than the final three months of 2015. Wednesday\u2019s report showed that Americans spent more last month at gasoline stations, likely a reflection of an uptick in fuel prices since February. Sales also climbed at building suppliers, and health and personal-care stores. Americans cut back at restaurants and bars, clothing stores and department stores. Despite a so-so first quarter for consumers, some economists expect overall spending to pick up in coming months. Since the end of 2015, the labor market has added 628,000 jobs and average hourly earnings are up 0.7%. \u201cWith employment gains still healthy and real incomes growing at a solid pace, we expect real consumption growth to rebound further over the first half of the year,\u201d said Steve Murphy, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The Federal Reserve closely eyes consumer-spending data as a gauge of economic growth, and Fed officials pointed to solid outlays as a factor in their decision to raise interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. But central bank officials have since decided to stand pat while the economy faces headwinds from overseas. Underscoring weakness abroad, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday again cut its forecast for global growth prospects. The retail-sales data are adjusted for seasonal variations but not for price changes. The report doesn\u2019t include estimates for most services, which make up the bulk of consumer spending."]

["Commodities", "The Congolese Senate passed late Wednesday the new mining code unanimously with the support of President Joseph Kabila,  who is expected to sign it into law. Over the past three years, Congo has struggled to raise enough revenues to pay public workers and fund social projects, fueling discontent across the impoverished nation, roughly the size of Western Europe. A Congolese government spokesman said the new taxes\u2014which also raise levies on copper and nickel\u2014would give the country\u2019s 80 million people \u201c a fair share\u201d of its natural resources. Mining-industry groups lobbied against the law unsuccessfully and decried its potential impact on Thursday. The new taxes would hit cobalt producers like Swiss commodities giant\n            Glencore\n            \n      PLC and potentially make the metal more expensive for automakers and technology companies trying to lockdown supplies. \u201cThis revised mine code will hurt investments in a significant way,\u201d said John Nkono,  the secretary-general of the mine industry group Chamber of Mines, in an interview. \u201cGovernment has ignored our advice on almost every aspect including on royalties and tax rates\u2026it is total chaos.\u201d Glencore declined to comment. The company pointed to a statement in December signed by a Congolese subsidiary that said the country\u2019s mining-reform plan would \u201chave a major negative impact on ongoing mining projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u201d"]
["Commodities", "Congo first attempted to revise the 2002 mining code three years ago before suddenly withdrawing it following a slump in global metal prices, amid fierce objection from miners. In May last year, the government reintroduced the bill, saying that despite strong growth registered by the mining sector, it continues to lag behind in terms of revenue contributions to government.

["Technology", "Both the Twitter and Facebook moves may fail to address many users\u2019 concerns. They show technology companies that have grown into powerful media voices struggling to find a balance between being havens for misinformation and censors of free speech. Concerns about false news stories on Facebook intensified during the recent presidential election campaign after erroneous claims were shared widely on the network, such as reports that Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump and that the Clinton Foundation bought $137 million in illegal arms. Some critics say the social-media sites should do more to promote accuracy and civil discourse. But the companies are wary of prescribing what their users should read or how they should act. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post on Saturday played down the impact of fake news, while also saying that his company is developing tools to curb it, including one that would allow users to flag news that they believe is fake. But Syracuse University communications professor Jennifer Grygiel, who studies social media, said relying on users is inadequate. Instead, she said Facebook should hire more workers to review widely shared articles and remove those that are false. \u201cWhat he needs to do is hire more humans instead of pushing (the responsibility) onto the end user,\u201d Ms. Grygiel said. \u201cKnow how much the community is trained in identifying fake news? Zilch.\u201d In his Saturday post, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook won\u2019t try to separate fact from fiction, because defining the truth is complicated. \u201cWe must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,\u201d he wrote."]
["Technology", "Karen North, director of the social-media program at the University of Southern California, agreed. \u201cDo you really want Facebook and Twitter deciding what you can talk about?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope and these companies already have massive control over what we see and what we don\u2019t.\u201d Facebook has strained to appear objective, particularly after reports in May that certain politically motivated workers prevented conservative news from appearing in its \u201ctrending topics\u201d feature. Executives have been uneasy about taking steps that suggest Facebook is restricting free speech, current and former employees say. That has stirred dissent within the company, with some employees urging Facebook to do more to weed out misinformation, according to two people familiar with the matter. They said the topic was discussed during an all-hands meeting Thursday with the 32-year-old CEO. Google parent\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\n      had largely avoided the controversy around internet propaganda, because it doesn't operate a thriving social network and because its search engine rewards websites that are linked to by established sites. Still, the company was pulled into the debate on Sunday when a post from a little-known right-wing blog erroneously stating that Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the popular vote appeared atop the Google search results for several election-related queries. Mrs. Clinton is leading by almost 700,000 votes in the Journal\u2019s tabulation. \u201cIn this case we clearly didn\u2019t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said in an email."]
["Technology", "On Monday, shortly before Facebook\u2019s similar announcement, Google said it would ban fake-news websites from using its ad-selling system, likely hurting those sites\u2019 revenue. Google\u2019s AdSense program, which helps website operators sell ads on their sites, is the most popular way to monetize websites and has helped fund many propaganda sites. Google pulled AdSense from several sites on Monday. Twitter, meanwhile, has long grappled with complaints that some users repeatedly post abusive and harassing messages. The moves announced Tuesday include a feature that lets users block notifications of tweets that include specific words or phrases. Users will still see such tweets on Twitter\u2019s website and app. When flagging problem tweets, users will be able to note that the messages include hate speech or \u201ctargeted harassment.\u201d Users can also now block specific conversations between other users that include them. Del Harvey, Twitter\u2019s vice president of trust and safety, acknowledged the steps are \u201cnot going to solve the problem of abuse on Twitter.\u201d Ms. North, the USC professor, said the burden to report abuse falls largely on the victim. \u201cWhile they keep making these small steps\u2026there\u2019s still no major consequences for abusing anyone on Twitter,\u201d she said.

["Markets Main", "Mr. Stumpf won\u2019t receive a severance package, the bank said. The board, at Mr. Stumpf\u2019s own recommendation, had previously decided he should relinquish $41 million in unvested equity, one of the biggest-ever forfeitures of pay by a bank chief. He still retires with tens of millions of dollars earned during roughly 35 years at the bank.  Wells Fargo, in the face of a sales scandal and federal investigations, replaced embattled CEO John Stumpf with longtime employee Timothy Sloan. WSJ's Aaron Lucchetti joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero and explains whether the move will be enough to regain the public's trust and appease lawmakers. Photo: AP Mr. Stumpf\u2019s departure comes after he was subjected to two grillings on Capitol Hill in which he was attacked by both Democrats and Republicans. The bank also faces numerous federal and state inquiries into its sales-practices issues, including from the Justice Department. The toppling of Mr. Stumpf, 63 years old and just shy of his 10th year as CEO, marks a stunning comedown for a firm that largely passed through the financial crisis unscathed and which was seen as a reliable Main Street lender. That reputation was shattered by the sales-tactics scandal, which revealed that bank employees had opened as many as two million accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge. The bank has said it regrets the improper behavior, has ended sales goals for retail-bank employees and has been refunding customers improperly charged."]
["Markets Main", "The problems came to light Sept. 8 when Wells Fargo agreed to a $185 milion fine and enforcement action with regulators. That settlement also brought to light that the bank had fired 5,300 employees over a five-year period for improper behavior. This underscored the breadth of problems related to a hard-charging sales culture that pushed bankers to sell multiple products to individual customers. While Mr. Sloan takes over as CEO, the bank\u2019s lead independent director, Stephen Sanger,  will become chairman, the bank said. Elizabeth Duke,  a current director and former Federal Reserve governor, will become vice chairman. Mr. Stumpf officially told the board of his decision to retire in a half-page letter Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the letter, Mr. Stumpf said he wouldn\u2019t sell any of the shares he already owns before the end of the board\u2019s independent investigation, this person said, adding that those shares could also be clawed back depending on the results of that investigation.  Mr. Stumpf will walk away with total compensation during his years at Wells Fargo valued at about $120 million, according to an estimate by Mark Reilly,  a managing director at human-resources consultancy Overture Group LLC. This estimate reflects the value of stock and stock options as well as retirement benefits and deducts the $41 million Mr. Stumpf has already forfeited. It is based on the bank\u2019s Wednesday share price.  Wells Fargo is facing a $185 million fine following widespread illegal sales practices. WSJ\u2019s Emily Glazer joins Lunch Break to discuss.

["Markets Main", "However, the board could decide, depending on the investigation\u2019s outcome, that Mr. Stumpf should relinquish more pay, the person added. This could include as much as $24 million of pension benefits, the person said. The board didn\u2019t try to persuade Mr. Stumpf to stay, the person familiar with the situation said. It hosted a board meeting via telephone in the early afternoon Wednesday to vote officially on next steps. It made sense for Mr. Sanger, the board\u2019s lead independent director and a former chairman and CEO of\n            General Mills\n Inc.,\n      to take over as nonexecutive chairman, this person said. The board decided a split of the chairman and chief executive role could make sense given the corporate-governance pressure in all industries to do so. This will make Wells Fargo only the second big U.S. bank, along with\n            Citigroup\n Inc.,\n      to split the two roles. It will also return Wells Fargo to the arrangement in place when Mr. Stumpf first became CEO. At that time, his predecessor, Richard Kovacevich,  remained as chairman. Known for his affable demeanor, Mr. Stumpf in his early years as CEO often allowed the outspoken Mr. Kovacevich to grab the spotlight. When Wells Fargo decided to acquire Wachovia Corp. during the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, it retained Mr. Kovacevich as chairman to play a key role in combining the two large retail banks. Mr. Stumpf succeeded Mr. Kovacevich as chairman at the end of 2009."]

["Middle East Crossroads", "Asked in an interview to state Israel\u2019s main objective in Syria, Dore Gold, the director-general of the foreign ministry, said: \u201cAt the end of the day, when some kind of modus vivendi is reached inside of Syria, it is critical from the Israeli standpoint that Syria does not emerge as an Iranian satellite incorporated fully into the Iranian strategic system.\u201d For the U.S. and other Western nations, by contrast, the main priority in Syria is to destroy Islamic State and other Sunni radical movements that are perhaps even more opposed to Iran\u2019s rival Shiite theocracy than they are to the West.

As many Israeli officials see it, however, that wouldn\u2019t be such a good scenario if it ends up benefiting the Syrian military and its critical Lebanese ally, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, which remains sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction. \u201cIf we have to choose between ISIS and Assad, we\u2019ll take ISIS. ISIS has flatbed trucks and machine guns. Assad represents the strategic arch from Tehran to Beirut, 130,000 rockets in the hands of Hezbollah, and the Iranian nuclear program,\u201d said Michael Oren, a prominent lawmaker from Israel\u2019s governing coalition and a former ambassador to Washington."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\n One Israeli official joked that his talking points on the regional confrontation have become virtually identical to those of his Sunni Arab counterparts. This alignment spurred some unusual exchanges this month in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies labeled Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Lawmakers from Israel\u2019s Arab parties condemned the Gulf countries\u2019 decision as an \u201cact of loyalty to neocolonialist and Zionist forces.\u201d In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,  who also serves as foreign minister, decried as \u201ccrazy\u201d the criticism of the Saudi kingdom, which under Israeli law technically remains an enemy state. Israel\u2019s immediate concerns are to prevent Hezbollah from opening a second front from Syrian soil opposite the Israeli-held Golan Heights, and to prevent transfers of sophisticated Iranian weapons to the Lebanese militia.  Israel\u2019s President Reuven Rivlin discussed these concerns with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, Israeli media reported. While Russia has deployed its military to assist Mr. Assad\u2019s regime, it didn\u2019t interfere with recent Israeli airstrikes against suspected Hezbollah weapons convoys and depots inside Syria. Currently, most of Syria around the Golan Heights is controlled by rebel groups, including Nusra Front. Israel has acknowledged providing medical help to Syrians injured near the demarcation line, including rebel fighters. But it has stopped short of openly training, arming or funding Syrian proxies.  Not everyone in Israel\u2019s foreign-policy and security establishment is confident that such a focus on Iran and Hezbollah\u2014while turning a relatively blind eye to Islamic State and al Qaeda\u2014constitutes a wise policy in the long run."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cIsrael\u2019s interests in Syria narrow down to one thing: calm borders as it used to be.

Several openly credit the tax breaks for their interest. \u201cWe have increased credits because there\u2019s been increased investments\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what the state wanted,\u201d said Kara Moriarty, leader of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association. Smaller subsidies would likely lead to smaller investments from oil companies, industry officials said. That could create a conundrum for the state. Unlike other states, Alaska owns its oil reserves, entitling it to royalties on production. That likely totaled $947 million in the last year, more than half the state\u2019s oil income, according to state estimates. Even if it cuts back subsidies and increases oil tax revenue, it could lose money in the long run if that discourages drillers from tapping Alaska\u2019s reserves. The state may have to take that risk to fix its immediate problems, said Gunnar Knapp, an economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage. \u201cIn the short term\u2026we\u2019re scrambling for cash,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a major fiscal crisis.\u201d"]
["Markets Main", "Because Alaska is so reliant on oil money, its income has fallen in concert with global oil prices that are down 57% from last year\u2019s highs. State officials hadn\u2019t anticipated that decline. They had to cut funding for schools, police and roads, cap health-care spending and dip into savings to close a deficit of more than $3 billion. Mr. Walker\u2019s administration is rolling out long-term changes, too, which include the push for lower subsidies and changes to the dividend. The oil industry has become a target in part because some of the world\u2019s biggest companies benefit from the subsidies. The companies and state officials declined to detail how much each recipient gets. But many across Alaska roughly know the biggest beneficiaries because subsidies are often based on production and spending. The state\u2019s largest oil tax break in 2014, $492 million, was divided based on production in the North Slope. That likely makes ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and BP the biggest recipients because they controlled about 85% of the region\u2019s production that year, experts said. Representatives at ConocoPhillips and BP said their companies no longer qualify for these subsidies because of limits in place for when oil prices fall. All three companies referred interview requests to industry groups."]
["Markets Main", "Wall Street lenders also have benefited. Debt investors like\n            Apollo Global Management\n            \n      LLC and banks like\n            Bank of America\n Corp.\n      have made short-term loans to cash-hungry oil companies using the tax breaks as a guarantee. Oil companies have been so eager for loans, their lenders have been able to get returns as high as 20%. But the returns can often be much smaller, and deals are sometimes as small as a few million dollars. Australia\u2019s Linc was one of the companies that used this type of loan, working with Apollo. It sold the rights to $29.5 million in state rebates it was eligible for in 2013, giving up a 15% cut to Apollo, according to an investor prospectus from last year. Apollo lent Linc $50 million total over two years, with Apollo\u2019s returns in the \u201clow teens,\u201d said Jude Rolfes,  Linc\u2019s vice president for corporate development.  Linc\u2019s oil reserves are in a spot largely ignored for 30 years. Linc had to build an 80-mile ice road, ship its rig over it on two-ton trucks, drill in subzero temperatures and round-the-clock darkness and haul everything away within four months before the spring thaw. \u201cThis is almost like found money for producers up there,\u201d said Mr. Rolfes. \u201cIt\u2019s why people are going to Alaska.\u201d"]

Thousands of its troops play a leading role in managing regional conflicts, while close ties to China, the Gulf states and the U.S. make it a power broker in a region marred by turmoil and poverty. Still, its ascent has come with a strict control of the economy and, critics say, even-stricter control over dissent and human rights. The 51-year-old leader, who took power after the death of\u00a0Meles Zenawi in 2012, said his government wanted to bolster cooperation with Washington against jihadist groups and instability in the Horn of Africa, where it has deployed thousands of troops in war-torn nations including Somalia and South Sudan. But he\u00a0also cautioned the new president against abandoning the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA, a 17-year-old deal renewed by President Barack Obama in 2015 to boost U.S. trade with 40 African nations and offset China\u2019s growing economic dominance there."]
["Africa News", "\u201cI hope AGOA provisions will continue for the coming 10 years,\u201d Mr. Desalegn said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d message followed Beijing\u2019s model. Mr.\u00a0Desalegn\u2014who heads the country\u2019s ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolution Democratic front and its 36-member committee that makes key policy decisions\u2014said he hoped to work with Mr. Trump to deepen collaboration against jihadist terror. But the prime minister, who imposed a state of emergency in November to quell violent antigovernment protests, also rejected Western calls to open strategic sectors of Ethiopia\u2019s economy and criticism of his government\u2019s human-rights record. \u201cWe have never been colonized because of our attitude.\u2026We have the confidence, the moral authority and our people are also enough to tell us what they want to tell us,\u201d Mr. Desalegn said. A decade of rapid economic growth has underpinned the confidence of this nation of 100 million. The International Monetary Fund says Ethiopia\u2019s economy posted double-digit expansion for the three years to 2016, when it slowed to 6.5%, following the region\u2019s worst drought in 50 years and swelling domestic dissent. The IMF warned in October that Ethiopia\u2019s debt load was becoming dangerous. Mr. Desalegn deployed security forces to quell protests from marginalized tribes, sparking clashes that left hundreds dead and thousands incarcerated. A strict ban on social media remains in effect. The crisis drew international attention when marathon runner Feyisa Lilesa used his second-place finish at the Rio Olympics to protest the crackdown on his Oromo tribe, and then defected to the U.S."]
["Africa News", "New York-based Human Rights Watch says the state of emergency is an extension of Ethiopia\u2019s \u201cbrutal repression of freedoms,\u201d but Mr. Desalegn said it is a \u201cprocedural matter\u201d that would soon be lifted. \u201cThe state of emergency doesn\u2019t hinder anything or anyone to invest, to work, to come as a tourist.\u201d To be sure, state control of the economy and domestic dissent hasn\u2019t quelled investor appetite for Ethiopian assets. More than 200 state-owned businesses have been privatized since the late 1990s, with international heavyweights like \nKKR\n            \n      & Co. investing in horticulture, and Turkish, Chinese and U.S. companies creating thousands of jobs in textiles and shoe manufacturing.

["The Middle Seat", "Pittsburgh ticket prices will be cheaper to Europe than to California, too. For a July 13-20 trip from Pittsburgh, WOW offers $320 coach tickets to Reykjav\u00edk. (Like many discount airlines, fees will hit hard: A carry-on bag is $40 extra. Advance seat assignment in the back is $9.) Compare that to the United Airlines nonstop to San Francisco on the same dates for $579. \u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market this summer,\u201d says Christina Cassotis,  the airport\u2019s chief executive. This trans-Atlantic push is happening because new discount airlines are taking advantage of new freedom from restrictive treaties in international travel and new small- and medium-size airplanes that can make long trips at low costs. Their strategy: Copy some of the\n            Southwest Airlines\n            \n      blueprint and fly to secondary cities, creating demand with low fares. Some of the flights are downright mind-bending: Stewart Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., averages just seven flights a day to five U.S. cities. But come summer it will have nonstop\n            Norwegian Air Shuttle\n            \n      flights to five airports in Europe, including Bergen, Norway, gateway to the fiords. Providence, R.I., will get a similar Norwegian schedule."]
["The Middle Seat", "Norwegian started selling tickets with $65 one-way fares including taxes. Those have long since sold out. But the prices available this week for July trips are still startling\u2014roughly half what big airlines offer for summer trips to Europe. A July 13-21 trip from Stewart, 60 miles north of New York City, to Bergen was priced at $390 round-trip including taxes. Norwegian is using the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to offer discounted fares across the Atlantic. The new fuel-efficient plane costs less to operate than larger and older widebody jets, enabling Norwegian to undercut rivals on price.Photo: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News \u201cIt\u2019s been way too expensive to fly across the Atlantic, way too expensive,\u201d says Bjorn Kjos,  founder and CEO of Norwegian Air Shuttle. \u201cIf airlines can lower the cost they will ramp up the volume.\u201d Other new flights present new opportunities to reach even the major European cities without the traditional routes of going to big hubs on big planes. Edelweiss, the leisure subsidiary of Swiss International, will fly twice a week between Zurich and San Diego starting in June. Norwegian will start flights in June from Barcelona to Los Angeles, Newark, N.J., Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Oakland, Calif. It will fly more this summer between London and both Los Angeles and Oakland, as well as its Paris flights to New York and L.A.

["The Middle Seat", "In all, consultant Craig Jenks counts a net 30 new trans-Atlantic flights this summer, mostly on European airlines. Last summer saw 24 new flights, many of which are continuing. \u201cI think you can probably make a case that some of this is not going to last. But why not take it while it\u2019s on offer?\u201d says Mr. Jenks, president of Airline/Aircraft Projects in New York. To find the new flights, pay attention to billboards: The airports with new service usually pay to market the new service. Book direct or use a broad search engine like Kayak, Google Flights, Skyscanner or Momondo that will pick up discount airlines that may not list flights in central travel agency computers. Be flexible with your dates. Some of these new flights won\u2019t run daily.  Airlines say many of their new flights are seeing more bookings from the U.S. side than from Europe. And European inbound travel to the U.S. could take a hit from possible new Trump administration rules on \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of visitors. So far, airlines say summer bookings are strong.  WOW will be flying to eight U.S. cities this summer: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.Photo: Larry MacDougal/Associated Press Bigger European rivals are taking the discount invasion seriously, creating their own low-cost subsidiaries to try to fight back.

["The Middle Seat", "Just like the original discounters, long-haul startups say small airports have lower costs, and many offer incentives such as dollars to market new service in the U.S. and Europe.  Norwegian says one key to its strategy is new, fuel-efficient airplanes that have the range to make long trips.

It will have 189 seats, making for tight quarters on long trips.  Some of Norwegian\u2019s new routes are already attracting a competitive response, opening up a plethora of seats for travelers. The cheapest way to London this summer could be going through smaller cities like New Orleans, Fort Lauderdale or Oakland. \nBritish Airways\n            \n      is launching flights from London to all three cities, longtime favorites of Southwest, four times a week.

["Financial Regulation", "Mr. Clark\u2019s pilgrimage, which he says he makes twice a year from Truliant Federal Credit Union in Winston-Salem, N.C., is one brick in a fortress that credit unions have been building for decades around their tax-exempt status. The industry recorded $9.6 billion in net income last year that wasn\u2019t subject to corporate income tax. That has made it a thorn in the side of banks, which must pay the tax and have for years been lobbying to kill the exemption by arguing it gives credit unions an unfair advantage. But credit unions have kept themselves off the chopping block as lawmakers scurried to find tax breaks to eliminate to help fund an overhaul of the tax code, making it a case study on why the tax code is so hard to rewrite. The first U.S. credit union opened in 1909 to help New Hampshire millworkers pool their savings and lend to one another. Congress liked the idea of nonprofit lenders and gave credit unions federal tax benefits in 1937. Credit unions don\u2019t have to pay federal income tax, so long as they serve a defined group of members and use profits to provide more services\u2014as opposed to banks, which can serve any customer and distribute profits to shareholders but do pay income tax. Bankers say this quid pro quo has grown meaningless over time. Congress and the National Credit Union Administration, the industry\u2019s regulator, have gradually relaxed limits on credit unions\u2019 activities. Though the industry is still smaller than the banking sector, it has grown: 282 credit unions had more than $1 billion in assets at the end of the second quarter."]
["Financial Regulation", "Bankers also say credit unions are using their resources for purposes that don\u2019t justify the costs to the Treasury, such as lobbying. Another example: The Sacramento Kings\u2019 basketball arena is named for Golden1 Credit Union, California\u2019s largest, in a deal that reportedly cost $120 million over 20 years. An NCUA spokesman said the agency hasn\u2019t relaxed limits, it has \u201cworked to modernize regulation to respond to the changes occurring in the financial industry\u201d and done so within the law. Credit unions, for their part, say they are complying with legal limits set by Congress while their members enjoy the benefit of lower-cost financial services.  \u201cWhat we do is invest in our members and we invest in our members\u2019 communities,\u201c said Golden1 Chief Executive Donna Bland in an interview. She said that the arena sponsorship makes the credit union stronger by building its brand, and Golden1 members benefit both from the investment in the local economy and from perks such as discounted tickets. Bankers have organized their own lobbying this year to kill the exemption. The problem for bankers: When they take up a political fight with credit unions, they often lose. Credit unions\u2019 secret weapon is their ability to tap not only credit-union executives but also their roughly 110 million members, part of what boosters call the \u201ccredit-union movement.\u201d In 1984, the Reagan administration proposed eliminating the tax exemption for credit unions. The idea wasn\u2019t expected to generate much revenue compared with other policy changes, but it did come with significant political blowback, recalled Tom Neubig,  a Treasury Department official at that time."]
["Financial Regulation", "Lawmakers dropped the proposal. \u201cA lot of this is, \u2018Who squawks loudest?\u2019 They are more likely to dodge the bullet,\u201d Mr. Neubig said. In the 1990s, bankers sued to limit credit unions\u2019 expanding field of membership. They briefly celebrated a 1998 Supreme Court ruling that credit unions had expanded beyond legal limits. Less than a year later, after thousands of credit-union members rallied in Washington and droves more called or wrote their congressmen with the message \u201cI want to stay in my credit union,\u201d lawmakers passed a bill essentially negating the Supreme Court decision, though the bill did limit credit unions\u2019 business-lending activities. When Dennis Ross,  a Florida Republican congressman, proposed taking away the tax-exempt status of credit unions in 2012 as part of a broader deficit-reduction bill, he faced immediate blowback. All of a sudden the freshman Congressman \u201cfelt very popular,\u201d he said in an interview. Dan Berger, now president of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, recalled phoning Mr. Ross\u2019s office within minutes. \u201cHey, we are coming to see you,\u201d he said. Credit-union representatives showed up soon after, arguing the bill would hurt members and could force credit unions to close. Mr. Ross within hours withdrew his proposal, saying it had been a mistake. Had Mr. Ross gone further, he might have encountered \u201cProject ZIP Code,\u201d a tool created by the Credit Union National Association, another trade group. It identifies credit-union members by their home address and matches the data with congressional districts to target lawmakers it sees as a threat."]
["Financial Regulation", "When Republicans started laying the groundwork for the rewrite of the tax code in 2014, Project ZIP Code was triggered to help credit-union members write their congressmen or post on social media: \u201cDon\u2019t tax my credit union.\u201d The project was also useful this year for Mr. Clark, who walked into each North Carolina member\u2019s office with the number of members in their districts.  Rep. Tom Rice (R., S.C.), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, says Republicans didn\u2019t consider provoking credit unions in this year\u2019s tax overhaul. \u201cI have heard both sides of the story from both sides of the spectrum and I do believe there is a space for [credit unions],\u201d he said. \u201cI think that place should be maintained.\u201d  Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com  \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Among people who currently have ACA benchmark plans, Oliver Wyman found those who are older and have lower incomes would generally see their costs for similar coverage increase the most under the House bill. Some with higher wages, and certain younger consumers, would likely do better financially under the new regime. Both urban and rural 35-year-olds making about $54,000 a year, for instance, could on average save roughly $3,000 annually, the analysis showed. In 2020, the House legislation would completely revamp the federal subsidies that currently help lower-income people afford insurance on the exchanges\u2014replacing them with flat-sum tax credits instead. While the ACA subsidies are pegged to a person\u2019s income and the costs of health plans in the geographic area where the recipient lives, the tax credits are based on age, with income limits. The Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans and could affect billions in revenues over the next decade. How are Democrats reacting?

["Health Policy", "The Oliver Wyman analysis highlights how rural areas, where individual insurance premiums are often higher, could see a major effect from the shift to flat-sum tax credits. Compounding that, rural populations are often older and poorer, so the proportion of those doing worse under the new subsidy setup may be higher. Of the 100 counties where a 62-year-old making three times the federal poverty level\u2014generally around $36,000\u2014would see the biggest jump in annual costs for a plan under the Republican blueprint, 97 were rural. \u201cIt is disproportionately affecting the rural,\u201d said Dianna Welch,  an actuary at Oliver Wyman. The dynamic may present a political challenge for Republicans, because many rural regions strongly supported President Donald Trump. A Wall Street Journal analysis of Oliver Wyman\u2019s data shows that 62-year-olds currently earning about $18,000 a year would see a bump in annual premiums of more than $10,000 in 41% of counties won by Mr. Trump last November, and in 28% of counties won by Hillary Clinton.  Kevin Brady,  the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said the analysis didn\u2019t reflect all aspects of the House bill. \u201cOur legislation eliminates the red tape, taxes, and mandates that have led to sky high premiums and a collapsing health care marketplace,\u201d he said in a statement."]

Mr. Vasey will be eligible for Medicare before 2020, but his wife is younger. \u201cIt would be a stretch,\u201d says Mr. Vasey. He might have to return to work or opt to begin receiving his Social Security benefits if the Republican approach becomes law, he said, and the couple would also consider a skimpier plan for Ms. Vasey, with bigger out-of-pocket costs.

For 62-year-olds earning about $18,000, the\u00a0average\u00a0increases in cost under the Republican bill\u2019s setup were far greater: $9,075 for rural and $6,954 for urban consumers. People with higher incomes could see their costs go down under the Republican proposal. For instance, a rural 62-year-old making about $54,000 would spend about $2,588 less per year for a plan on average under the Republican bill\u2019s subsidy structure, which gives tax credits to people at higher income levels than the ACA does.

But what many students and families may not realize is that successfully transitioning from a two-year college to a four-year one and graduating in a timely fashion can be a challenge\u2014and unless students can accomplish that, they may not reap the full return on their investment in education."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "The problem is, only 14% of degree-seeking students who entered community college in the fall of 2007 earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a four-year school within six years, according to a January study from the Community College Research Center at Teachers College, Columbia University. Among those who transferred to a four-year school, 42% earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in six years, the study found. By comparison, about 58% of students who enrolled in a four-year public school as freshmen in 2009 graduated within a six-year time-frame, according to the National Student Clearinghouse. \u201cWhen you talk to students who\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s almost amazing that anyone has gotten through,\u201d says Davis Jenkins,  a senior research associate at the Community College Research Center and one of the report\u2019s authors.  Experts say students who plan to start at community college and then transfer should have a plan to ensure the process goes smoothly. Here are some tips: One of the biggest challenges community-college students face is transferring their credits, Mr. Jenkins says. Less than 60% of community-college students successfully bring most of their credits to a four-year school and roughly 15% essentially have to start over, according to research published in 2015 in the journal Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis.  Alex T. Williams says he largely had to take the transfer process into his own hands, even though the two Texas colleges he attended had an agreement designed to make the transfer process easier. He met with advisers frequently, but often received contradictory information about what credits would carry over."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "\u201cI found the process very confusing and arcane,\u201d says the 29-year-old Mr. Williams, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication. So-called articulation agreements, which outline how and when credits will transfer, are common among in-state schools. But students need to review such agreements carefully, including any grade-point-average requirements, says Kevin Fudge,  the director of consumer advocacy and ombudsman at American Student Assistance, an organization focused on helping students pay for college and manage debt. Students also should ask advisers for help. \u201cDon\u2019t go it alone,\u201d he says.  Andy Lockwood,  a Jericho, N.Y.-based financial-aid consultant, suggests families sit down from the start with an admissions officer at the school to which the student plans to transfer to discuss which community-college classes will carry over and which won\u2019t. They should get something in writing, he says.  Jessica Elberfeld of Nashville, who enrolled in community college after graduating from high school in 2005, met early on with an admissions officer at Belmont University, the private four-year school to which she planned to transfer. She then picked her community-college courses based on material she received during that visit. \u201cStaying on the ball from day one and making sure those credits transferred really helped,\u201d says the 29-year-old Ms. Elberfeld, who graduated from Belmont in 2009 and now works as a sales representative for VF Imagewear. Ms. Elberfeld says she borrowed about $68,000 to attend Belmont, a sum she says would have been higher had she not spent two years at community college paid for through scholarships."]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "While students who manage the transfer process successfully may be able to cut their college costs by one-quarter to one-third, those who miss their ultimate destination\u2014a bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014may not reap as large a return on their education investment, says Mark Kantrowitz,  a financial-aid expert and the publisher of Cappex.com, a college scholarship and search site.  He believes there are benefits to enrolling in a four-year college from the start, and taking cheaper community-college classes on the side.  Working students and others who can\u2019t handle the 15 credits a semester typically needed to graduate on time, for example, might benefit by going to community college over the summer. \u201cYou can take the community-college classes to save money but you\u2019re in the four-year environment where people are there to get a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d which isn\u2019t always the case at a community college, Mr. Kantrowitz says. Enrolling in a four-year school as a freshman also may net students a more generous financial-aid package than they would get if they started as a transfer, he says. Cost isn\u2019t the only reason students might choose to start at community college.  Students who performed poorly in high school may be able to increase their chances of getting into a reputable four-year school by excelling academically at community college, says Mr. Lockwood. Some experts advise community-college students to zero in on a major as soon as possible. "]
["Journal Reports: Wealth Management", "Many four-year colleges expect students to know their major when transferring, Mr. Kantrowitz says, and some even require students to apply to a specific program or school and evaluate them based on the major they\u2019ve chosen. Knowing what they want to do early on allows community-college students to take the right prerequisite courses. Finally, students who plan to start at community college should aim to leave with an associate degree, experts say. Research indicates that transfer students with an associate degree are more likely to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree than those without, all other factors being equal. What\u2019s more, they will always have that credential to fall back on should they fail to graduate from the four-year school, Mr. Jenkins says. A winding path to a bachelor\u2019s degree may become more of the norm as college costs rise, experts say. But as long as students finish what they started, they are unlikely to be hurt by going to a less-prestigious school first.  \u201cIt matters where you finish not where you start,\u201d says Mr. Lockwood. \u201cEvery graduate-school admissions officer and every employer respects that.\u201d   Ms. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

["Technology", "The Japanese firm is leading a group of firms that plan to buy at least 14% of Uber by purchasing billions of dollars of shares from employees and investors at a valuation of $48 billion, and by investing at least $1 billion in the company at the previous valuation. As soon as Tuesday, SoftBank will officially declare its offer and sellers will have 20 business days to agree to the terms, according to people familiar with the matter.  The SoftBank consortium could raise the price of its bid if it doesn\u2019t reach the 14% threshold, other people familiar with the matter said. Representatives of Uber and SoftBank declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported the offer price. Some employees and investors have been waiting years for the opportunity to sell their stakes in the company and may not get another opportunity before Uber is expected to seek an initial public offering in 2019. Early investors could reap billions of dollars in the tender offer, including Benchmark Capital, which made an initial $27 million investment in the company, and now holds a stake worth over $8 billion. The investment deal, if successful, would transform the corporate structure\u00a0of the world\u2019s highly valued startup by adding as many as six directors and a series of voting changes, while\u00a0bringing some stability to Uber after a year of turbulence. For SoftBank, the deal is a high-stakes bet on the future of the car industry as the Japanese firm already owns big pieces of several fierce Uber competitors.\u00a0"]
["Technology", " But first, Uber and SoftBank have to hope enough shareholders and investors are willing to sell their shares at a steep discount. A big price cut is customary in so-called secondary shares because the stock can\u2019t be resold easily and the shares usually have fewer preferences\u2014such as protections if the company\u2019s value falls\u2014than those purchased directly from the company. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the SoftBank consortium in recent weeks discussed a valuation of around $50 billion. Some big investors have privately said they would balk if the valuation was too low. Former CEO Travis Kalanick,  who holds about 10% of Uber shares, has indicated he won\u2019t sell in the tender offer, while Benchmark Capital has wavered on whether it would sell some of its 13% stake. The investment deal has been complicated by Uber\u2019s disclosure last week of a massive data breach a year ago that netted two hackers some personal information of about 57 million drivers and riders. Uber paid $100,000 to the hackers to destroy the data and keep it quiet, these people said. From sexual harassment allegations to social media opposition, Uber's steered off the road. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains the company's missteps. Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal (Originally Published March 30, 2017). About a month ago, Uber disclosed to SoftBank that it was conducting an investigation into the hack and the broad strokes of the incident. It was unclear whether the disclosure weighed on investors\u2019 thinking about the offer price."]

However, at $450, it is still about twice as expensive as the average Android phone. It isn\u2019t clear how Apple plans to price the new phone. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. In the past, Apple has said used iPhones offer a lower-cost alternative for budget-conscious consumers. Apple doesn\u2019t get direct revenue from the sale of a used iPhone, but it benefits from an additional user who may spend on apps, movies or services."]
["Technology", "The iPhone\u2019s price premium mattered less when telecom carriers subsidized the upfront cost of a new phone. However, as more carriers move away from subsidies, Apple\u2019s higher prices appear more stark.  Mark Moskowitz,  a research analyst at Barclays, said the idea of lower prices is on the \u201ctop of everyone\u2019s mind\u201d but cautioned against it. He said Apple faces tough comparisons to last year\u2019s booming sales of its first larger-screen models. But he said the iPhone franchise is extremely strong and the next version\u2014the iPhone 7\u2014is expected to arrive later this year. Lowering prices may give the iPhone a \u201ccommodity feel,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s a tightrope.\" Apple has long benefited from its strategy. It accounts for about 14% of the global smartphone market, according to Strategy Analytics, and yet gobbles up nearly all of the industry\u2019s profits. That is true in other Apple product categories, such as tablets and computers. In each, Apple has relatively low market share and an outsize portion of the industry\u2019s profits. Even in emerging markets like China, Apple has thrived by sticking to the high-end of the market. The iPhone\u2019s hefty price tag helps it stand out from a fast-growing pack of low-cost smartphones and reinforces the view that it is higher quality. Apple's iPhone sales figures sent its stock price tumbling on Wednesday.

Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said higher prices played a role in the company\u2019s forecast that revenue will decline. \u201cInevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we\u2019re capturing that in our guidance,\u201d said Mr. Maestri.  For now, Apple seems focused on expanding revenue by other means. It wants to attach services to its base of iPhone users. For example, Apple said it has 10 million subscribers paying for its streaming music service. At $10 a month, Apple created a $1 billion-a-year business that didn\u2019t exist a year earlier. It is also looking to shorten the time between new iPhone purchases. Apple introduced the iPhone upgrade program in September that effectively turns the iPhone into a subscription service for customers who want a new phone every year.

One reason: The spread between what it costs refiners to buy crude and the price at which they can sell gasoline recently reached its highest point in nearly a year. That encouraged these companies to operate at a higher rate last month than during any April since 2001. Now, gasoline stockpiles are building during a season when inventories typically decline. Stockpiles added 191,000 barrels last week, according to EIA data released on Wednesday."]
["Commodities", "That was the third straight week of increases and a sharp contrast with the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s earlier estimate of a decline of 1.9 million barrels. Gasoline futures fell 3.4% to a five-month low on Thursday. On Thursday, crude oil dropped 4.8% to a five-month low at $45.52, dragged down by the ample gasoline supply, analysts say. New York crude is down 15% for the year. Until recently, U.S. crude prices traded within a narrow range of about $50 to $55 a barrel. Production cuts by the major oil-producing nations had limited price declines, while growing U.S. shale output held rallies in check. But the unexpected fuel surplus was a big reason why oil broke through the $50 a barrel late last month and has stayed below that level, traders said. \u201cGasoline going forward from here is going to be a big issue,\u201d said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division of Mizuho Securities USA. \u201cIt looks pretty grim.\u201d Refineries were comfortable producing more gasoline in part because they believed driver demand would soak up any excess as more people take to the road in warmer weather, Mr. Yawger said.  But so far this year, demand has been declining as prices at the pump have been rising. Retail gasoline prices averaged $2.417 in April, the highest since August 2015, according to EIA data. More expensive gasoline prices reflect higher oil prices this year and a seasonal shift to products used in the summer."]
["Commodities", "Even though gas prices are still cheap by historical standards, the increase over last year has a number of drivers rethinking their trips and how much to drive. Some said in interviews that they are using rewards points to fill their tanks. Slade Sizelove, a retired air-traffic controller in Alaska, said higher gas prices meant fewer trips this year to the ski resort, which is about 90 miles away from his home. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful this is the top for gasoline, but we usually don\u2019t see that until September,\u201d he said. Travis Ross, a 22-year-old YMCA sports assistant from Missouri City, Texas, said he and his friends have been carpooling more in response to rising prices at the pump.

More gasoline exports would help, Mr. Taylor added. But analysts say production from European and Asian refineries also has climbed, which has led to a well-supplied global market for gasoline."]
["Commodities", "A development that could further damp fuel demand: President Donald Trump said recently he would consider raising the federal gas tax to help fund his infrastructure plan. Still, the outlook for gasoline looks better than the beginning of the year, when storage reached its highest levels since 1990 and consumption fell to near a 15-year low. If drivers flock back to the road, a jump in summer demand could reduce a budding glut.

["Health Policy", "President Donald Trump came under swift pressure from conservative activists to force action by withdrawing federal funding for the already rickety insurance markets. But other Republicans and Democrats suggested different approaches, prolonging the unpredictability that has created a tricky landscape for insurers. Insurers had been pressing for legislation aimed at stabilizing the marketplaces, an idea that is likely to now move into the spotlight. But it isn\u2019t clear that any bill can move forward fast enough to affect the markets for next year, as insurers must file rates by mid-August and make final decisions about participation by late September.

I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode,\u201d Mr. Trump said."]
["Health Policy", "The president has on occasion publicly mulled cutting off monthly payments to insurers, which next come due in three weeks. Other administration officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price,  have said they are open to using executive action to loosen ACA rules, which could include relaxing the requirement that most people have insurance or pay a penalty. For the skittish insurance industry, the sheer range of possibilities comes at a sensitive time. Insurers are on the cusp of making decisions about their prices and participation in states\u2019 individual insurance markets next year.  \u201cWe\u2019re worried,\u201d said Martin Hickey, chief executive of New Mexico Health Connections, a nonprofit insurer. \u201cWe need answers very soon to make good, responsible decisions\u2026. You can\u2019t have functioning markets in uncertainty.\u201d Some Republicans suggested pivoting to bipartisan legislation that would fund the insurer payments and shore up the insurance markets. Other GOP lawmakers said they weren\u2019t giving up the repeal effort yet, even as Democratic supporters of the ACA cheered themselves for having saved the health law again. \u201cLast night\u2019s horrific failure is not the final chapter in the debate,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \u201cI know that the president and vice president have spent most of the morning reaching out to senators on possible ideas that could gain the support of a majority of the upper chamber,\u201d Mr. Meadows said. \u201cThey are encouraging a number of key negotiators to stay involved in these first few weeks of August.\u201d"]
["Health Policy", "The White House said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham had visited with the president Friday but didn\u2019t confirm other meetings or calls. The political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation said the Trump administration should stop making \u201ccost-sharing reduction\u201d payments, which reimburse insurers for lowering copays and deductibles for millions of low-income people who get coverage under the ACA. Those payments have been challenged in court by House Republicans, who argue the funds were never authorized by Congress. A federal judge has sided with the House but allowed the payments to continue until the litigation concludes. \u201cThe administration should certainly make clear that they\u2019re not interested in throwing more money at Obamacare,\u201d said Dan Holler, a spokesman for the Heritage Foundation\u2019s political arm, Heritage Action. Insurers say the loss of the cost-sharing payments would push up rates and convince more companies to exit from the markets where consumers buy subsidized coverage under the ACA. Already, several insurers have cited the uncertainty in announcing pullbacks for next year, while others have already built extra cushions into their 2018 rate requests. More insurers have been raising red flags in recent days, including\n            Anthem\n Inc.,\n      which said Wednesday that if it doesn\u2019t quickly get more certainty about the future of the individual insurance market, it would likely further pull back its planned participation for next year.

Rep. Michael Burgess (R., Texas) said the prospect of the individual mandate\u2019s disappearance had brought insurers to his office Thursday to discuss offering products that would appeal to healthy customers buying them voluntarily. Mr. Burgess has said he is open to the Trump administration using executive action where it can, but said Friday he didn\u2019t want to see steps taken on the individual mandate in that way now. \u201cPeople need the certainty of settled law,\u201d Mr. Burgess said. \u201cThere are some temporary things that could be done by the administration, but realistically\u201d significant actions need to be taken by Congress. Some Republicans on Friday stepped up their pursuit of bipartisan legislation to prop up insurers in the short term. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), who chairs the Senate\u2019s health committee, is expected to hold hearings on stabilizing the individual insurance market.  Senators are also considering including an appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments, along with other kinds of short-term stabilization funding, to a reauthorization of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which is popular with both parties."]

Some 72% of 4.58 million eligible voters took part in Monday\u2019s referendum, the commission said. Western nations, including the U.S., had urged the semi-autonomous Kurdish region to cancel or postpone the vote, predicting it would unleash further chaos in the Middle East. Although the result doesn\u2019t automatically translate into statehood, Kurdish leaders hope it will advance that dream by giving them a mandate to negotiate an amicable separation from the central government in Baghdad over the coming years. But Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said there will be no talks between his government and Kurdish leaders after the referendum, and that he won\u2019t recognize its outcome."]
["Middle East News", "Iraq\u2019s parliament on Wednesday authorized Mr. Abadi to take a range of countermeasures against the Kurds, such as deploying forces to disputed territories where the referendum was held and regaining control of oil wells in the Kurdish-controlled northern city of Kirkuk.  Mr. Abadi, who has vowed to keep the country whole without using force, said at the parliament session that the Kurds had been duly warned of the \u201cdangerous consequences\u201d of their vote. \u201cThe federal government will impose its authority on the Kurdistan region the same as other Iraqi provinces with the power of the constitution and law,\u201d he said.

Non-Kurdish citizens of the areas where the referendum was held were also eligible to vote, although many said they opposed it.  Heather Nauert, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, on Tuesday encouraged dialogue between Baghdad and Kurdish leaders in Erbil, calling the proposed flight ban not constructive. The U.S. has opposed the referendum, saying it would distract from crucial final Iraqi military efforts to dislodge Islamic State from its remaining footholds in the country. Some of the strongest threats have come from Turkey and Iran, which fear any move towards independence by Iraq\u2019s Kurds sets a dangerous precedent for their own Kurdish populations. Tehran closed its airspace to flights from the region on the eve of the vote, and Ankara has threatened to shut an oil-export pipeline on which the Kurds depend economically.

The problem is that market perceptions on China have grown disproportionately to real progress."]
["Heard on the Street", "The improvement in steel and coal finances\u2014the two most vulnerable indebted sectors\u2014has been real. Both industries were close to insolvent by late 2015, with aggregate operating earnings just 1.5 times and 1.8 times interest costs, respectively. Two years later, the ratio in both sectors is around 5 times. Unfortunately, only part of this improvement is due to capacity cuts. The other factor is the enormous, old-school stimulus unleashed in late 2015, which pumped up the real-estate market and commodity demand. The repayment ability of coal and steel firms tends to follow the real-estate investment cycle closely, suggesting that has more to do with improving industrial margins than relatively modest capacity cuts.  China\u2019s financial vulnerability to a real-estate downturn\u2014now starting to unfold again\u2014remains worryingly high. Corporate debt ticked down by a measly 1% of GDP in the first quarter of 2017, according to the Bank for International Settlements, after rising by nearly 50 percentage points over the past five years. Close to 40% of the total is located in the real-estate, construction, mining, and steel sectors, all intimately linked to the property market. Steel firms alone had 4.4 trillion yuan ($665.72 billion) of debt at the end of 2016 (4% of GDP), according to researchers at the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office."]
["Heard on the Street", "Chinese financial markets have started to catch on. Steel prices are up 20% since June\u2014but steel and coal firms such as\n      \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nHangzhou Iron & Steel\n            \n      and Yanzhou Coal Mining have sold off sharply since the summer, and bond investors continue to demand far shorter durations for coal debt than in other industries. Banks, which are being asked by Beijing to convert steel debt into equity, are dragging their feet. Fewer steel mills competing for business will still be a positive next year\u2014and continuing government efforts to buy up empty apartments mean the property downturn will probably be less painful than in 2015. But no one should delude themselves into thinking China\u2019s debt problem has really turned the corner. To spring itself from the sturdy debt trap built in the years after the 2008 crash, China needs to keep credit growth in check and keep steel, coal and apartment prices reasonably high. History suggests doing both won\u2019t be easy.

The feud between Turkey and the Netherlands, which had been brewing for days, boiled over Saturday night, when Dutch authorities deported a Turkish minister from Rotterdam as she attempted to hold an unauthorized political rally. Turkish reaction was swift: Government officials accused officials in the Netherlands of being fascists and Nazis. They said the Dutch ambassador to Turkey, who is currently abroad on leave, wasn\u2019t welcome back for a while, and threatened diplomatic, political and economic retaliation unless the Netherlands apologized for the incident. "]
["Europe News", "\u201cTurkey is a partner. We are interested in normalizing relations but we can\u2019t be bullied,\u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s spokesman, Tim Versnel, said in an interview. The Netherlands would never meet Turkey\u2019s demand for an official apology, he added. A rally of Turkish expatriates turned violent in Rotterdam, Mr. Versnel said, while demonstrators staged protests outside the Netherlands\u2019 missions in Ankara and Istanbul. Turkish hackers also claimed attacks on Dutch targets, including one that downed the Rotterdam-The Hague airport website. It was back online by Sunday evening.  The spat with Turkey, on which European countries depend to curb refugee flows from the Syrian war, comes ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Dutch elections and elections in France and Germany. In all three countries, nationalist politicians have been benefiting from anti-immigrant sentiment. \u201cThe situation is now damaging to diplomacy and democracy. We cannot allow it to escalate any further,\u201d said Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary general of the Council of Europe, whose 47 members include Turkey and European Union countries. The Netherlands denied requests for Turkish rallies that Mr. Rutte said threatened to fuel domestic tensions, as his main rival Geert Wilders of the far-right Freedom Party campaigns on a platform of expelling Muslims. That move angered Turkish officials, who are campaigning in Turkey\u2014and in European cities like Rotterdam with large Turkish populations\u2014for a yes vote in an April 16 referendum on whether to expand President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s powers.

["Politics and Policy", "House Republicans plan to make their changes Thursday and push the bill toward a vote by the full House as soon as next week. The Senate bill, expected to be released Thursday, will likely differ from the House version by preserving the medical-expense deduction, fully repealing individual deductions for state and local income and property taxes, and not repealing the estate tax. \u201cThere are some areas where we have a different approach,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) The simultaneous negotiations in the House and Senate left the GOP tax bills in flux. Republicans remain confident they can deliver a sizable tax cut, but they have slim margins in both chambers and are trying to squeeze their plans inside budgetary constraints. The $74 billion gap in the House bill stems from an amendment Republicans made late Monday that would scale back an excise tax on multinational corporations proposed in the first version of the GOP bill. The change removed 95% of that key revenue-raising provision, leaving the bill outside its budget target, according to an estimate provided Tuesday by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan scorekeeper for tax legislation in Congress. The bill\u2019s author, Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), said it was \u201cnot unusual\u201d for amendments to push a bill outside its revenue target. He said Republicans are looking at options. Those include repealing the individual mandate to purchase health insurance.  \u201cWe continue to weigh the scores from the Joint Committee on Taxation and drive toward that final amendment,\u201d Mr. Brady told reporters late Wednesday, offering no detail."]

Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.) and other Democrats have pressed Mr. Brady to give them time to review any major changes in the works.

You can\u2019t put a size 12 foot in a size 7 shoe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears to me as though substantial change is coming in their proposals.\u201d Democrats have been hammering the GOP bill, arguing that it benefits high-income households and removes valuable deductions for items such as medical expenses and student loan interest."]
["Politics and Policy", "The shape of a companion Senate tax plan was in flux Wednesday, with Republicans on the tax-writing Finance Committee set to hold more meetings later in the day. Senate Republicans said they were aiming to release their tax plan Thursday. One of the main policies yet to be worked out was whether to delay for a year a planned cut in the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. Senate Republicans, who were coming under White House pressure to immediately implement the rate cut, said they still hadn\u2019t settled the question. \u201cThe goal is to get the cut started as quickly as possible. The only question is what the definition of \u2018as quickly as possible\u2019 is, and whether that\u2019s a year, whether that\u2019s January\u2014we have not determined that as far as I know,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.), a member of the panel. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been locked in.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called the 20% corporate rate one of the most important elements of the tax plan.  President Donald Trump \u201cfeels very strongly he wants to start this right away,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cHaving said that, we\u2019ll have to look at the entire Senate package. I assume it\u2019s really just a money issue as to how they\u2019re moving the different pieces around.\u201d Republicans are still optimistic about their chances of passing a major rewrite of the tax code."]
["Politics and Policy", "But the fluctuating revenue estimates of the House bill present a new challenge. The 20% excise tax that House Republicans put in the bill they unveiled last week was designed to prevent companies from shifting profits out of the U.S. to low-tax countries, and the original version generated $154.5 billion over a decade to help pay for other tax cuts. The tax would apply to payments from companies with U.S. operations to related parties in foreign countries. After complaints from businesses, including foreign-based auto makers, Republicans made a series of changes, adopted on a party-line vote late Monday. According to the JCT, the amendments gave back $147.5 billion of that revenue. Business groups said the changes didn\u2019t go far enough to address their concerns. It isn\u2019t clear whether Republicans will alter that tax further. Other changes led to additional cuts of $13 billion, making the bill a $1.574 trillion tax cut\u2014beyond the revenue target of $1.5 trillion over a decade. For technical budgetary reasons, the shortfall may be even greater. Staying inside the revenue target isn\u2019t necessarily a fatal problem in the House, and Republicans have time to address the issue. But a shortfall would present a challenge in the Senate, where it could keep Republicans from passing the bill without Democratic votes. Foreign taxes aren\u2019t the only area Republicans may adjust. Lawmakers have also talked about new changes for life insurers. And they are trying to respond to concerns about a 25% tax rate for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations."]
["Politics and Policy", "Groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business say not enough businesses would benefit from the 25% rate. That is because professional-services businesses generally wouldn\u2019t get the break. Neither would businesses whose owners are in the 25% marginal tax bracket or below. The bracket above that would start at $200,000 for individuals and $260,000 for married couples filing jointly. Any of those changes would require Republicans to find offsetting revenue elsewhere. One possibility emerged more clearly on Wednesday. JCT and the Congressional Budget Office released a new estimate showing that repealing the individual mandate to purchase health insurance would yield $338 billion over a decade. Repealing the mandate generally raises money because fewer people would have insurance, and the government would thus spend less money on subsidies and Medicaid. But some Republicans worry about the political problems that come with adding health-policy questions to an already complicated tax bill. Rep. Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio) said he was concerned about a piece of his party\u2019s plan that would eliminate tax-free private-activity bonds that finance hospitals, nursing homes and other projects. He said he was looking for a way to keep some of the program. \u201cThe chairman has a really tough job, a balancing act that would be equivalent to someone on a circus wire,\u201d Mr. Tiberi said.

The new approach, contrary to its usual online retail offering to the masses, could prove a tactic for entering new markets and attracting high-income shoppers where the U.S. e-commerce firm doesn\u2019t yet operate. For the first time, the Seattle-based retailer is tackling a new country by initially offering Prime Now, its fast-delivery option that offers a smaller selection of food, necessities and gifts. Amazon later plans to introduce Prime membership, which consumers pay a monthly or annual fee to use. Prime Now is usually offered as an add-on to Prime."]
["Technology", "\u201cIn Singapore, the fact that we don\u2019t have a classic, local dot-com offering, that\u2019s been really interesting, to think about how that\u2019s going to work for customers,\u201d said Stephenie Landry, vice president of Prime Now. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking up new solutions that are required for places where we don\u2019t have such a well-worn path established yet.\u201d Amazon has been pushing into a number of new foreign markets, most recently Australia, as it works to maintain its growth in both sales and Prime members.   Prime customers spend double their non-Prime counterparts, according to UBS analyst estimates. Amazon has about 63 million Prime members in North America, UBS estimates, nearly twice the number abroad, leading to expectations of larger gains in membership internationally. While Amazon has a presence in Japan, China and India, Singapore is its first major foray into a smaller Asian country. The city-state of about 5.6 million people has high average income levels, a business-friendly government and an urban environment that allows for straightforward and easier deliveries, said Florian Hoppe, a partner at Bain & Co. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many cities with such concentrated purchasing power in Southeast Asia,\u201d said Mr. Hoppe. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to dip your toes into the region.\u201d Many of the consumers are affluent and already shop overseas, said Xiaofeng Wang, a senior analyst at Forrester. Singapore consumers buy on Amazon\u2019s Japanese, European and U.S. websites for import goods, Ms. Landry said, purchases that are informing the Prime Now offering. The country\u2019s heavy mobile usage makes it a good candidate for shopping on the Prime Now app."]
["Technology", "But the market could still prove tough to crack. Stores with food and necessities are often just a short walk downstairs. And popular local online players such as Alibaba Group Holdings-backed Lazada Group and eBay.com Inc.-backed website Qoo10 already sell everything from smartphones to facial creams. Alibaba said in June it is plowing an additional $1 billion into Lazada, which operates online stores for international brands and merchants in six countries in Southeast Asia.  In addition, Amazon will have to create new methods to ship in merchandise to restock its Prime Now warehouse rather than relying on an existing Amazon supply chain and logistics network because it is starting from scratch. Prime Now, which has been around for nearly three years, is now in nine countries. In Singapore, one-hour deliveries will cost 9.99 Singapore dollars (about $7.30). If customers spend a minimum of 40 Singapore dollars, two-hour shipping will be free. Until the introduction of Prime membership, it will be open to any Singapore resident, and the company will offer local brands such as Tiger Balm herbal ointments and foreign labels such as L\u2019Oreal, Pampers and\n            Samsung\n,\n      Ms. Landry said. It will also sell items like board games, baby strollers and groceries. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get this really unique set of selection, all in one place,\u201c Ms. Landry said. \u201dThat obviously creates logistical challenges.\"  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com"]

"]
["Technology", "The optimistic tone is a reversal from last quarter\u2019s report, when Tesla warned of monthslong delays in the production of the Model 3 and raised the possibility the company could pump the brakes on planned growth. Tesla on Wednesday reported yet another record loss\u2014$675 million attributable to common shareholders\u2014but unlike three months ago, the loss on an adjusted basis was narrower than what analysts were expecting. This year \u201cwill be a transformative year for Tesla, with a high level of operational scaling,\u201d Chief Executive Elon Musk wrote Wednesday in a letter to shareholders. \u201cAs we ramp production of both Model 3 and our energy products while keeping tight control of operating expenses, our quarterly operating income should turn sustainably positive at some point in 2018.\u201d  Tesla also improved its cash flow during the quarter\u2014burning just $277 million in free cash\u2014crediting a delay in investments for the Model 3, a sell-down of inventories of Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles and a 24% increase in customer deposits from three months earlier. While the company doesn\u2019t break out which products collected those reservations during the quarter, Tesla revealed a new semitrailer truck and a high-end sports car that will cost as much as $250,000.  In after-hours trading on Wednesday, Tesla\u2019s shares fluctuated around the $345 closing price, after rising 3.3% during regular hours."]
["Technology", "Amid the buoyant predictions, Tesla cautioned shareholders that the company has encountered \u201cdifficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.\u201d The company often misses its targets, as it did with the Model 3 in the fourth quarter, when it sold only about 1,550 of the sedans, and fell short of hitting the 5,000-a-week goal by the end of the year. Deliveries of the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle helped boost unit sales by 35% during the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Tesla sold a record 102,807 vehicles last year mainly on the back of those two pricey cars, which typically sell for about $100,000. But investor attention is focused heavily on the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 and is a key pillar of Mr. Musk\u2019s strategy to remake the luxury auto maker as a more mainstream company that offers electric cars, solar panels and batteries for power storage. Last November, Tesla acknowledged it was struggling to ramp up the Model 3 due to the complexity of the battery-pack assembly and its automated manufacturing process. It has suffered from bottlenecks at the assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., and at the battery factory near Reno, Nev. Cars are assembled by robots at Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif.Photo: Joseph White/REUTERS Tesla has received about 500,000 reservations to buy the Model 3, so the question is how quickly it can crank up production to meet the demand. The company\u2019s website currently says it will take about 12 to 18 months to get a Model 3 delivered if reserved today."]
["Technology", "In 2016, Mr. Musk had said he expected to make as many as 200,000 Model 3s in the second half of 2017 and that the company would reach 500,000 total production in 2018. Instead, Tesla, which began production of the compact car in July, built roughly 2,400 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, making Mr. Musk\u2019s dream of producing a half million vehicles a year, including the Model S and Model X, look unlikely anytime soon.  Model 3 delays threaten to eat into Tesla\u2019s limited cash. Tesla ended 2017 with $3.4 billion in cash on hand after spending $787 million on capital expenditures for Model 3 and battery production during the fourth quarter. That was less than Tesla had forecast in November when it said it planned to spend about $1 billion. The company said it delayed spending on the Model 3 until the first quarter.  Tesla plans to spend slightly more on capital expenditures this year compared with the $3.4 billion spent in 2017, the company said. The auto maker plans to add capacity at its assembly plant to be able to make 10,000 Model 3 sedans a week after reaching the 5,000-a-week milestone, Mr. Musk wrote.  Analysts expect Tesla will have to raise additional money this year, and with the delays, their expectations for the company\u2019s ability to turn a profit have deflated. About a year ago, the consensus among analysts surveyed by FactSet estimated Tesla turning an annual adjusted profit of $1.46-a-share in 2018, a view that has flipped to a loss of $4.16 a share. In 2017, the company, which has never posted an annual profit, lost $1.96 billion, or $11.83 a share."]
["Technology", "Despite the hurdles, Mr. Musk continues to stoke enthusiasm among investors and fans. Shares of the company have soared more than 7% this year so far, giving it a market value that rivals\n            General Motors\n Co.\n      , the largest U.S. auto maker by sales.  Tesla also seems to benefit from Mr. Musk\u2019s involvement with his other company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which on Tuesday launched the world\u2019s most powerful rocket in almost five decades that carried a Tesla sports car as a test-payload. Last month, Tesla announced that the company\u2019s board had approved a compensation package for Mr. Musk that aims for the company to reach a market value of $650 billion, about 10 times its current value. In the fourth quarter, Tesla\u2019s $675 million loss attributable to common shareholders compared with $121 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company recorded a per-share loss of $3.04, beating the $3.11 predicted by a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet.

Mr. Erdogan on Sunday night declared victory, while his opposition vowed to challenge the results. Voters narrowly approved constitutional amendments that will vastly expand Mr. Erdogan\u2019s power, giving him license to politically transform a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member that the U.S. and Europe have come to rely as a partner in the fight against Islamic State, the Syrian war and efforts to curb the flow of migrants from the Middle East to the European Union. The White House declined to comment Sunday about the results of the referendum. "]
["World News", "A representative for the State Department said they were following the referendum voting outcome but would refrain from commenting until the results have been confirmed and would also await the initial findings from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been observing the referendum.  Among Mr. Erdogan\u2019s first moves Sunday night was to say he would seek to reinstate the death penalty, which Turkey scrapped as a condition for starting accession talks with the EU. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said such a step is in \u201cno way compatible\u201d with EU membership. Other officials have said it would mean the immediate end of accession talks. Still on Sunday evening, European reaction to the vote was cautious. In a statement, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and two other top officials said they had taken note of the reported results in Turkey but would await the assessment of international monitors on the vote including on \u201calleged irregularities.\u201d Turkish officials said ahead of the vote that there would be no abrupt changes in Ankara\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cOn NATO, U.S. relations there will definitely be no change. Turkey\u2019s regional power and position with its allies is clear,\u201d said Reha Denemec, a chief adviser to Mr. Erdogan. For the Trump administration, a strengthened Mr. Erdogan might mean securing an agreement on a plan to oust Islamic State from Raqqa in Syria, the extremist jihadist group\u2019s de facto capital. The U.S. has long relied on Syrian Kurdish forces that Turkey considers terrorists to fight Islamic State, stoking tensions among the NATO allies, but his referendum victory could give Mr. Erdogan latitude to be more flexible, American officials said."]
["World News", "The course of relations with the European Union looks more complicated.  A steady drumbeat of criticism from Brussels and EU governments over Turkey\u2019s alleged human-rights abuses and the erosion of the rule of law regularly strains relations, and the tensions could mount as Mr. Erdogan consolidates power. \u201cOur concern is that Erdogan will just rush ahead and\u2026go towards what is basically one-man rule,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cLet\u2019s not sugarcoat it.\u201d Ahead of the referendum, Mr. Erdogan charged the EU with meddling in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs and advocated reinstating capital punishment.  In recent months, Mr. Erdogan has slammed the West for its slow response to last July\u2019s military coup and repeatedly threatened to tear up a migration deal with Europe that has helped stem the flow of Syrian refugees into the bloc. Ankara is angry that more than a year after the deal, the EU hasn\u2019t provided visa-free travel to Europe for Turkish nationals or accelerated Turkey\u2019s stalled accession talks to join the EU. European officials say both steps depend on political reforms at home. Frustrated with what he sees as European insincerity and foot-dragging, Mr. Erdogan has called for a plebiscite on whether to continue membership talks with Brussels. \u201cI view the current referendum as a referendum on the EU accession, because a country with such a constitution could never join the EU,\u201d said Kati Piri,  a Dutch member of the European Parliament who handles relations with Turkey. \u2014Josh Zumbrun in Washington contributed to this article."]

It\u2019s also announced expansion to San Diego, Seattle, Las Vegas and Fort Lauderdale."]
["The Middle Seat", "This is not aviation\u2019s version of a knockoff handbag. With Mint, the prices are lower but the recline remains fully flat, the pillows and duvets still soft. Service may lack some frills, but the airline still offers amenity kits with eyeshades and lemon towelettes. And it has a real following with experienced fliers. A few celebrities have raved about it on social media. The roomy cabin at the front is made possible by new single-aisle planes that are bigger and can fly long distances. JetBlue began buying the\n            Airbus\n            \n      A321, 23 feet longer than its regular A320. The A321s with Mint have almost as many coach seats as JetBlue\u2019s standard A320, but 16 extra business-class seats. Entertainment-industry executive Reece Pearson flies more than 100,000 miles a year with\n            American Airlines\n,\n      but when he travels from Los Angeles to New York every two to three weeks, he flies JetBlue Mint. \u201cThe [business-class seat] on American is probably a little more comfortable, but American does not have DirecTV,\u201d he says. The main difference is price. He routinely books business class on JetBlue for about $1,500 round trip, compared with $2,300 to $2,400 on American. \u201cNow most of our company flies Mint,\u201d says Mr. Pearson, chief operating officer of a music talent management firm."]
["The Middle Seat", "The transcon market went lie-flat in 2013 when\n            Delta Air Lines\n            \n      brought international widebody aircraft onto the New York-Los Angeles route and began selling business-class tickets with seats that folded out into beds. American rolled out an Airbus A321 with just 102 seats, including 10 first-class suites and 20 business-class lie-flat beds. An unusual configuration of a single seat behind a row of two seats gives a few passengers a suite to themselves in JetBlue\u2019s Mint cabin.Photo: JetBlue The luxury on five-hour flights was a hit, leading prices to soar. JetBlue, realizing that many of its customers were willing to pay extra for luxury on long flights, too, unveiled Mint in summer 2014. American and Delta tried to hang on to their higher prices for a time, but in the past year prices have started to fall, fare-tracker Bob Harrell says. His firm studied the discounted and full-fare business-class prices offered by airlines for the same period in February the past four years and found dramatic cuts were made once JetBlue started to catch on. Discounted business-class prices offered by Delta and American averaged about $2,200 one-way in the 2014 snapshot, but this year averaged about $1,300 for the same period. Full-fare business-class tickets averaged $2,900 one-way before Mint. Delta\u2019s full-fare prices were about 25% lower than the same time last year."]
["The Middle Seat", "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a JetBlue impact here,\u201d Mr. Harrell says. JetBlue\u2019s Mint prices have gone up since its launch, Mr. Harrell notes and JetBlue confirms, as the cabin has filled up faster. American tailored its transcon service for high-end customers to be similar to long-haul international service, says Fern Fernandez,  vice president of global marketing. Improvements such as fancier lounges with sit-down restaurant dining are under construction in New York and L.A. And discount competitors don\u2019t offer American\u2019s direct plane-to-plane connections in Cadillacs. JetBlue opted for tapas-style small-plate offerings for food service in business class. Passengers get a choice of two or three items from a menu.Photo: JetBlue The airline thinks it\u2019s staying a step ahead of Mint and others on the New York-Los Angeles route, the busiest long-distance domestic route. JetBlue doesn\u2019t disclose financial results on Mint but the cabin is more profitable, per square foot, than coach, says Joanna Geraghty,  JetBlue\u2019s executive vice president, customer experience. Despite its parsimonious roots, JetBlue tries to mimic many of the front-cabin luxuries to which premium fliers are accustomed. Flight attendants who work in the Mint cabin get special training in hospitality. Drinks are offered before takeoff, including a special lemonade blend with, you guessed it, mint. (JetBlue says the name is meant to evoke a refreshing feeling and not the herb or minting money.) Seats have lumbar massagers, reading lights, electric plugs and a \u201cwake me\u201d light you can press to notify flight attendants you want to be awakened for food service."]
["The Middle Seat", "One annoyance: All bags have to be in overhead bins for takeoff and landing, so you can\u2019t keep a briefcase at your feet. What\u2019s most prized among savvy fliers are the Mint suites. On each side of the A321, JetBlue puts two seats in a row, then a row behind with just a single seat on each side. When seats fold down, the legs of the single passenger are tucked between the two passengers in front. The single passenger has a sliding door, creating an enclosed suite. The four suites cost the same as the 12 other business-class seats and usually get booked first. \u201cThe biggest complaint is the single seat sells so fast,\u201d says Marty St. George,  JetBlue executive vice president, commercial and planning. New York insurance executive Kenneth King is a happy Delta regular. But for the past six months he\u2019s flown Mint on four trips out to Los Angeles. \u201cOn other airlines, the service is not as good, the accommodations are not as good and the price is sometimes two times more expensive,\u201d he says. He\u2019s happiest in the single-seat suite. \u201cIt\u2019s like a mobile office,\u201d he says.  His only complaints with Mint: \u201cThe food is not great,\u201d he says, and at 6-foot-4, he can\u2019t fully stretch out in the bed even though JetBlue says the bed is 6 feet, 8 inches long. (The area for feet narrows considerably.) \u201cJetBlue is always considered a discount carrier, and the first time I did this, I wasn\u2019t sure what the experience was going to be,\u201d says Mr. King. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised.\u201d"]

["Markets Main", "Strong corporate earnings and improving economic growth world-wide have fueled the gains, with the new U.S. tax law, which cuts corporate rates to 21% from 35%, bolstering optimism. The weaker U.S. dollar has been a boon to emerging markets and the recent pickup in Treasury yields has prompted a rotation out of bonds and into stocks, further propelling equity markets, investors say. The gains have also put some investors on edge, intensifying analysts\u2019 concerns about the rising price of buying into a bull market almost nine years old. The rallies have also drawn comparisons to the 2000 Nasdaq peak, when a mania for technology stocks drove the index to a level that it wouldn\u2019t recapture for more than a dozen years. While U.S. stocks have been generally expensive relative to historical norms in recent decades, Jim Paulsen,  chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, pointed out last week that the median price-to-earnings multiple for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange has reached a record high.  \u201cFor the first time in this recovery, the stock market has finally become expensive based on its \u2018new valuation range,\u2019\u201d Mr. Paulsen said in a note to clients, referring to that record-high price-to-earnings multiple.

The surge in U.S. stock indexes this year has extended a roaring postelection rally that few analysts predicted, taking the S&P 500 index to 14 record closes in 2018, alongside 13 in the Nasdaq Composite Index and 11 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Don\u2019t sacrifice truth for social cohesion.\u201d That culture is now under scrutiny as the company faces allegations from a former engineer who said last week that managers dismissed her sexual-harassment complaints because the accused employee was a top performer. Corporate meritocracies are often anything but. Many management experts say that left unchecked, purely meritocratic organizations can be bruising workplaces in which employees act more like competitors than colleagues, and bosses ignore inherent biases. Research has found that such environments tend to favor men and can be particularly tough on women. Within companies, a relentless push for meritocracy can backfire, leaving employees feeling unfairly treated."]
["Management & Careers", "\u201cNo organization is purely meritocratic, so even claiming you\u2019re building a meritocratic culture shows you\u2019re probably not aware of these biases,\u201d says Joelle Emerson, a former sexual-harassment litigator who as chief executive of consulting startup Paradigm has advised firms such as Slack Technologies Inc. and Pinterest Inc. on workforce diversity. Most Silicon Valley companies value meritocracy, arguing that corporate bureaucracy shouldn\u2019t get in the way of talent and hard work. Likewise, few employees would want to work in a company that didn\u2019t advance people on the basis of their accomplishments.  Uber\u2019s commitment to what it views as clearing the way for the best and brightest has aided its rapid rise from a scrappy startup to one with a valuation of $68 billion, some 11,000 employees and operations in 70 countries. Former and current workers say it has also resulted in an internal culture in which employees can freely intrude on others\u2019 work and the highest performers are rarely checked on their behavior. Uber declined to comment more specifically on its workplace culture. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick has launched an internal investigation into the allegations made by former engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti, calling the behavior she described \u201cabhorrent\u201d and saying it was the first he had heard of it. The company has brought in board member Arianna Huffington and hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to help lead the internal investigation. Ms. Fowler Rigetti hasn\u2019t commented beyond her blog post."]
["Management & Careers", "Tech giants such as\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\u2019s\n      Google have sought to reinvent work as much as technology, rejecting old ways of management and offering employees the chance to get ahead on the strength of their work alone. As they mature, tech firms often bring in processes to root out bias and promote diversity. However, like much of Silicon Valley, many of these companies have remained largely white and male-dominated. GitHub for years touted its largely boss-free, meritocratic culture, installing at one point a centerpiece rug in its former San Francisco waiting room\u2014then decorated like the Oval Office\u2014emblazoned with \u201cUnited Meritocracy of GitHub.\u201d The rug was removed in 2014, following a furor on social media, particularly among women, who complained using the word \u201cmeritocracy\u201d belied how few women were in senior roles in the technology industry. \u201cWe thought \u2018meritocracy\u2019 was a neat way to think of open source [collaboration] but now see the problems with it,\u201d GitHub CEO Chris Wanstrath tweeted at the time. \u201cWords matter. We\u2019re getting a new rug.\u201d Around the same time, a former employee alleged that she faced harassment, calling GitHub a hostile workplace for women. While a company investigation found no gender-based harassment took place, it concluded that a lack of workplace boundaries was part of the problem and had exacerbated a conflict involving the employee."]
["Management & Careers", "Github\u2019s president and co-founder stepped down, acknowledging that he had mishandled events leading to the employee\u2019s resignation. Mr. Wanstrath has since created more clear human-resources procedures, the company said, replacing its flat hierarchy based strictly on meritocracy with a more formal reporting structure. In a 2010 experiment, researchers at the MIT Sloan School of Management and Indiana University asked 445 business-school participants to simulate managerial roles and award bonuses to employees according to either merit-based guidelines or their own discretion. In what the researchers called the \u201cparadox of meritocracy,\u201d the meritocratic managers rewarded fictional male employees with bonuses on average $46 higher than those given to equally performing women. The participants who used their own discretion, on the other hand, rewarded women workers with a higher bonus than the men. \u201cBias hides under meritocracy,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, a longtime advocate for diversity in technology who, with her husband, Mitch Kapor, was an early investor in Uber. The pair last week published an open letter to Uber\u2019s board and investors, describing their unsuccessful attempts to change the company\u2019s culture from behind the scenes and criticizing the company for tapping mostly insiders to carry out the probe. \u201cWe will be thorough, impartial and objective, and we are conducting this review with the highest degree of integrity and professionalism,\u201d Mr. Holder, who has done previous advisory work for Uber, and his law partner Tammy Albarr\u00e1n responded in a statement."]
["Management & Careers", "Different approaches to meritocracy exist within Uber, people familiar with the matter said. In interviews, current and former employees said it was generally understood that \u201ctoe-stepping\u201d meant that confrontation was allowed, so long as it furthered the company\u2019s goals. \u201cThis is not the place to go if you want a comfy, cushy experience,\u201d said Chris Messina, an Uber developer advocate who left the company earlier this year and describes the environment as one where sharp-elbowed workers vie for Mr. Kalanick\u2019s attention. \u201cYou have to be willing to move fast, and that can lead to some conflict.\u201d But at Otto, the self-driving truck unit Uber agreed to buy last summer for about $680 million, the same meritocracy principle is described more benignly in its list of core values: \u00a0\u201cSuccess is rewarded\u2014It\u2019s about progressing the goal, not yourself.\u201d \nNetflix\n Inc.\u2019s\n      intense work culture places a premium on merit, demanding that employees be \u201ctenacious\u201d high-performers, take \u201csmart risks\u201d and say what they think \u201ceven if it is controversial,\u201d according to a slide-deck on its website that outlines the company\u2019s values.

["Markets Main", "The price, which traded as high as $1,326 on Friday in anticipation of a possible approval, plummeted to as low as $1,022 after the SEC decision on heavy trading volume that reportedly led to delays on some bitcoin exchanges. It was most recently trading at $1,108. Cameron Winklevoss, left, and brother Tyler discussing bitcoin at the SXSW Interactive Festival in 2015.Photo: Associated Press The SEC\u2019s judgment, posted in an order on the regulator\u2019s website, marks the end, for now, of a long and drawn-out odyssey to package bitcoin into an exchange-traded product that could create a broader investor base for the virtual currency. The shares would have traded under the symbol COIN on the Bats BZX Exchange, operated by\n            CBOE Holdings\n Inc.\n      . \u201cWe remain optimistic and committed to bringing COIN to market, and look forward to continuing to work with the SEC staff,\u201d said Tyler Winklevoss, the chief financial officer of Digital Asset Services, LLC. \u201cWe began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through.\u201d The SEC provided two main reasons for the denial, both related to bitcoin itself and the markets in which it trades. That could mean other proposed bitcoin products will face the same objections. Under the law, the exchange listing the bitcoin product\u2014in this case, Bats\u2014must have agreements with significant exchanges that monitor trading in the commodity. The SEC said the only agreement Bats had was with the Gemini Exchange, which trades bitcoin, and that it didn\u2019t pass muster because it isn\u2019t sufficiently regulated."]
["Markets Main", "Most bitcoin exchanges aren\u2019t regulated, and are spread across the globe from the U.S. to Europe to China. That means that Bats would simply be unable to enter into any kind of surveillance agreements with those exchanges that would satisfy the rules, the SEC said. \u201cWe agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors,\u201d Mr. Winklevoss said. Bats declined to comment. \u201cThe SEC is essentially saying that until significant bitcoin markets are regulated, the listing exchange really can\u2019t address concerns about the potential for manipulative trading,\u201d said Michael Mundt, a partner at law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young LLP who formerly regulated exchange-traded products at the SEC. The decision comes at a time when SEC officials have voiced concern about the growing complexity of some exchange-traded products and how volatile they can be during market routs. Trading in hundreds of ETPs was halted during a wild trading session on Aug. 24, 2015, when the market value of their shares diverged widely from the underlying holdings. Bats and CBOE could appeal a staff denial, and they also could rewrite the proposal based upon feedback that could make the product more acceptable to regulators. There are two other applications for similar bitcoin products on the SEC\u2019s desk, from Grayscale Investments LLC and SolidX Management LLC. The deadline on the latter, March 30, is fast approaching. Representatives from both firms declined to comment."]
["Markets Main", "Grayscale\u2019s product has an interesting wrinkle, in that it already trades publicly on an over-the-counter exchange to accredited investors. The firm is seeking to also list it on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed up 6.3% on Friday, moments before the SEC ruling was released, at $135. Former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White in a May 2016 speech said, \u201cDespite the popularity and broad success of these funds, their history is not without some turbulence,\u201d She at the time announced a task force that would focus on concerns about how some ETPs trade.

One of the most intriguing: What about Marianne Lake? JPMorgan\u2019s 48-year-old chief financial officer, Ms. Lake is one of the most senior women on Wall Street and has been on the bank\u2019s short list of possible successors for years, people familiar with its board say. January\u2019s announcement by the bank of executive moves makes her an even more likely contender."]
["Markets Main", "In one respect, Ms. Lake would be a historic choice, the first female chief executive of one of the largest U.S. banks. A single mother of three young children, Ms. Lake has already become a role model for women in finance, juggling a high-profile job and family demands. In her first year as CFO, 2013, Ms. Lake won praise for her handling of the fallout from the bank\u2019s 2012 \u201cLondon whale\u201d trading loss. She is well known to investors and analysts, a fixture on the bank\u2019s quarterly earnings calls who sometimes acts as a diplomatic foil to her outspoken boss. During one call in October, for example, Ms. Lake tempered criticism Mr. Dimon had levied on the volatile digital currency bitcoin, which he\u2019d recently called a \u201cfraud.\u201d After Mr. Dimon deflected follow-up questions, Ms. Lake gave a more measured response, saying the bank is \u201cvery open minded to the potential-use cases\u2026for digital currencies that are properly regulated.\u201d Of course, the palace intrigue about Mr. Dimon\u2019s successor is in its early days. And another female executive, Mary Callahan Erdoes,  is also a contender. Even Ms. Lake\u2019s supporters said she would have to move into another job leading a business and do well there to create the momentum that would be needed to succeed Mr. Dimon. A 19-year veteran of the bank who grew up in England, Ms. Lake has mostly\u00a0held finance-related jobs that don\u2019t produce client-driven revenue. Before her appointment as CFO, Ms. Lake led finance for the consumer banking unit and earlier was the investment bank\u2019s global controller."]
["Markets Main", "Other candidates viewed among JPMorgan insiders as possible CEOs of the largest U.S. bank by assets have run divisions that generate revenue. For example, Doug Petno,  52, is head of the bank\u2019s commercial-banking business. Ms. Erdoes, 50, leads the asset and wealth-management businesses. Ms. Erdoes was awarded $19.5 million in compensation last year, compared with $13.5 million for Ms. Lake and $12 million for Mr. Petno. Those two executives and Ms. Lake were mentioned in JPMorgan\u2019s January announcement of executive moves. Most important, the bank and its board said in the announcement that Mr. Dimon plans to stay in his role about five more years. That marked the first time the bank publicly put a timeline on what is likely to be the length of his tenure. Having become chief in late 2005, Mr. Dimon is the longest-serving CEO of the big-six U.S. banks. The announcement turned the succession race within JPMorgan\u2019s C-suite, which has produced years of jockeying by executives, into a real event. Ostensibly, the front-runners are Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto. The January announcement featured their promotion to the No. 2 role below Mr. Dimon. However, the five-year horizon given for Mr. Dimon suggests those two executives may actually be out of the running, people close to the bank said. This is because both will be 60 or older at the end of that period, an age many analysts and investors believe will likely put them out of the running."]
["Markets Main", "Ms. Lake, Mr. Petno and Ms. Erdoes, on the other hand, would be in their 50s, a more common age for a new bank CEO. At the big-six U.S. banks, the current CEOs took over when they were at or between the ages of 49 and 56. A JPMorgan spokesman said all the executives declined to comment. The elevation of Messrs. Smith and Pinto is also potentially significant for Ms. Lake in another way, according to people familiar with the matter. Those executives run the retail division and the corporate and investment bank, respectively. Ms. Lake will likely be a candidate to fill one of these spots, or to take up part of the duties of one of the positions, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Ms. Lake will again MC JPMorgan\u2019s investor day on Feb. 27 as she has done in the past. But this year that role is expected to take on added prominence, according to people familiar with the matter.

["Politics and Policy", "\u201cIf there is no longer a requirement for everyone to purchase coverage, it is critical that any legislation include strong incentives for people to obtain health insurance and keep it year-round,\u201d the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement. \u201cA system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone.\u201d Medicaid is known for providing health services to women and children, but more money is spent on the elderly and disabled. Here's how Medicaid works \u2014 and why it's being debated in Congress as part of repealing Obamacare. Photo: Getty Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers are major participants in the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges, with the biggest market share in many states. No details of the skinny-repeal plan have been released. Sources familiar with the proposal say it would end the controversial coverage requirement and a related requirement that most employers provide health insurance to their workers. It would also repeal a tax on medical devices.  But it would leave untouched major components of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law, including Medicaid expansion in 31 states, regulations that require insurers to cover people regardless of their health status and a mandate that most health plans cover a raft of specific health benefits such as maternity care. The skinny repeal idea\u2014which could come to a vote by the end of the week\u2014represents a major new tactic by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to bring some sort of repeal across the finish line. The Senate on Wednesday rejected a broader bill to repeal much of the ACA with a two-year transition period. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Health insurers have long warned about the danger of ending enforcement of the ACA\u2019s penalty for people who don\u2019t have insurance coverage without replacing the mandate with other provisions aimed at prodding young, healthy people to enroll in health plans. Without such efforts, individual insurance markets have gone into meltdowns known as \u201cdeath spirals,\u201d which are cycles of rising premiums and shrinking enrollment. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a repeal of the coverage mandate would push up premiums for individual plans by about 20%, as younger, healthier people\u2014who help offset the costs of older and sicker consumers\u2014would likely drop coverage that isn\u2019t required. The CBO has also suggested that dumping the mandate would eventually lead to 15 million fewer people insured than under the ACA. Low-income people would likely be insulated from those cost increases, since the skinny plan would leave in place subsidies that rise with the cost of insurance. But people making more than four times the poverty level would see their costs rise considerably under the plan. \u201cIf it leaves in place the premium tax credits, I think it would result in big premium increases but not a complete decimation of the individual market,\u201d said Larry Levitt,  senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cA big question is how insurers would react. I think more would exit the market, but some would stick around.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "The Blues group, in its statement, reiterated the industry\u2019s long-time call for funding of federal payments that reduce health-care costs for low-income ACA enrollees. It said \u201cdedicated funds must be provided to help pay for the care of those with significant medical conditions.\u201d The statement also said, \u201cany final legislation must include these crucial elements to avoid steep premium increases and diminished choices that would make coverage unaffordable and inaccessible.\u201d During a call with financial analysts Wednesday,\n            Anthem\n Inc.,\n      a major Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer, said if it doesn\u2019t quickly get more certainty about the future of the ACA exchanges, particularly the cost-sharing payments, it will likely further pull back its planned participation for next year. The big insurer, which has already announced it will leave the exchanges in three of the 14 states where it currently participates, said without the cost-sharing payments it will need to seek rate increases of around 18% to 20% on exchange plans, on top of significant hikes it is already seeking of 20% or more. In some markets, such large increases aren\u2019t workable and could have a cascading effect, Anthem said. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership"]

Mr. Marino had come under fire from Democrats in Congress in recent days after the Washington Post and CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reported he had helped shepherd legislation weakening DEA power over pharmaceutical companies that produce opioid drugs.

Resources under the Stafford Act are limited, and Mr. Trump has recently invoked the act\u2019s emergency measures to assist in hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico and several southern states. Use of Stafford funds for drug treatment could divert money from short-term natural-disaster recovery. A declaration under the Public Health Service Act, meanwhile, wouldn\u2019t free up additional funds, but it would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to waive certain rules and make some money available through the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.

Advocates of the move say it would help draw attention to the crisis. \u201cThis is not quite like other public health emergencies,\u201d said Marcia Lee Taylor, chief policy adviser at anti-drug group Partnership for Drug-Free Kids. \u201cThere\u2019s a bully pulpit issue here.\u201d A spokesman for HHS said the issue is under legal review.

["Technology", "The new devices are coming as the industry\u2019s boom times have faded. Brands in recent years have struggled to develop impressive new features, and consumers are holding on to their devices longer. Global sales growth has fizzled and most phone buyers stick with the brands they know, meaning Apple, Samsung and others generally have been competing for a relatively small share of consumers whose loyalties are up for grabs. \u201cThere are fewer new customers and you\u2019re having to fight to get your customers to upgrade,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst with Jackdaw Research. But in 2017, several factors are creating a rare chance to siphon away\u2014or lose\u2014consumers. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 is an ambitious effort to recover from last year\u2019s battery fiasco, which led to a $5 billion recall of three million Galaxy Note 7 phones and damaged consumer trust. \u201cThe Galaxy S8 is our testament to regaining consumers\u2019 trust by redefining what\u2019s possible in safety and marks a new milestone in Samsung\u2019s smartphone legacy,\u201d a company spokeswoman said.  Apple is recovering from a slump of its own\u2014its stock price in February regained levels not seen in two years\u2014and is aiming to overcome criticism that the iPhone 7, released last year, was but a modest improvement over its predecessor. Wall Street expects the 10th-anniversary iPhone to deliver major new features though with a price tag of $1,000, an unusually high cost that carries risks. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 will be sold for about $750, with a larger version going for $100 more."]
["Technology", "Apple declined to comment on the iPhone speculation. \u201cThis will likely be an unusually high year of switchers,\u201d said Wayne Lam, a principal analyst at market-research firm IHS Markit, partly because of the Galaxy S8\u2019s impressive design and the fact that the next iPhone won\u2019t be released until the fall.

Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese company that aspires to overtake Samsung and Apple in market share by 2021, unveiled its own new high-end phone in February.

["Technology", "In the latest evidence of the industry\u2019s challenges, Huawei said Friday its profit growth slowed last year as margins fell and it invested more money in its consumer business. Meanwhile, Apple supplier\n            Foxconn Technology\n            \n      Group posted its first-ever annual revenue decline since going public in 1991, caused by a slump in iPhone sales. In the U.S., the intense competition is occurring in a market that has become, in some ways, more rigid. A decade into the smartphone era, people are more loyal to their smartphones than nearly any other consumer product or purchase, researchers say.  Other markets are more fluid, especially in China and India where price-sensitive consumers frequently jump brands. But the U.S. is the key battleground, because Americans, on average, fork over more for top-line gadgets. Most U.S. consumers are settled either on the iPhone or on the Android system, where Samsung is the dominant player. Just 11% of Android users who bought a new device last year switched to an iPhone.

["Technology", "While those features have won some plaudits, the backdrop for Samsung is daunting: Some 37% of Samsung users in the U.S. said they were less likely to buy another Samsung smartphone after last year\u2019s recall of the Galaxy Note 7, according to a March survey conducted by Fluent LLC, a marketing technology company. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for Apple,\u201d said Jordan Cohen, chief marketing officer at Fluent.

Apple is expected to also continue offering less expensive models. Competition has led each company to boost the services it offers with its devices. Apple has emphasized its streaming music service, Apple Music, cutting exclusive deals for new albums with popular artists such as Frank Ocean. Meanwhile, Samsung invested heavily to develop Bixby, which relies on deep-learning software developed by two of Siri\u2019s creators. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about the experience beyond the brand,\u201d said Lauren Guenveur, global consumer insight director for Kantar Worldpanel.

Ms. Akombe told Kenya\u2019s \u201cThe Nation\u201d newspaper that she had confronted other members of the electoral commission about her concerns, but \u201cthis was met with more extremist responses from most commissioners, who are keen to have an election even if it is at the cost of the lives of our staff and voters.\u201d She repeated her claims in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. Ms. Akombe accused the commission of partisanship and claimed her colleagues had been compromised and intimidated, but didn\u2019t say explicitly which candidate she believed was responsible. \u201cWhen I spoke things that were uncomfortable to certain angles, I got threats, I got messages sent to me,\u201d Ms. Akombe told the BBC, without elaborating. Mr. Odinga declined to comment on Ms. Akombe\u2019s claims, saying it was \u201ca subject for another day.\u201d Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s side has maintained the vote must happen on Oct. 26 to end the uncertainty and follow the court\u2019s ruling. He\u00a0didn\u2019t comment on Ms. Akombe\u2019s allegations, but issued a statement\u00a0calling Kenyans to national prayer this weekend."]

["Asia News", "Often in a Chinese criminal investigation, someone being questioned is asked by police to remain in the city where the probe is being conducted.  The players have declined to answer questions, including on Saturday when approached by a Wall Street Journal reporter. The U.S. State Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, and White House officials said they had no comment.  The three players have been biding time in adjoining corner rooms on a club floor of the Hyatt Regency Hangzhou, with their curtains drawn and a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign illuminated at the door. The rooms feature views of ancient temples and Hangzhou\u2019s famed West Lake on a floor where a single room costs more than $400 a night. Two UCLA officials are in China with the players, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Saturday, about three hours before they had been scheduled to debut as freshmen players for UCLA, the trio was 100 miles south of the game arena, having breakfast in the Hyatt\u2019s VIP rooftop club. They were dressed casually in T-shirts and appeared in good spirits. Along with a UCLA executive accompanying them, they ignored a reporter\u2019s questions. There was no police presence. The UCLA basketball players, along with Georgia Tech\u2019s team, arrived in China last weekend to participate in marketing events on behalf of their host, the Hangzhou-based e-commerce giant\n            Alibaba Group Holding\n Ltd.\n      , which in recent years has sponsored a U.S. college game in China."]

The players remained in Hangzhou while UCLA\u2019s other players and cheerleaders went on to Shanghai, taking in its new Disneyland. Saturday\u2019s game, against Georgia Tech, the season opener, wasn\u2019t broadcast in the hotel; UCLA won 63-60.

Chinese authorities said they intend to pursue the case according to local laws but haven\u2019t commented on specifics. The investigation phase of police work in China can take weeks, concluding in a decision on whether formal arrests will be made and charges filed."]

["Credit Markets", "Bonds of Rusal were the hardest hit last week after the firm\u2019s owner, billionaire Oleg Deripaska,  was included on the list of sanctioned individuals because of his ties to Mr. Putin. The bid price of the firm\u2019s bonds due 2022, which U.S. bondholders must divest before May 7, dropped to roughly 66 cents on the dollar from 99 cents a week earlier, and the yield of the bond nearly tripled to 19.3%, according to data from Markit.

["Business", "Replicating the U.S. fracking boom elsewhere has taken on fresh urgency in an era of stubbornly low and volatile oil prices. Outmaneuvered early on in the U.S. by smaller companies, Exxon, Shell,\n            Chevron\n Corp.\n      and others see Argentina as one of their best opportunities to expand shale, which generally features projects that can be ramped up or down with prices. The Vaca Muerta has long been a focus of this sometimes quixotic quest, but a business-friendly government at all levels that is actively working to encourage drilling is fueling optimism that shale development in the region could finally begin to take off.  Hurdles still remain and costs in Argentina are significantly higher than the U.S. But this time around, the big-oil company executives are determined not to miss out, hoping to leverage their big balance sheets and experience with foreign governments to make international shale work. And they want to prove wrong critics who say they can\u2019t drill shale as well as specialists in the U.S. \u201cOur position is: Hell no! We will show that we can drill and complete wells better than the best,\u201d said Andrew Brown, Shell\u2019s head of exploration and production. \u201cWe\u2019re showing it in Argentina.\u201d This year, Exxon is expected to move from experimental pilot to proper development in the region, taking a step toward investments that former Chief Executive Rex Tillerson last year said could exceed $10 billion in the coming decades."]

["Business", "Senior drilling engineer Wouter Miedema, who has worked in shale projects in the U.S. and Canada, said he was struck by the similarities between the geology of the Vaca Muerta and the most productive shale fields of North America. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think that on the other end of the planet you\u2019ve got shale like this,\u201d he said. The expanse of iron-toned dirt into which he was drilling is thought to hold 27 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and 802 trillion cubic feet of gas embedded in a layer of shale that is up to 1,700 feet thick, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That ranks its geology up there with some of the best fields in the U.S., executives and analysts say. For now, Shell is investing under $200 million a year to see if it can make shale work in Argentina. It isn\u2019t enough to reach a level comparable with U.S. shale, though Shell executives say the region could be a big producer. Major companies like Shell were late to get in to shale production in the U.S. When they did venture in, they found the process to be different than the engineering feats that characterized other oil exploration and output.   Still, companies want to take it slow in Argentina, because they have been burned in the past. Their previous wildcatting attempts in shale from Europe to Russia and China have been stymied by a variable cocktail of poor drilling results, political opposition, regulatory hurdles and the dramatic drop in oil prices that began in 2014."]
["Business", "Argentina\u2019s shale is no sure thing. Companies have to spend more time and money figuring out the best places to drill in Argentina, where the Vaca Muerta is still relatively unexplored territory compared with the U.S. shale patch. On cost, infrastructure and manpower, it can\u2019t yet compete with the U.S. According to Shell, steel casing here costs 40% more than it does in Texas, even though it is made in Argentina. Casing accounts for up to 25% of well costs, so that price difference makes drilling here much more expensive, Shell says. In March, Exxon told analysts that it currently costs two to three times more to drill a well in the Vaca Muerta than it does in the U.S. Recent progress on costs has infused oil companies with hope about the Vaca Muerta, including agreements with local unions and a government pledge to keep natural-gas prices high. Shell\u2019s local well costs, including drilling and completion, have plummeted from about $35 million for their first well in 2012 to under $10 million now.

NASA is working with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX to redesign part of the fuel system for the company\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets and then will demand at least seven successful unmanned flights before allowing astronauts on board. Those requirements, spelled out during a House space subcommittee hearing Wednesday, highlight safety and schedule challenges confronting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s commercial crew-transportation program. With routine flights ferrying U.S. astronauts to the orbiting international space station slated to begin in fall of 2019, the agency\u2019s top outside safety watchdog has raised new questions about potential hazards in testimony to the House panel. The safety of internal helium tanks, needed to keep fuel flowing properly during ascent, has been identified as one of the most prominent unresolved risks for SpaceX. "]
["U.S. News", "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as Mr. Musk\u2019s company is called, and\n            Boeing\n Co.\n      , which is separately developing what are intended to be privately operated spacecraft, both face the \u201cvery real possibility of future schedule slips,\u201d said Patricia Sanders, who heads NASA\u2019s independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. Commenting on the likelihood that neither company will be able to fully comply with all of NASA\u2019s longstanding safety standards, Ms. Sanders said ending current U.S. reliance on Russian capsules for crew transportation may \u201crequire decisions to accept a higher risk\u201d on next-generation U.S. systems than anticipated. The hearing also disclosed that the statistical limit for a \u201cfailed mission\u201d remains approximately one in 55 launches, despite several years of intense development, NASA expenditures of about $5 billion and significant additional investment by the two companies. That limit applies to mission failures in which the vehicle doesn\u2019t reach the space station but the crew uses emergency procedures to survive. NASA\u2019s statistical standard for crew fatalities is no greater than one in 270 flights, though Ms. Sanders and NASA officials have signaled neither Boeing nor SpaceX is on track to meet that precise mandatory benchmark.

["U.S. News", "By contrast, the global airline industry has achieved fatal accident rates for jetliners of one crash for several million flights. During her testimony, Ms. Sanders also said that given the agency\u2019s expertise and history of close collaboration with the two companies, \u201cNASA will be able to make a reasonable decision\u201d to balance mitigating hazards while avoiding extensive delays. The hearing was marked by repeated lawmaker comments expressing concern about the fall 2019 deadline to start ferrying astronauts to the space station.  In his prepared opening statement, Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin, the subcommittee chairman, said, \u201cWe are here today looking at not one, but two companies that are behind schedule, may not meet safety and reliability requirements and could even slip into cost overruns.\u201d Mr. Babin added that the challenges heighten the \u201crisk that the [space station] cannot be successfully or gracefully transitioned\u201d out of service in the middle of next decade.

SpaceX\u2019s top flight-reliability official told the panel the company is working in tandem with NASA to fully understand and alleviate risks associated with the helium tanks, which have been identified as the cause of two previous accidents. William Gerstenmaier, NASA\u2019s top human-exploration official, testified that a redesign of the tanks is under way. \u201cWe will identify the most likely contributors\u201d that led to the previous catastrophic accidents, he said."]
["U.S. News", "He also said NASA is methodically assessing, but hasn\u2019t signed off on, controversial SpaceX plans to load fuel into its rockets on the launchpad, while astronauts are strapped into the capsule on top.

The rise owed largely to a 60% increase in streaming revenue, which now amounts to $3.9 billion. While label executives are relieved to see industry revenues rise, they also recognize that a single year of robust growth is hardly a guarantee that their fortunes have reversed."]
["Business", "Among other issues, Spotify and its rivals have never reported a profit. To change that, those services may need to lower the royalty rates they pay music companies like Universal. The nascent recovery \u201cdoes not erase 15 years of declines, or continuing uncertainty about the future,\u201d Cary Sherman,  CEO of the music industry\u2019s U.S. trade group, wrote in a blog post earlier this year. Mr. de Puyfontaine, however, said that Vivendi\u2019s stock is undervalued in part because it doesn\u2019t reflect the true value of the music unit. Some investment banks pitching the idea of a float value the unit at up to \u20ac20 billion ($22.5 billion), Vivendi General Counsel Frederic Crepin told shareholders last month. Analysts value the unit at closer to \u20ac13 billion. Vivendi has undergone a deep transformation in the past three years, but Mr. de Puyfontaine and Vincent Bollor\u00e9,  Vivendi\u2019s chairman and main shareholder, have yet to convince investors that the company has promising growth prospects. Two years ago, Vivendi ignored calls from an activist shareholder to unlock value by selling some or all Universal. Investors also say that floating a stake in Universal could complicate Vivendi\u2019s attempts to find synergies between its music, film and television and videogame assets. It could become a distraction, adding a regulatory burden and increasing the time that Lucian Grainge,  Universal\u2019s CEO, would have to spend on Wall Street investors\u2019 concerns.\u00a0 Mr. Bollor\u00e9 met with Mr. Grainge in California last week but didn\u2019t discuss a possible IPO, according to people familiar with the matter."]

That is despite Vivendi giving back \u20ac8 billion in cash to shareholders through special dividends and share buybacks. But Mr. de Puyfontaine is unfazed. He stressed that Vivendi has an edge on competition because of its combination of owning content, building partnerships with telecom companies to distribute that content, and having data on how its customers consume that content. \u201cWe are proving day after day that our businesses are working together, and that they are creating much greater value for Vivendi than the sum of our parts,\u201d Mr. de Puyfontaine said. \u2014Ethan Smith in Los Angeles contributed to this article.

["Historically Speaking", "The word circus is Roman, but Roman and modern circuses do not share the same roots. Rome\u2019s giant Circus Maximus, which could hold some 150,000 people, was more of a sporting arena than a theatrical venue, built to hold races, athletic competitions and executions. The Roman satirist Juvenal was alluding to the popular appeal of such spectacles when he coined the phrase \u201cbread and circuses,\u201d assailing citizens\u2019 lack of interest in politics. In fact, the entertainments commonly linked with the modern circus\u2014acrobatics, animal performances and pantomimes\u2014belong to traditions long predating the Romans. Four-millennia-old Egyptian paintings show female jugglers; in China, archaeologists have found 2,000-year-old clay figurines of tumblers.  Circus-type entertainments could be hideously violent: In 17th-century Britain, dogs tore into bears and chimpanzees. A humane change of pace came in 1768, when Philip Astley,  often called the father of the modern circus, put on his first show in London, in a simple horse-riding ring. He found that a circle 42 feet in diameter was ideal for using centrifugal force as an aid in balancing on a horse\u2019s back while doing tricks. It\u2019s a size still used today. Between the horse shows, he scheduled clowning and tumbling acts.  \n Circuses in fledgling America, with its long distances, shortage of venues and lack of large cities, found the European model too static and costly. In 1808, Hachaliah Bailey took the circus in a new direction by making animals the real stars, particularly an African elephant named Old Bet. The focus on animal spectacles became the American model, while Europeans still emphasized human performers."]
["Historically Speaking", " When railroads spread across America, circuses could ship their menageries. Already famous for his museums and \u201cfreak shows,\u201d P.T. Barnum and his partners joined forces with rivals and used special circus trains to create the largest circus in the country. Although Barnum played up the animal and human oddities in his \u201csideshow,\u201d the marquee attraction was Jumbo the Elephant. In its final year, the Ringling Bros. animal contingent, according to a news report, included tigers, camels, horses, kangaroos and snakes. The elephants had already retired. Once animal-rights protests and rising travel costs started eroding profitability in the late 20th century, the American circus became trapped by its own history. But the success of Canada\u2019s Cirque du Soleil, which since its 1984 debut has conquered the globe with its astounding acrobatics and staging, shows that the older European tradition introduced by Astley still has the power to inspire wonder. The future may well lie in looking backward, to the era when the stars of the show were the people in the ring. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.376%, above the 2.352% on Friday. Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, have trended upward in recent weeks as alarming geopolitical headlines receded into the background and investors increasingly focused on the potential for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June policy meeting. One element of uncertainty that had weighed on yields in recent months was removed on Sunday as the centrist Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France in an easy victory over the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, who had threatened to pull the country out of the eurozone. A win for Ms. Le Pen had been feared by investors but was seen as highly unlikely by the final days of the campaign, keeping the vote from having a major impact on the market."]
["Credit Markets", "Despite Mr. Macron\u2019s victory, yields on safe-haven government bonds fell modestly in the European trading session, before rising when the U.S. market opened. \u201cAt this point we\u2019re just kind of seeing some squaring up in the U.S. market\u201d with investors \u201clooking ahead to supply this week and a couple of the data points,\u201d including reports on the consumer-price index and retail sales, said John Herrmann, director of rates strategy at MUFG Securities in New York. This week\u2019s auctions kick off Tuesday with a $24 billion sale of three-year notes, followed by a $23 billion sale of 10-year notes Wednesday and a $15 billion sale of 30-year bonds Thursday. An influx of new bonds can sometimes outpace demand, causing prices on existing bonds to fall in the secondary market. Though still well below the 2.6% level it reached in December and March, the 10-year yield has been on the upswing lately, rising from a five-month low of 2.177% in mid-April. Fed officials, at a policy meeting last week, held short-term interest rates steady as widely expected, following a rate increase in March. But in a policy statement, officials said slow growth earlier this year was \u201clikely to be transitory.\u201d On Friday, new data showed the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in a decade, further bolstering confidence among investors that the Fed will act again in June. When the Fed raises short-term interest rates, it tightens money supply in the economy and tends to shrink the value of outstanding bonds."]

["U.S. News", "Locals see an opportunity for Amazon to broaden its workforce\u2014a constant struggle for tech companies\u2014by hiring from the city\u2019s largely Hispanic and black residents. The relationship, though, got off the wrong foot when Amazon proposed a workaround of a local ordinance that asks companies to hire at least 30% of its workforce from the pool of residents. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hire us. That\u2019s the message that everyone\u2019s getting,\u201d said JT Faraji, a local artist and activist who has helped organize recent protests against Amazon\u2019s plan to bypass the local hiring policy. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be creating jobs in East Palo Alto and are committed to investing in the local community,\u201d said an Amazon spokesman. Amazon has said there aren\u2019t enough people in East Palo Alto with the required skills, which range from administrative to coding. Rather than try to hire from the local population, Amazon and the developer of its new building in East Palo Alto proposed carving out a 1,500-square-foot space for a job development center\u2014located in the parking garage\u2014with a one-person staff to help residents train for and find employment. \u201cWe could have 392 jobs from Amazon but I don\u2019t know that we can fill them. Or we can have a center for the next 10 years\u201d that can train residents and help them earn a living wage, said Marie McKenzie, the administrative service director for East Palo Alto and who has been the administrator of the city\u2019s first-source hiring program since 2003. "]
["U.S. News", "The mounting tension in East Palo Alto illustrates the growing divide in Silicon Valley between companies and the neighborhoods where they set up shop. While tech companies have brought wealth and renown to their hometowns, their rapid growth has put pressure on local resources\u2014from sapping the housing supply to increasing traffic.  For years, East Palo Alto was overlooked in the tech building boom. Space to grow was plentiful in the major Silicon Valley neighborhoods such as Palo Alto and Menlo Park, but is now getting scarce. East Palo Alto is eager to ready more commercial space but has faced infrastructure obstacles like an insufficient water allocation, which has stalled development. In June, the city struck a deal to receive an additional one million gallons a day from Mountain View\u2019s allocation for $5 million. Neighboring communities\u2019 growing wealth from the presence of tech companies has helped make the contrast with East Palo Alto, where most of the 2,500 jobs are blue collar and in retail, especially pronounced. Just a few miles away, outside the city limits, are the headquarters of tech giants such as Google parent\n            Alphabet\n Inc.,\nFacebook\n Inc.\n      and\n            Tesla\n Inc.\n      The median annual household income in East Palo Alto between 2011 and 2015 was $52,012, compared with $136,519 in Palo Alto, located on the other side of the 101 highway, according to U.S. census data."]
["U.S. News", "\u201cWe represent the two sides of the American economy,\u201d said Ruben Abrica, an East Palo Alto city council member, describing the differences between East Palo Alto and Palo Alto. Rising home values in nearby Palo Alto and Menlo Park have lifted rents in East Palo Alto, forcing some longtime residents to move far away. Big box retailers including IKEA and Nordstrom Rack arrived in East Palo Alto in the past 15 years, bringing work and millions of dollars of revenue to the city, but replacing apartment complexes and an abandoned high school. East Palo Alto has had an ordinance since 2001 requiring companies put in a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to hire locally, a so-called first-source hiring policy. Similar ordinances have been tried in other cities such as Los Angeles for specific projects, and Portland for companies that receive economic-development subsidies from the city. The policy\u2019s effectiveness usually requires political leadership and strong intermediaries that can keep employers and the community informed about job prospects and hiring needs, said Greg Schrock, an associate professor of urban studies and planning at Portland State University and who has studied first-source hiring policies. Such policies tend to better cater to jobs in retail, manufacturing and construction."]
["U.S. News", "In East Palo Alto, the policy has had uneven results. IKEA,\n            Home Depot\n            \n      and\n            McDonald\u2019s\n            \n      all have more than 30% of workers from East Palo Alto. But the Four Seasons hotel doesn\u2019t meet the minimum threshold because its \u201chigh-level of customer service\u201d demands all staff from the top down to the cleaning staff to speak proficient English, according to a city report from February. Four Seasons didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Amazon, based in Seattle, has had a small office in East Palo Alto since 2014, but the company wasn\u2019t subject to the local hiring policy because the building went up before it came into effect. Amazon\u2019s new 214,000-square-foot location is expected to house its cloud-services unit, Amazon web services, and other teams when it opens in the fall. Before signing the lease in March, Amazon requested a modified version of the ordinance\u2014substituting the job center for the local hiring requirement\u2014according to city council documents. JobTrain, a nonprofit that provides educational and job training services, will run the center, which has a $1.2 million budget, according to the documents.

["U.S. News", "At a community meeting in May, some of the roughly 50 attendees shook their heads as renderings of Amazon\u2019s gleaming four-story office building, complete with glass walkways, appeared on screen. The job development center, in contrast, showed just enough room for a few tables and no windows. A recent photo of the construction site shows the planned space now has windows. Community members said they would like Amazon to create a pipeline program that could help get locals on a technology career track. East Palo Alto doesn\u2019t penalize companies that don\u2019t follow the first-source ordinance, said Mr. Abrica, the city council member, hoping instead that a good standing with the city by complying with the ordinance would be enough of an incentive. Ultimately, redevelopment and more companies coming in would be good for the city, Mr. Abrica said.

Among the dozens of companies targeted are some of the world\u2019s biggest producers and exporters of chicken and beef, including JBS SA and BRF SA."]
["World News", "Both companies have denied selling bad meat or bribing officials. Brazil\u2019s leaders fear that police allegations that meatpackers peddled rotten, salmonella-infested products could tarnish one of the country\u2019s most vibrant industries just as the economy is fighting to recover from its deepest recession on record. Brazil is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of chicken and beef, trailing only the U.S., and meat products are among its top exports. Consumers here and abroad grew concerned as the allegations made international news. \u201cWe\u2019ve been cheated if all of this is true,\u201d said Patricio Buccioni,  a 68-year-old taxi driver in Santiago who often buys Brazilian beef at the supermarket. Asked whether he will continue to do so in the future, Mr. Buccioni said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be more careful.\u201d The investigation, dubbed \u201cWeak Flesh,\u201d left Brazilian authorities walking a fine line as they sought to calm consumers and trade partners without appearing dismissive of the police\u2019s findings. The operation is the latest in a string of high-profile corruption investigations that have shaken Brazil and weakened confidence in the government. \u201cAgribusiness for us in Brazil is an extremely important thing, and it must not be devalued by a small nucleus,\u201d President Michel Temer said Monday in a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cWe export to more than 150 countries, and obviously, to reach this number, we worked for a long time.\u201d"]
["World News", "Mr. Temer has been huddling with regulators, meat producers and foreign officials to discuss the investigation and reassure them that Brazilian meat is safe.

Talking to reporters on Sunday, Mr. Maggi criticized the federal police for not clarifying some information with the ministry before releasing it to the public. For instance, police highlighted the use of meat from pigs\u2019 heads in sausages, a practice Mr. Maggi said is in fact legal in Brazil. And some meat-loving Brazilians shrugged off the concerns. \u201cYesterday, I had a barbecue with my family and friends,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Molina,  a 57-year-old advertising worker, while preparing for a meat-heavy lunch at a S\u00e3o Paulo steakhouse. \u201cI think there\u2019s exaggeration and that the situation will go back to normal soon.\u201d"]
["World News", "But governments in several of Brazil\u2019s largest export markets expressed worry, and industry officials were bracing for further restrictions. Brazil\u2019s nightmare scenario would be if foreign governments made the temporary suspensions announced Monday into more permanent bans, which could take years to overturn.  \u201cI wish, I expect, I pray that it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Maggi said in a press conference Monday after China announced the suspension of Brazilian imports.  China informed the Brazilian Agriculture Ministry on Monday that it will ban meat imports from the South American country until Brazil\u2019s government explains the situation. Mr. Maggi was scheduled to hold a videoconference with Chinese authorities on Monday night to \u201cprovide clarification,\u201d the Brazilian ministry said. China imported nearly $2 billion of meat products from Brazil last year.

South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said it wouldn\u2019t allow chicken already imported by BRF to be sold or to circulate in the country."]
["World News", "Egypt temporarily suspended imports of poultry and other meat from Brazil pending a response from the Brazilian Embassy in Cairo to questions sent by the local authorities, Agriculture Ministry spokesperson Hamed Abduldayem said. U.S. authorities are now doing more examinations of \u201craw beef trimmings and ready-to-eat product\u201d from Brazil for possible pathogens, according to the USDA. BRF said Monday that it hasn\u2019t been officially notified by foreign or domestic authorities of any suspension by countries where it does business.

["Earnings", "It is unusual for a big company, especially one such as GE that is being pressured by an activist investor to improve its performance, to ask shareholders and customers to wait so long to learn about its game plan.  \u201cThis is a strange situation,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co. \u201cThis increases the duration of the period of uncertainty.\u201d On a conference call Friday, analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets asked if GE would be in \u201climbo\u201d until November. Mr. Flannery said the financial framework for 2017 is set and that he is \u201cnot worried that we\u2019re going to be, you know, dead in the water in the meantime.\u201d Mr. Immelt will step down at the end of this month after 16 years as CEO. GE is under increasing pressure to show that its pivot away from financial services, big bets on the oil industry and a renewed focus on making jet engines and power turbines would be good for investors.

Mr. Flannery, who formerly ran GE\u2019s health-care unit, is meeting with small groups of investors and visiting the business units of the roughly 300,000-person company.   Jeffrey Bornstein,  GE\u2019s chief financial officer, defended the timeline in an interview and said the company would have to \u201cplay through\u201d any uncertainty created by a review that includes \u201ctesting everything we believe.\u201d"]
["Earnings", "\u201cThe notion that [Mr. Flannery] is going to get his arms around this in a month is a fallacy,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think asking for four or five months to do this is asking a lot.\u201d On Friday, GE backed its prior 2017 projection of earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 a share and organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, but it warned that profit would be on the weak side. \u201cGiven our outlook on oil and gas and power, we are trending to the bottom end of the range,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said on the conference call. Analysts are skeptical that GE will reach a goal of delivering $2 a share in profit in 2018, but the company said an updated target wouldn\u2019t come until after Mr. Flannery\u2019s review. \u201cThis was almost like a funeral dirge today.

Honeywell shares gained 1% to $136.35 Friday, leaving it up 18% for the year. Both GE and Honeywell are facing pressure from activist investors. GE pledged to boost its cost-cutting program earlier this year after discussions with Trian Fund Management LP, which has been frustrated by missed profit goals at GE. Third Point LLC has called on Honeywell to explore selling or splitting off its aerospace business. On Friday, GE said it cut $593 million in annual industrial costs in the second quarter and is on track to meet or beat its $1 billion savings goal by the end of the year. It has eliminated $670 million in spending this year.

["World News", "The spokesman, Lu Kang,  said the weapons transfer and other U.S. \u201cwrongdoings,\u201d including sanctions on Chinese entities, were inconsistent with progress made at the two leaders\u2019 first meeting at Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, in April. Tensions are heating up between the U.S. and North Korea after the White House announced new sanctions on Chinese entities, citing their dealings with North Korea. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why the next steps on North Korea are going to involve China as much as they involve the North Koreans themselves. Photo: AP \u201cWe hope that the U.S. administration can correct its mistakes, so that China-U.S. relations can get back on a healthy and stable track,\u201d he told a regular news briefing. The Trump administration said Thursday that it had approved the weapons sale to Taiwan\u2014first under President Trump\u2014and sanctioned four Chinese entities, including a bank it said helped Pyongyang access the U.S. financial system. The moves suggest a hardening of the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s approach to China following a gradual improvement in bilateral relations since the Mar-a-Lago summit, analysts and diplomats say. U.S. officials say they have been disappointed in the past month by China\u2019s response to their appeals for Beijing to use its economic leverage to help prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear missile capable of hitting the continental U.S.  In targeting the Bank of Dandong, the new sanctions represent an escalation in Washington\u2019s efforts to target Chinese entities that do business with North Korea."]
["World News", "Based in the city of Dandong, overlooking the Yalu River that forms the border with North Korea, the bank is one of China\u2019s smaller ones: KPMG, the accounting firm, ranked it as 124th among China\u2019s top 200 banks, based on assets, in 2015. But it serves as a key conduit for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Treasury said an estimated 17% of its transactions processed through its U.S. correspondent accounts during a three-year period involved companies that have done business with or on behalf of sanctioned North Korean entities. Emails and telephone calls to the bank went unanswered Friday. An arms sale to Taiwan was widely expected early in the Trump administration, as the U.S. is legally obliged to sell the island defensive weapons. The Obama administration approved a similar transfer in 2015. China, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, is always angered when the sales are announced and will be especially concerned this time, given Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier indications that he would pursue closer ties with Taipei. As president-elect, Mr. Trump broke with protocol in December by accepting a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. In a January interview with The Wall Street Journal, he then suggested he would review the \u201cOne China\u201d policy that requires the U.S. to forgo official recognition of Taipei."]

In the past week, however, there have been fresh signals of warming U.S. ties with Taiwan, with a U.S. Senate panel approving a bill that would allow U.S. Navy vessels to make regular port visits to the island. The U.S. moves come at a politically sensitive time for President Xi, who is presiding over celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the end of British colonial rule in Hong Kong\u2014another potential trouble spot on the Chinese periphery.

But her showing at the polls, combined with the disarray of mainstream Socialist and conservative parties, positions the vociferous critic of the European Union to take command of France\u2019s political opposition. The 48-year-old Ms. Le Pen, who blames the EU and the euro for economic and security woes in France, won 35% of the vote, according to preliminary results. That is more than the 21.3% she garnered in the first round, but significantly short of the 40% pollsters had predicted."]
["Europe News", "Speaking on Sunday night, Ms. Le Pen vowed to make her National Front the \u201cthe No. 1 opposition force\u201d to Mr. Macron and said she would work to transform the party ahead of June legislative elections. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s performance was a measure of the strength of anti-globalization sentiment in France, part of the swell of antiestablishment currents that fueled Donald Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. and Britain\u2019s referendum vote to leave the EU last year. And it showed that the appeal of her pledge to lead a \u201cpatriotic revolution\u201d to restore France\u2019s control of its borders and currency resonated with voters beyond the traditional strongholds of her once-fringe National Front. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s duel with Mr. Macron\u2014who says French people shouldn\u2019t fear globalization, but instead roll up their sleeves and embrace it\u2014showed how France\u2019s traditional left-right divide has been replaced by a new split between globalists and nationalists, and pro- and anti-EU voters. Building on her enlarged base, Ms. Le Pen could impose herself as the lead architect of a broader nationalist platform, opening her arms to both conservatives\u2014who dislike Mr. Macron\u2019s liberal social ideas, and leftist politicians\u2014who abhor the president-elect\u2019s pro-business agenda. The Socialist and conservative parties were thrown in disarray after their respective candidates were ejected from the presidential race in the April 23 first round. To consolidate a role as opposition leader, Ms. Le Pen would need to quell rebellious party voices that have challenged her incendiary rhetoric against Europe in general, and the euro in particular."]
["Europe News", "Party members such as Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen,  Ms. Le Pen\u2019s niece, have said proposing to replace the euro with a new French franc risked alienating large swaths of voters, fearful that a currency swap would hammer their savings. In the last stretch of the campaign, Ms. Le Pen said she would take time to consult the population before making any decision on the euro if she were elected. But Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen said the move may have come too late.  \u201cI think it was necessary to reassure French people,\u201d Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen told television Sunday evening. Ms. Le Pen also needs to improve the National Front\u2019s ability to convert its support into legislative seats. Voters are due to cast ballots in parliamentary elections next month. The party now has just two affiliated members in the current 577-seat National Assembly. \u201cWe need to organize ourselves differently,\u201d said Jean-Lin Lacapelle,  a senior National Front official. \u201cThe National Front has seen its limits.\u201d National Front interim leader Steeve Briois said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a real defeat tonight. It\u2019s a semi-victory.\u201d said Steeve Briois, interim leader of the National Front.  A European lawmaker, Ms. Le Pen also stands to become the flag-bearer of a nationalist wave that has swept across Europe in recent years. But her standing on the French and European scenes could suffer depending on the outcome of a French investigation into whether she misused EU funds."]
["Europe News", "French authorities suspect Ms. Le Pen cut checks to senior party officials using funds earmarked for European parliamentary assistants, according to French prosecutors. Ms. Le Pen has dismissed the allegations. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s showing Sunday is also a gauge of what progress she has made in a six-year drive to transform the National Front\u2014a protest party known for its anti-Semitic rhetoric when it was led by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from 1972 to 2011\u2014into a major political force. When Mr. Le Pen reached the second round of presidential elections in 2002, French voters determined to keep him out of office rallied behind the conservative Jacques Chirac,  who won with 82% of the vote. Most mainstream leaders sought to form a similar coalition ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote, urging voters to block Ms. Le Pen by supporting Mr. Macron, even if they disagreed with his proposed policies.

Emerging from a closed-door House GOP conference meeting, most Republicans said that they expected to vote for the tax legislation, which calls for deep cuts in corporate rates, a collapse in individual tax brackets to four from seven, and the eventual repeal of the estate tax."]
["Politics and Policy", "Among the biggest outstanding worries was whether Mr. Trump would criticize their plan, as he did during a health-care fight earlier this year, and whether Senate Republicans would be able to pass tax legislation and avoid a repeat of the tensions that doomed their health-care bill. \u201cWe just want to know if we\u2019re headed for the same rocks for being the first kid to go to the blackboard to try to spell the word,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei (R., Nev.), who has told House Republican leaders that he is still undecided. \u201cAfter the experience with health care, when we were first to go, it\u2019s not that our product was perfect but it was like, you get absolutely shredded by the folks on the other side of the building, and even some of the president\u2019s comments.\u201d The House is expected to vote on its tax bill\u00a0on Thursday, while the Senate is expected to vote on its\u00a0version\u00a0the week after Thanksgiving. In the House, Republicans can lose no more than 22 votes if they are to pass the bill without the support of Democrats, who have remained unified against the bill. The math is even harder in the Senate, where Republicans control 52 seats and need 50 votes for passage. Republicans want to deliver Mr. Trump a major legislative victory in order to have something to show for the first year of all-GOP control of Congress and the White House in a decade. But memories are long on Capitol Hill, where Republicans remember that in June, Mr. Trump told Senate Republicans that a House GOP health plan was \u201cmean\u201d and that Mr. Trump made similar disparaging remarks about the House GOP tax plan to Senate Democrats earlier this month."]
["Politics and Policy", "\n\u2018I can\u2019t go home and tell my constituents I voted to give them a tax increase.\u2019\n The question of whether the White House would be a reliable partner came up late\u00a0Monday\u00a0night in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican whip team, which is responsible for rounding up votes. House Republicans pressed White House economic adviser Gary Cohn,  who attended the meeting, about whether he told Senate Democrats at a\u00a0recent meeting that they would prefer the Senate bill over the House bill, according to Mr. Amodei. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t say it,\u201d said Mr. Amodei, who expects Mr. Trump to be asked a similar question when the president visits House Republicans\u00a0on Thursday. A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Cohn had explained that he wasn\u2019t saying that the House bill didn\u2019t matter; he was telling Senate Democrats not to allow their opinions of the House bill, which they wouldn\u2019t be voting on, to get in the way of their attitudes toward the Senate bill.  Working to tamp down on Republican fears that there was distance between the White House and Congress on the tax overhaul, House Republican leaders showed the GOP conference a Monday tweet from Mr. Trump in which the president said that he was \u201cexcited to be heading home to see the House pass a GREAT Tax Bill,\u201d one lawmaker said. \u201cThe president is on board with this and back during the health-care business it wasn\u2019t quite the same,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin (R., Texas), who plans to vote for the House tax bill."]
["Politics and Policy", "But at the same time that they were working to show unity, Republican leaders also had to contend with a matter that Mr. Trump has stirred up by insisting that Congress, as part of its tax bill, repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, a requirement that individuals have health insurance or pay a penalty. \n Senate Republicans met behind closed doors on Tuesday to discuss adding that repeal to their tax bill. Repealing the mandate would raise $338 billion over a decade because fewer people would be insured and the government would spend less on Medicaid and health-insurance subsidies. Mr. Trump wants to use the money to pay for lowering the top income rate to 35% from 39.6%. But it would introduce the messy politics of health care into tax policy. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing this bill as we have it,\u201d ahead of a vote expected\u00a0Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) told reporters. He said there would still be opportunities to tweak the tax bill when the House and Senate try to merge their different versions of the bill. \u201cThis is a work in progress.\u201d Beyond the question of trust in the White House, the House bill\u2019s path to passage is complicated by the fact that some individuals would pay more taxes under the GOP bills. Most taxpayers are likely to see lower tax bills under the Republican plan, but millions are at risk of higher taxes immediately, with the number losing out growing over time, according to analyses by Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation."]
["Politics and Policy", "Among the individual taxpayers who are most nervous are those with high medical expenses, which could no longer be deducted under the House GOP plan, and taxpayers from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and Illinois who would lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes and would see their property-tax deduction capped at $10,000. \u201cIs it real tax relief for them? I just want to see proof of it,\u201d said Rep. Randy Hultgren (R., Ill.), who said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0he had been glad to see the adoption tax credit restored, but that he was undecided on the bill while he crunched the numbers to see how it would affect middle-income families in his district. One bloc of Republican lawmakers that is likely to vote against the tax bill are those from high-tax areas of New York and New Jersey. Republicans from those states met late\u00a0Monday\u00a0with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and other GOP leaders. \u201cI think they\u2019re really trying,\u201d said Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R., N.J.), who nonetheless plans to vote no. \u201cI can\u2019t go home and tell my constituents I voted to give them a tax increase.\u201d  Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com  \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Mr. Levandowski\u2019s involvement with the project, called Kitty Hawk Corp., is another sign of his unusual tenure at Google. Over nine years at Google, Mr. Levandowski started outside firms related to his work on self-driving cars and other projects at Google, and eventually sold one to his employer for about $20 million, The Wall Street Journal reported in May. "]
["Technology", "His departure from Google sparked the high-stakes legal fight between Uber and Google parent\nAlphabet\n Inc.\n      Alphabet is suing Uber for allegedly conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its driverless-car trade secrets. Alphabet also has filed two arbitration claims against Mr. Levandowski. Kitty Hawk, launched by Alphabet Chief Executive Mr. Page, is a private, outside firm building a one-person electric aircraft that resembles a large consumer drone. While employed at Google, Mr. Levandowski worked on Mr. Page\u2019s project, though he wasn\u2019t a formal Kitty Hawk employee, according to the people. At one point, Mr. Levandowski helped test the aircraft at a ranch owned by Mr. Page while Mr. Page was present, one person said. Mr. Page confirmed Mr. Levandowski\u2019s involvement in Kitty Hawk in a nearly five-hour deposition with Uber attorneys last month, one person said.  Alphabet, Uber and Kitty Hawk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Through his attorneys, Mr. Levandowski didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Levandowski\u2019s work on Kitty Hawk reflects how highly he was regarded by Alphabet\u2019s top executives\u2014and how his side dealings weren\u2019t entirely out of place at Alphabet, where even the CEO launched outside businesses that could overlap with Alphabet\u2019s work. Alphabet\u2019s research lab has investigated a variety of aviation projects, including drones and airships. Independently of that, Mr. Page has two flying-car startups, and Google\u2019s other co-founder, Sergey Brin,  is privately funding an airship. "]
["Technology", "Still, Mr. Page said he discouraged Mr. Levandowski, a top manager on Google\u2019s self-driving car project, from starting competing firms while at Google, according to a transcript of his deposition released Wednesday. When Mr. Levandowski told Mr. Page he was considering starting a firm to develop self-driving trucks, Mr. Page said, \u201cI told him very, very clearly that I thought that was highly competitive and not a good idea,\u201d according to the transcript. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not fine. Like, that\u2019s the same thing as what you\u2019re doing here.\u2019 I mean, you can do that, but we are not going to be happy.\u2019\u201d Mr. Page added, \u201cI now believe he was trying to get me to say that it would not be competitive if he did trucking, because he was already doing it.\u201d In January 2016, Mr. Levandowski registered a driverless-truck firm, Ottomotto LLC, and quit Google days later. Alphabet accuses him of taking 14,000 confidential files with him, part of an alleged plan with Uber to steal its trade secrets.  Last August, Uber bought Ottomotto for $680 million in stock and hired Mr. Levandowski to head its self-driving project. Uber has said it had no involvement in any alleged theft and that it has developed its self-driving cars using its own technology. Alphabet sued Uber in February, and a jury trial is set for October. Mr. Levandowski, who is no longer at Uber, has declined to comment throughout the case, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights."]
["Technology", "In the deposition, Uber attorneys asked about a Google policy that allows employees to spend 20% of their time working on internal projects of their choosing. \u201cDo you think that (Mr. Levandowski) worked on projects, such as yours?\u201d an Uber attorney asked Mr. Page, apparently referring to Kitty Hawk. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the point of the 20 percent. The 20 percent\u2014it says to benefit Google. So, I mean, that\u2019s just a different thing,\u201d Mr. Page responded, according to the transcript. Kitty Hawk was discussed several times during Mr. Page\u2019s deposition, including Mr. Levandowski\u2019s involvement in it, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Page said Mr. Levandowski worked on a project that conducted testing at a ranch Mr. Page owned. Amid redactions in the transcript that hide the next several minutes of conversation, Mr. Page appears to refer to the chief executive of Kitty Hawk when he says, \u201cHe was the CEO of Udacity.\u201d Mr. Page founded Kitty Hawk in July 2015 with Sebastian Thrun,  the current CEO of Udacity, an online university, who helped launch Google\u2019s driverless-car team with Mr. Levandowski when he was a Google executive. At another point, an Uber attorney suggested that when Mr. Levandowski left Google, he told a company human-resources employee that he planned to start a driverless-truck company or join Kitty Hawk. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d Mr. Page said.

Executives at the nation\u2019s largest supermarket chain by sales warned that deflation in food prices could persist into next year. Kroger reported forecast-beating second quarter profits but cut its full-year guidance, citing year-over-year price reductions in core food commodities and employee pension obligations. The company lowered its forecast for full-year same-store sales growth excluding fuel\u2014a key metric for retailers\u2014to a range of 1.4% to 1.8%. That is down from its prior range of 2.5% to 3.5%, and compares with the average 5% growth over the past two years. Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said Kroger would continue to execute its current strategy of offering promotions where it saw fit, and didn\u2019t promise to go further in slashing prices in response to competitors to maintain store traffic."]
["Earnings", "Executives said the company has still seen growth in the total volume of goods it is selling, and customers continue to snap up high-end products such as wine and gourmet cheese. \u201cWe don\u2019t always necessarily just react to what particular competitors are doing,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Michael Schlotman said on a call with analysts.

Kroger shares were recently up 0.8% at $31.55, with other grocers suffering larger declines than the broader market. Rival grocers have handled deflationary pressures by passing along discounts to consumers to stay competitive. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. has slashed prices on items in select markets this year, putting more pressure on Kroger to respond.

["Economic Data", "The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, matching the lowest level since December 2000 for the third straight month, with benefits hitting a widening swath of the population. The unemployment rate for blacks fell to 6.8% in December, the lowest level since records were kept starting in 1972. Unemployment for Hispanics and Latinos was 4.9%, just above a record low. Those rates remained elevated relative to December\u2019s 3.7% unemployment rate for whites. Hiring has now risen for 87 straight months, the longest uninterrupted period of job expansion on record. The second longest run of job expansion\u2014between 1986 and 1990\u2014was only about half as long. The current labor-market expansion is more notable for its length than its strength. Payrolls grew by better than 2.5% annually, on average, during the economic expansions in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. Payroll growth has topped 2% for the year only once in the current upturn, in 2014. It was 1.4% in 2017, the smallest annual increase since 2010.  Still the economy could get an additional boost in the months ahead as business and individual income tax cuts passed by Congress go into effect. The cuts could stimulate consumer spending and business investment. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the economy to add another 2 million jobs in 2018, which would be a record-setting eighth straight year of job growth at or above that pace."]
["Economic Data", "\u201cThe fact that job growth hasn\u2019t tapered off faster\u2014that\u2019s pretty impressive,\u201d said Kate Warne, economist and investment strategist at Edward Jones. \u201cJob growth last year was pretty much the same as in 2016, and that\u2019s our outlook for this year as well. We don\u2019t expect anything radically different.\u201d Friday\u2019s report showed employers added jobs in manufacturing, construction and health care in December. Employment fell in retail. In theory, wage growth should be picking up as available workers become more scarce and businesses compete for labor. But average hourly earnings rose 2.5% in December from a year earlier, a similar, modest pace as maintained since early 2015. Wage gains look a bit better on a weekly basis, because Americans are working more hours. Modest wage growth is one factor that is expected to keep the Federal Reserve restrained as it raises short-term interest rates in the months ahead. It is projected to raise rates three times this year, the next time in March. As the expansion rolls on, companies are reporting increasing trouble finding qualified workers. That could spur wage gains in the months ahead as employers bid to take up and retain employees. Famous Toastery, a North Carolina chain of breakfast restaurants, wants to add two restaurants a month over the next year. The biggest threat to that goal is being able to find workers, said Chief Executive Robert Maynard. \u201cIf we need 50 people to open a restaurant, we hire 75,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know on day one, X number of people won\u2019t show up and X number of people won\u2019t be qualified.\u201d"]
["Economic Data", "He said workers frequently jump to better paying jobs, sometimes even before they start working at Famous Toastery. Still, the chain is reluctant to get into bidding wars with competitors over wages. Instead it is trying to attract workers with other perks, such as no evening work and consecutive days off for managers. The share of Americans participating in the labor force held steady at 62.7% in December. Participation has largely moved sideways the past two years, a sign that some Americans are being drawn off the sidelines of the labor market and countering the long-run trend of aging baby boomers retiring. Christopher Davis, 36 years old, lost his job as a contractor for the city of Chicago in 2014 when he plead guilty to a gun possession charge. After he was released from jail in 2015, he landed several interviews, but had job offers pulled after background checks.

The problem is how he judges victory. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a country where we actually have a surplus of trade as opposed to a deficit,\u201d Mr. Trump groused last month. If bilateral deficits are the marker he\u2019s using to make America great, Mr. Trump has set his team up to fail. It\u2019s a deeply flawed gauge of trade behavior that could lead the U.S. to pick the wrong fights."]
["Capital Account", "The U.S. has a trade deficit because it consumes more than it produces. Lacking sufficient savings, the U.S. sells assets such as stocks, bonds or other IOUs to foreigners to finance consumption and capital spending. A trade deficit always equals an inflow of foreign capital. This deficit arithmetic isn\u2019t controversial; the dispute is over what causes it. Mr. Trump and Peter Navarro, director of his National Trade Council, blame unfair trade, arguing that other countries are cheating in the global trade arena. His critics say it\u2019s the appeal of the U.S. as a destination for investment. Both arguments are an oversimplification. Trade deficits and capital inflows result from a combination of U.S. and foreign saving, consumption,\u00a0and investment behavior, much of it benign but some of it not. Mr. Trump\u2019s argument implies there should be some correlation between protectionist barriers and the trade balance. There isn\u2019t. Brazil and India are highly protectionist yet run persistent trade deficits because they save less than they\u00a0invest. Conversely, Germany, and Switzerland have low tariffs yet run persistent trade surpluses because of their high saving relative to investment. In an upcoming book, Joseph Gagnon and Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics studied 125 countries and found that between 2003 and 2014, those with higher tariffs generally had bigger current account deficits or smaller surpluses than others. (The current account includes goods and services trade and income such as interest and dividends.) They couldn\u2019t find any statistically meaningful link between the two. Some trade barriers don\u2019t appear as tariffs, such as local content requirements, but that doesn\u2019t appear to alter the overall relationship."]
["Capital Account", "The reason is that exchange rates adjust. If the U.S. imposed an across-the-board tariff, it would tend to reduce demand for foreign currency, strengthening the dollar,\u00a0making imports cheaper and exports more expensive\u00a0and canceling out the effects of the tariff. If it imposed tariffs on just one country, that country\u2019s currency would fall. Its exports would be diverted to other countries, as would U.S. imports. The U.S. bilateral deficit might change; the overall deficit much less, if at all. But this isn\u2019t to say that unfair trade practices don\u2019t matter. When another country subsidizes its exports and restricts imports, it benefits American consumers at the expense of\u00a0domestic factory workers. U.S. imports of foreign goods or acquisitions of U.S. firms by foreign companies can cost the U.S. know-how, intellectual property and future high-wage jobs. A study by David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and four others found that U.S. firms hit hardest by competition with Chinese imports reduce not just employment but also patents and research and development.\u00a0 These are all legitimate concerns for policy makers; yet fixing them won\u2019t necessarily correct the overall deficit. In the 1980s voluntary export restraints on Japan helped create a thriving auto transplant sector, but the U.S. trade deficit still grew. Persistent trade deficits usually reflect structural factors. The U.S. is virtually forced to run a trade deficit because safe-haven demand for its securities\u00a0boosts\u00a0both the dollar and capital inflows. Japan\u2019s high-saving workers fueled its trade surplus; as those workers have retired and spent their savings, the surplus has disappeared."]
["Capital Account", "Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. trade representative, signaled in congressional testimony this week that he appreciates some of these nuances. \u201cWhen I look at deficits, I try to ask myself, \u2018What does it tell me about the rules of trade?\u2019\u201d he told Congress. \u201cOur objective is not just to get the trade deficit down. Our objective is to get more efficiency in the market, is to get rid of trade barriers everywhere.\u201d The Trump team is correct in believing that sometimes trade imbalances reflect government tampering, though in the capital markets. Messrs. Gagnon and Bergsten found that countries who buy foreign currency to suppress the value of their own tend to have larger trade surpluses. In the past Chinese currency intervention and tight controls on capital inflows kept the yuan artificially cheap and its trade surpluses inflated. Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations says Taiwan and South Korea have held down their currencies via currency intervention and by encouraging domestic investors to buy foreign assets and discouraging foreign investors from buying domestic assets. These actions are legitimate cause for complaint. Yet finding an effective deterrent has eluded previous presidents and it\u2019s not clear what Mr. Trump can do differently. Punishing China for manipulating its currency makes less sense now that China is trying to prop it up, rather than push it down as in the past."]
["Capital Account", "Mr. Trump might use deficits to pick the wrong fights. Mexico runs a trade surplus with the U.S. Mr. Trump seems determined to fix it by renegotiating the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement and slapping tariffs on companies that outsource production to Mexico. But Mexico runs a trade deficit with the world as a whole. The U.S. would be attacking a country that on net is reducing the world\u2019s excess of saving, not contributing to it. If the economic and diplomatic damage weren\u2019t enough, that\u2019s one more reason for the president to be careful about how he picks his battles.

Hours after Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ruling party deputies submitted the legislation that would fundamentally reshape this North Atlantic Treaty Organization member\u2019s democracy, twin suicide bombings ripped through central Istanbul, killing at least 38 civilians and policemen. Kurdish insurgents claimed the attack targeting Turkish security forces. "]
["Middle East News", "\u201cWhenever Turkey takes a positive step for the future, we are immediately faced with a response of blood, lives, violence, chaos\u2014delivered by terrorist organizations,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said after the attacks, suggesting a correlation between them and the proposed constitutional amendments.  The bill before parliament, essentially a referendum on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rule, threatens to deepen political cleavages that have all but destroyed the ability to rule Turkey through consensus\u2014even as the country faces myriad other critical threats. These include fears of a prolonged economic slump, a counterterrorism fight both at home and across its borders\u2014as well as the fallout from the failed coup this summer.  Mr. Erdogan has been ruling by decree under a state of emergency since July, and over the last four months tens of thousands of Turks have been arrested and purged from their state jobs as alleged national security threats. A sizable number of those detained include political opponents and lawmakers.  In this politically fraught climate, the president pushed swiftly to secure one of his most cherished legislative goals: a plan to endow his currently ceremonial office with executive powers similar to those in the U.S. and Russia.  To achieve this, senior ruling party leaders, including Prime Minister Binali Yildirim,  held secret negotiations with a small group from the nationalist opposition bloc. Together they hashed out Saturday\u2019s 21-article draft bill, legislation that represents one of most substantial efforts to restructure the state since Turkey\u2019s transition to a secular republic from the Ottoman Empire almost a century ago. "]
["Middle East News", "The bill calls for Turkey\u2019s president to run his own cabinet and acquire executive powers currently vested in the parliamentary government. The changes give the head of state sweeping powers to govern by decree, and could potentially allow Mr. Erdogan to rule for two, five-year terms until 2029. People close to the president say the changes would bring stability for Turkey\u2019s most popular politician. \u201cThis would put Erdogan\u2019s mind at ease. For the past two years, he was concerned about a leadership struggle, a loss of power,\u201d said a government official. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good, it\u2019ll bring relief.\u201d The constitutional changes must pass a vote in parliament and then a national referendum, likely held this spring, before coming to effect in 2019.  The proposals face stiff resistance at this first stage from the two biggest opposition blocs in the 550-member parliament. Secularist and pro-Kurdish lawmakers slammed the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, and nationalists for seeking to impose an autocratic regime in the wake of the failed putsch.  \u201cJust like we stood against the coup attempt, we will also fight against this arbitrary, authoritarian understanding,\u201d said Levent Gok,  parliamentary whip of the main-opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, after the AKP introduced its proposal. \u201cThis will further polarize Turkey.\u201d  The ruling AKP is 14 lawmakers short of the 330 votes needed to adopt the legislation and put it to a referendum. It is counting on the 39 Nationalist Movement Party, or MHP, deputies to adopt the changes. But nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli could face defections amid an intraparty upheaval. "]
["Middle East News", "Within the AKP and MHP, some lawmakers have criticized the top-heavy way the legislation was negotiated. Many lawmakers, as well as government officials, said they had little input in the process, while officials from the president\u2019s office were heavily involved, according to people familiar with the talks.  Some nationalist lawmakers accused their leader of being beholden to Mr. Erdogan, whom they believe helped Mr. Bahceli beat back a leadership revolt this summer. The MHP and the president\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  \u201cTurkey is going through a very heavy crisis,\u201d said Umit Ozdag,  who became an independent lawmaker after the MHP leadership ousted him for mounting an opposition challenge to the long-reigning chairman. \u201cIn such times, national unity is more important than ever for Turkey\u2019s future\u2026but this government is trying to put the presidential system for Erdogan\u2014the most divisive issue in Turkey\u2014to a referendum.\u201d  In a late-November survey by Turkish pollster A&G, 45.7% of the participants said they supported a presidential system, while 41.6% opposed it and 12.7% were undecided. The margin of error wasn\u2019t publicly available, but poll results showed the yes vote rising from 37.4% in June as the share of undecided dropped from 20.1% and the no vote declined from 42.5%.  Should the amendments clear parliament, most observers say Mr. Erdogan, whose popularity rating in local surveys ranges from 50% to 55%, would secure a referendum victory. Mr. Erdogan has won all nine elections and both referendums he contested since 2002. "]
["Middle East News", "Mounting risks to Turkey\u2019s safety may also strengthen the president\u2019s hand in pressuring nationalist lawmakers to support his push and boosting the yes vote in a potential referendum.  \u201cThe Saturday night bombings will be used along with other contemporary realities to make the case that Erdogan should be armed with full formal executive powers to effectively combat terrorism and other subversive forces in Turkey,\u201d said Anthony Skinner,  an analyst covering Turkey at U.K.-based risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. \u201cWe know how much experience Erdogan has in gauging the public mood.

["Technology", "A year later, Foxconn\u2019s billionaire chairman Terry Gou said the iPhone factory complex had 100,000 workers. Today, Foxconn says it employs about 250,000, roughly the population of Madison, Wis. Analysts estimate that Foxconn, formally known as\n            Hon Hai Precision Industry\n Co.\n      , makes 150 million iPhones each year, along with 20 million iPads and other electronics. Foxconn said it employs 1 million people across China and elsewhere, including southern Shenzhen, where it began manufacturing the first iPhone amid great secrecy. With Apple embracing outsourced manufacturing in Chinese cities, the iPhone\u2019s success in the decade since it launched has fueled China\u2019s rise at the center of the global electronics supply chain.  The explosion of higher-tech manufacturing was encouraged by Beijing as leaders sought to move factories up the value chain from making plastic toys and clothes. That shift transformed the lives of millions of Chinese, bringing welcome jobs but also leading to complaints from some workers of repetitive labor, restrictive work rules and crowded living conditions in company housing. The iPhone\u2019s global success has increased scrutiny of Apple and its suppliers. The Cupertino, Calif., company said it holds Foxconn and others \u201cto the strictest standards in the industry.\u201d It said it has educated 12 million workers on their rights, ensured workweeks don\u2019t exceed 48 hours, and offered career- and personal-development courses. \u201cWe hold our suppliers to the standard we hold ourselves: They must treat everyone with dignity and respect,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. Apple said wages and working conditions at its suppliers have improved significantly in the past five years."]
["Technology", "The move to Zhengzhou followed a spate of suicides in 2010 at Foxconn\u2019s other primary iPhone production facility in Shenzhen, along the coast where wages were higher. Foxconn said in response to questions from The Wall Street Journal that many factors were behind choosing Zhengzhou, including the proximity to workers\u2019 hometowns, and suitable infrastructure and transportation.  \u201cZhengzhou\u2019s pro-business policies and the investment the government continues to make to build strong infrastructure to support manufacturing make the province an attractive location for our operations,\u201d Foxconn said in a statement. Like American company towns a century ago\u2014Pullman, Ill., Hershey, Pa., and Henry Ford\u2019s Detroit\u2014iPhone City revolves mainly around a single product, and it largely depends on that product for its wealth. On the iPhone\u2019s 10th birthday, former Apple executives Scott Forstall, Tony Fadell and Greg Christie recount the arduous process of turning Steve Jobs\u2019s vision into one of the best-selling products ever made. In iPhone City, shopping malls, restaurants and karaoke parlors, some started by former Foxconn workers, sprouted to cater to the Foxconn workforce. Government statistics indicate that exports of electronics have skyrocketed from Henan, a poor province of 94 million people with Zhengzhou at its heart. Officials had welcomed the iPhone: China\u2019s top leaders greenlighted a national-level special trade zone, and the province threw its resources into constructing and populating what would become iPhone City. During last fall\u2019s rush to make the iPhone 7, when Foxconn was short-handed, state-owned coal companies lent workers to Foxconn. In past years, according to government notices online, the province issued quotas to local authorities stating how many workers they needed to produce for Foxconn. "]
["Technology", "Readying for a production surge to make the next iPhone model, due this fall, recruiters recently visited villages to put up posters and find workers. \u201cWhile the government has provided assistance in helping us with our recruitment requirements, the costs associated with hiring and training new workers are all covered by Foxconn,\u201d the company said. On a recent June day, a speaker blared outside the factory gate: \u201cWe\u2019re recruiting the cream of society. Your personality must be optimistic, your work diligent.\u201d Foxconn workers earn some 1,900 yuan ($278) in quiet months to more than 4,000 yuan with overtime when production ramps up. Their income isn\u2019t high, but many are better off than they were as rural villagers. For the workers, the iPhone is an expensive choice, and many say they buy cheaper, Chinese-branded smartphones instead. Yuan Yanling, 28 years old, said she has worked three stints on iPhone assembly lines, quitting each time better-paid or more fun jobs appeared. Last November she traded in her Foxconn uniform for heels and began selling cosmetics in a nearby mall. \u201cOur customers are virtually all Foxconn workers,\u201d said Ms. Yuan, who lives with her husband, a Foxconn employee, and two children in a rented one-room apartment. Some of Ms. Yuan\u2019s neighbors in the apartment complex are less content than she, with some who relocated during development complaining about inadequate land compensation. Zhengzhou authorities said their land compensation was based on national standards."]
["Technology", "In 2013, one farmer, Xiao Malai, rankled local government officials by protesting his home\u2019s demolition for a development inside the industrial park anchored by Foxconn\u2019s factories, according to court documents from the trial of an official who allegedly paid an industrial park employee and other villagers to beat the farmer. Mr. Xiao died as a result of the beating, and the official, the industrial park employee and others were jailed over his death. \u201cWe were not aware of the tragic death of Xiao Malai or the circumstances of his death,\u201d an Apple spokesman said.  Other local farmers say the compensation paid for their land was more than they could ever earn in a lifetime cultivating wheat and corn. Mr. Zhang, who saw the markers drop from the helicopters in 2010, used part of his payout to buy two apartments. He said he earned more as a street sweeper than he did on the farm. His wife works at Foxconn, and their son also has. Yet unease abounds in Zhengzhou over how long Foxconn\u2014or Apple\u2014will need iPhone City. Sales of the iPhone declined last year for the first time since its debut in 2007. During last year\u2019s production downturn, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang asked Mr. Gou whether iPhone production would rise or fall this year, according to people present at the meeting. Foxconn said it has acquired 80% of the buildings it uses in Zhengzhou, leasing the remainder, and will continue to invest there."]

WHAT TO WATCH: "]
["Technology", " CLICKS AND CLICK COSTS: Google lives on the clicks on its ads, and despite nearly 20 years in business, those clicks keep growing at a healthy clip. In the third quarter, ad clicks increased 47% over the prior year. Analysts polled by FactSet forecast a 42% increase in the fourth quarter. That growth, however, has been fueled by clicks on search ads on smartphones and ads before YouTube videos, which fetch less revenue per click than search ads on traditional computers. In turn, Google\u2019s earnings per click\u2014called cost-per-click in its financial data\u2014 have steadily fallen. In the third quarter, Google said cost-per-click decreased 18% from the prior year. Analysts estimate cost-per-click will show a slower decline in the fourth quarter, with a 14% decrease, which may signal advertisers are willing to pay more for mobile search and YouTube ads. A bigger decline in cost-per-click would likely pressure margins, unless there is a commensurate increase in clicks.  TAC: Google made its search engine dominant by ensuring it is front and center on the world\u2019s smartphones and internet browsers. That is easy to accomplish on the browser and smartphone software Google created \u2014Chrome and Android\u2014but for third-party products, it needs to pay partners for the real estate. Those payments are called traffic-acquisition costs, or TAC, and the biggest recipient is typically\n            Apple\n Inc.,\n      which in turn makes Google the default search engine on iPhones. TAC has increased steadily as a percentage of revenue in recent quarters, pressuring margins. Analysts estimate TAC will increase about 29% to $6.27 billion in the quarter from a year prior. Analysts have attributed some of the recent increases to pricier contracts with Apple. They also warn recent regulations in Europe could further boost TAC by forcing Google to pay Android phone makers to promote its search engine and other services."]

Whereas the U.S. president has forged an improbable bromance with his French counterpart, his relationship with the German chancellor is more strained. Mr. Trump has in the past been highly critical of Ms. Merkel\u2019s immigration policy as well as Germany\u2019s relatively low defense spending and its trade surplus, which some in the administration have identified as evidence of a deeply unbalanced trading relationship."]
["Europe File", "With Mr. Trump yet to decide whether to make the European Union\u2019s current temporary\u00a0exemption from tariffs on imported metals permanent before it expires on May 1, Ms. Merkel can expect the EU\u2019s allegedly unfair trade practices to be firmly on the agenda. Of course, Mr. Trump is hardly the first to draw attention to Germany\u2019s vast current account surplus, which peaked at 8.6% of gross domestic product in 2015 and which in dollar terms is almost as large as the Chinese and Japanese surpluses combined. But he is the first to suggest it might reflect unfair trade practices. On the face of it, the suggestion makes no sense. Germany is bound by the same trade policies as the whole of the EU\u2014and until recently, EU trade with the U.S. was more or less balanced, with some EU countries running trade deficits, not least the U.K. Indeed, Germany itself ran a current-account deficit for the first 15 years after reunification as the country absorbed the cost of integrating East Germany; as recently as 2005, the surplus was only 4.6%. There has been no lurch toward EU protectionism since then that can explain the recent growth of the surplus. Mr. Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Tuesday.Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Instead, Germany\u2019s surplus reflects macroeconomic choices. A country\u2019s balance of payments is the difference between its overall spending and saving. Germans have chosen in aggregate to save more than they spend\u2014and export surplus capital to be invested overseas."]
["Europe File", "A number of structural factors help explain this preference for saving. The most important is acute demographic pressures which have led aging baby boomers to prioritize saving for their retirement and encouraged German firms to invest in more promising overseas markets. At the same time, the German government has been running fiscal surpluses to comply with eurozone rules and build up buffers for a future downturn.\u00a0The German corporate sector has also played its part, holding down wages for many years in a bid to regain the competitiveness that it had lost following reunification, which has helped fuel an export boom. The conventional criticism of Germany by many economists and international organizations is that by saving so much more than it spends, Germany is sucking demand out of the global economy when it should be helping to boost demand, not least in the eurozone. But this criticism has always seemed misplaced. After all, German investment elsewhere, not least in the eurozone, contributes to demand, which is one reason why the eurozone current account surplus is much lower at 3.5%. Germany\u2019s surplus has also been boosted by temporary factors including cheap oil and a weak euro, that should unwind as global growth picks up and monetary policy is normalized. Some of the structural factors will soon unwind too: wages are now rising and the baby boomers should switch from saving to spending starting in about 2025, reckons Holger Schmieding,  chief economist at Berenberg Bank."]
["Europe File", "Besides, Germany\u2019s surplus also reflects the policy choices of other countries. Mr. Trump\u2019s new tax law, for example, will boost spending and therefore likely increase the U.S. trade deficit with Germany and the EU. Nor are there any trade concessions that the EU could offer Mr. Trump that would reduce Germany\u2019s surplus since changes in trading arrangements are unlikely to make any difference to overall spending and saving preferences on either side of the Atlantic. Mr. Trump has complained in the past about EU tariffs on cars, which are higher than those in the U.S., and about EU rules on animal welfare which make it difficult for U.S. farmers to access EU markets. \u201cBut unless you can construct a story whereby German consumer spending goes up simply because they can now buy American chlorine-washed chickens, then lowering barriers won\u2019t improve the trade balance at all,\u201d says Dr. Peter Holmes,  reader in economics at Sussex University. That is not to say that there aren\u2019t steps that Germany could take to reduce its surplus. Many German economists have long argued that the government should respond to the country\u2019s demographic challenges by boosting public investment in areas such as education, physical infrastructure and digitization which would boost long-term productivity and potential growth. Germany could also benefit from undertaking the sort of structural reforms it has long urged on others, including measures to encourage female participation in the workforce, increase the retirement age and open up Germany\u2019s highly restricted services sectors. Others have argued that the new coalition government has no need to run a large fiscal surplus and should cut taxes to encourage spending."]

American and Delta have ceased all flights to India in recent years because of added competition.

["Heard on the Street", "Business lending was sluggish for most of last year. Bankers and analysts alike attributed the drag to general uncertainty in the aftermath of the 2016 election and a lack of clarity over future tax policy in particular. Now that corporate tax cuts have passed, one might expect a new shot of confidence to juice corporate borrowing. But the flip side is that because of the tax cut companies now have more cash, so they have less need to borrow. This most obviously includes multinationals that have repatriated billions of dollars of overseas profits. In addition, a lower tax rate for ordinary companies, which pay taxes quarterly, means they have higher free cash flows throughout the year and thus less need for working capital loans from banks. Interest-rate movements also play a role. When rates dipped around August last year, many companies tapped credit lines or refinanced loans, says Mr. Klock. Now that rates have moved higher, there is little incentive to go back to the well. In the near term this will likely be a headwind to bank earnings for one or two quarters. But if lower taxes succeed in their aim to boost growth and corporate investment, it will be long-term positive for bank lending. The Fed\u2019s latest Senior Loan Officer Survey, conducted in January but considered a forward indicator, gives some reason for optimism. Asked how demand for loans has changed over the past three months from large and medium-sized firms, 84% said it was \u201cabout the same\u201d or \u201csomewhat stronger,\u201d while just 16% said it was \u201cmoderately weaker.\u201d For small firms with annual sales of less than $50 million, 88% of bankers said loan demand was about the same or better, while only 12% said it was weaker."]

After all, why should a company with its own electricity to sell help a rival generator by moving the competitor\u2019s power to market? Regulators have long struggled to make vertically integrated companies charge only reasonable transmission rates to firms competing with them at other levels of their business. Attempting to control pricing and access terms is a lifelong, tedious and often futile way to preserve competition. Recall that in 1997 Time Warner tried to protect CNN by refusing to grant Fox News access to its cable system in New York City. New York was crucial to Fox, not only because of the market\u2019s size but because many advertising agencies are located in the city. By keeping Fox off its cable system, Time Warner could protect CNN from competition both for viewers and ad revenue. (Fox News and News Corp, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, today share common ownership.) New York City and state political leaders pleaded with Time Warner to open access to its monopoly franchise system. Only when Fox filed an antitrust action did the cable company relent. The affair proved that Time Warner was right, from the perspective of its own business interests, to use its monopoly at one level of a vertically integrated system to stifle competition at another. Fox was allowed to enter the New York market only because the antitrust laws provided it with a battering ram. Keeping Fox out benefited CNN and disadvantaged consumers, who were left with fewer choices."]
["Commentary (U.S.)", "Combining AT&T\u2019s distribution assets with Time Warner\u2019s content would create a merged entity with a strong incentive to stifle competition from new content providers. Whether it would have the legal power to do so is now a question for the courts. The proposed merger comes as the traditional barriers to entry into the content segment of the entertainment industry are breaking down. Alternatives to cable transmission are emerging. Someday those alternatives may make ownership of a cable system by a content provider irrelevant. We\u2019ll soon find out if that day has already arrived. If the Justice Department persuades the judge in this case that the threat to consumer choice is real, it could lead to a deal designed to preserve competition by restricting the merged company\u2019s behavior. This wouldn\u2019t work and would be a mistake.  When Ma Bell was vertically integrated, it controlled both the wires and the products that could be connected to those wires. Independent manufacturers of communications equipment were in effect prevented from entering the business. The vertically integrated company refused to allow consumers to connect anything not produced by its integrated manufacturer. I once had an AT&T representative demand that I remove a shoulder rest from my office telephone, as it was a \u201cforeign attachment\u201d\u2014meaning any device not manufactured by the AT&T-owned Western Electric.

["Commentary (U.S.)", "The Bell system was broken up in 1984, but a consent decree attempting to regulate the behavior of the resulting regional operating companies, the so-called Baby Bells, led to years of judicial control over every aspect of the telecommunications industry. Despite the court\u2019s best efforts, it could never do what structural relief eventually accomplished. The consent decree was lifted in 1996, unleashing the creativity of a manufacturing sector no longer smothered by a competitor with sole or preferred access to the message distribution system. It is just such structural relief that Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the new head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, says he prefers to a deal requiring regulatory supervision of a merged company for years to come. Such a deal would be especially calamitous for an industry that specializes in the creation of intellectual property and that is undergoing a period of rapid technological change. Judicial supervision would inevitably slow the pace of innovation.  Of course the courts could decide that merging AT&T and Time Warner poses no threat to competition.

["Politics and Policy", "Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan has emerged as one of the leading Republican critics of the president, using a tool Mr. Trump himself often employs\u2014an assertive presence on\n            Twitter\n            \n      \u2014to challenge and even taunt the president. While other House Republicans who were skeptical of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign have since toned down their criticism, Mr. Amash, who has 100,000 Twitter followers, has remained a vocal critic. Mr. Amash says his opposition is based on principle, as a libertarian concerned about government overreach and adherence to the Constitution. While many Republican lawmakers hold similar beliefs, Mr. Amash has been an especially outspoken proponent of smaller government, even on issues\u2014such as reducing surveillance\u2014where his views put him out of step with the more mainstream elements of the GOP.  \u201cTo me, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a Republican in the White House or a Democrat in the White House. I have a duty to defend liberty, defend the rule of law and protect the rights of all of my constituents,\u201d said Mr. Amash. The White House didn't respond to questions about Mr. Amash\u2019s Twitter posts or his views of the president. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Though he counts a large share of Trump voters among his constituents, Mr. Amash says he has little fear of speaking out. Elected in 2010 as part of the tea party wave, he won re-election last year in his Grand Rapids-area district by about 20 percentage points. Mr. Trump saw much narrower support in the district, which he won by 10 percentage points, according to results compiled by the liberal website Daily Kos. Official election results by congressional district aren\u2019t available from the state of Michigan. During the GOP presidential primaries, Mr. Amash supported Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and then Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. After the release of audio that revealed Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women, Mr. Amash called for him to drop out of the race, though he said he wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton either. Mr. Amash\u2019s continued criticism of Mr. Trump has at times put him at odds with party leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who have taken on the delicate task of recasting some of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to make them more consistent with mainstream Republican thinking.  \u201cLately, our leadership team seems to be going along with the president regardless of the situation,\u201d Mr. Amash said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that over time the leadership team will recognize that things are getting out of hand and will try to restrain the president.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "When Mr. Trump suspended immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations out of concerns about terrorism, Mr. Amash responded with a tweetstorm in which he called the executive order illegal. Immigrants with green cards, he said, cannot legally be banned on the basis of their nationality or place of birth. Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u201coverreaches and undermines our constitutional system,\u201d Mr. Amash wrote at the time. After the travel ban caused chaos at airports, the administration said the order didn't ban green card holders from entering the country. A draft of the revised rule makes this clear. Mr. Amash acknowledged that a president has wide latitude to ban refugees, though not green-card holders. But he called Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from certain countries \u201charsh and unwise,\u2019\u2019 and said well-vetted refugees should be admitted. When Mr. Trump attacked the federal judges who put his immigration order on hold, Mr. Amash counseled the president to \u201cstop attacking the legitimacy of the judiciary.\u201d Mr. Trump has said his immigration policies are needed for national security and that judges are overstepping their role by hindering him. The son of a Palestinian refugee father and a Syrian immigrant mother, Mr. Amash says his ideals come from a deep love of country instilled by his immigrant parents. When his father dropped him off at school every morning, he\u2019d tell him he could do anything in the U.S. It\u2019s with that perspective that he objects to the immigration ban."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cMost immigrants come here to make a better life, and they want to assimilate and be a part of our nation,\u201d said Mr. Amash, who was born in Grand Rapids. \u201cI think we need to remain a country that is welcoming to those immigrants. If my dad\u2019s family didn\u2019t have the generosity of Americans to bring him here, then I wouldn\u2019t be sitting right here in Congress.\u201d Mr. Amash says he supports congressional investigations into alleged communications between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives, and on Friday requested an immediate briefing from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey and Michael Dempsey, the acting Director of National Intelligence. He posted the letter to Twitter.  Another libertarian lawmaker, Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.), who considers Mr. Amash a friend, calls the Michigan congressman dependable in his views. \u201cJustin has consistently criticized Obama and Trump, both of them,\u201d for immigration laws he didn\u2019t agree with, Mr. Massie said.  Brian Ellis,  a Grand Rapids businessman who challenged Mr. Amash in a contentious primary race in 2014, is critical of the lawmaker for not supporting the president, though he himself supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich until Mr. Trump won the nomination. Mr. Ellis says people have approached him to express the same dissatisfaction.  \u201cI had one person come up to me and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t support you when you ran, but the last straw for me was when [Amash] didn\u2019t support our nominee,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ellis sad. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Susan J. Demas, publisher of the Inside Michigan Politics newsletter, said Mr. Amash showed his political skills at a February town hall in Grand Rapids, the most urban area of the lawmaker\u2019s district. Like many House Republicans in recent weeks, he was greeted by a large crowd angry at the GOP\u2019s agenda. Mr. Amash was booed for his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, as other Republican colleagues have been. But by the end of the session, which he extended by 40 minutes to answer more questions, Mr. Amash had calmed the crowd. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush praised Mr. Amash\u2019s approach on Twitter after the town hall, saying the Michigan Republican was \u201csetting the right example\u201c for conservatives. \u201cI think there was frustration, but it didn\u2019t boil over\u2019\u2019 the way it did at town halls held by some other GOP lawmakers, Ms. Demas said. \u201cHe\u2019s generally better at listening to people than some of his colleagues.\u201d \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

["Markets Main", "Affirm, based in San Francisco, is run by\n            PayPal\n            \n      co-founder Max Levchin. Affirm and Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., are nearing an agreement on a pilot in which Affirm would offer installment loans to some Wal-Mart shoppers in the U.S. as soon as this fall, the people said.  The financing\u00a0at first\u00a0would be available in select locations and to certain customers online, though it could expand later if the program proves successful enough.\u00a0Affirm\u2019s loans will be largely geared to costlier Wal-Mart items like tires and other purchases over $200, a person familiar with the matter said. Installment loans, which are designed to be paid off by a certain date, generally appeal to shoppers who want to spread out their payments over time. Affirm\u2019s installment loans have fixed annual percentage rates that often range from 10% to 30% depending in part on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. Rates for purchases on Synchony Wal-Mart credit cards are variable and run from 17.9% to 23.9%. Affirm doesn\u2019t charge borrowers late fees, while those fees on Synchrony\u2019s Wal-Mart cards are up to $38. Affirm\u2019s loans are often geared to people who don\u2019t have enough of a borrowing history to get a credit card.\u00a0The firm\u2019s average loan is about $750, but its loan sizes generally run up to $10,000.\u00a0The company has repayment periods that range three to 24 months with an average term of nine months."]
["Markets Main", "At Synchrony, the average balance per active store-card account across the company was $935 in the second quarter, according to an analysis by Autonomous Research. Affirm wouldn\u2019t issue cards, but its loans could provide some customers with another financing option. That could create new problems for Synchrony, the largest U.S. store credit-card issuer, whose shares have fallen 17% this year amid concern that rising defaults could hit profits. Warren Buffett\u2019s\n            Berkshire Hathaway\n Inc.\n      bought Synchrony shares during the second quarter, giving the stock a boost last week. U.S. consumers are once again taking on more debt, while credit-card charge-offs are rising following a long decline. Many retailers, under pressure from online competition, are seeking to expand their customers\u2019 access to financing as a way to boost sales. Wal-Mart is one of Synchrony\u2019s largest retail card partners, accounting for more than 10% of its total interest and fees on loans in 2016, according to data from the lender. Synchrony, which spun out of\n            General Electric\n Co.\n      , has been the exclusive Wal-Mart credit card issuer for the past 17 years. It will keep that post, though some Wal-Mart shoppers could soon be deciding between signing up for a Synchrony credit card or an Affirm loan to make their Wal-Mart purchases."]
["Markets Main", "Affirm and Wal-Mart have been in contact since 2014, but the talks picked up last year when Wal-Mart became more interested in increasing financing approvals for customers, one of the people said. Retailers depend in part on their credit-card issuers to approve a large number of shoppers, hoping doing so will boost sales. The sales slump that has recently hit many retailers likely adds to that dependency, said Matthew O\u2019Neill,  an analyst at Autonomous Research who covers the store-credit card industry. Wal-Mart has so far bucked the retail trend as its U.S. same-store sales have risen for 12 straight quarters. The retail giant, however, is facing more competition from\n            Amazon.com\n Inc.\n More retailers have been seeking out alternative options separate from their credit-card issuers in an attempt to get more approvals. That includes signing up an additional lender that will approve borrowers that the primary lender won\u2019t. For their part, card issuers must balance a desire to increase purchase volumes with a need to maintain credit quality and keep losses in check. That has grown more important over the past year as credit performance at card issuers has started to deteriorate after years of superlow default rates. Synchrony is looking at making adjustments to its underwriting approaches with new technology and models, according to people familiar with the company. It is testing technology from vendors including ZestFinance, which has software that helps lenders determine the riskiness of consumers, including those with little to no credit history, people familiar with the matter said."]
["Markets Main", "In addition to helping to boost approvals, the efforts could help Synchrony to reduce fraud and losses, the people said. Affirm last year began providing financing to shoppers at online home-goods retailer\n            Wayfair\n Inc.,\n      allowing them to spread the cost of the purchases over several months. Similarly,\n            Expedia\n Inc.\n      and Motorola Mobility LLC are among the companies that have also tapped Affirm to complement or replace their existing credit-card relationships.

Levine/Zuma Press By \nNick Timiraos\n and  \nRichard Rubin\n President Donald Trump\u2019s budget on Tuesday will propose a $193 billion reduction in spending on the food-stamp program over a decade, according to people familiar with the plans.

President Donald Trump\u2019s budget on Tuesday will propose a $193 billion reduction in spending on the food-stamp program over a decade, according to people familiar with the plans.  The proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, are part of a plan to reduce spending by around $1.7 trillion over a decade on programs such as Medicaid, food assistance and other anti-poverty efforts, according to people familiar with the plans. The SNAP cuts would represent a 29% reduction in funding from levels estimated in January by the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. spent nearly $71 billion on SNAP last year."]
["Politics and Policy", "Mr. Trump\u2019s budget would be able to project such spending declines in part by assuming the benefits of a much stronger economy, which would boost incomes and lift more Americans out of federal safety nets. It isn\u2019t clear how much of the funding decline would come from changes to growth estimates and how much from changes to eligibility requirements. The budget also is expected to call for saving about $40 billion over a decade by changing eligibility rules for the earned-income tax credit and child tax credit, two programs that deliver money to low-income households through the tax code. The changes are part of a broader projection by the White House that it can balance the budget in 10 years. It claims to be doing so without making changes to the two largest drivers of government spending\u2014Medicare and Social Security. Mr. Trump promised no changes to those programs during last year\u2019s campaign. However, the administration may be redefining that promise now that Mr. Trump is in office. One outstanding question is whether Mr. Trump will propose cuts to federal disability insurance programs, which fall under the Social Security umbrella. Disability has been a top target for changes from some Republicans in recent years. The budget will incorporate changes in a health-care bill approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month. That bill included more than $800 billion in reduced spending on Medicaid over a decade. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget will show an even greater funding reduction, said one person familiar with the proposal."]
["Politics and Policy", "The changes to so-called mandatory spending programs, which aren\u2019t subject to annual spending bills passed by Congress and are instead on autopilot, would add to other deep spending cuts the administration will outline for nondefense budgets covering foreign aid, education, the environment and housing. The Trump administration will forecast the U.S. economy expanding at a 3% annual rate by 2021 as a result of its policies to cut taxes and regulation, compared with the CBO\u2019s forecast of 1.9% growth. The CBO forecast assumes current policy remains unchanged. The CBO will provide its own analysis of the president\u2019s budget after it is sent to Congress. Republicans in Congress have already focused on overhauling the food-stamp program. They have raised concerns that they fund purchases of junk food and discourage recipients from seeking higher-paying work. Democrats have said those changes could hurt poor families. Congress hasn\u2019t significantly changed food-stamp rules since a 1977 law. But the House last year held 16 hearings related to overhauling SNAP, culminating in a December report that suggested changes to eligibility rules and new limits on what items qualify for assistance. Food stamps can\u2019t be used to buy alcohol, tobacco or hot, prepared foods. Participation in the food-stamp program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is nearly double from levels before the 2007-09 recession, even though unemployment has returned to prerecession lows. More than 42 million Americans received food assistance as of February, with an average monthly benefit of $124.99. Food-stamp use peaked at the end of 2012, with nearly 47.8 million beneficiaries."]
["Politics and Policy", "Officials with the National Grocers Association said they were still evaluating the proposal, but emphasized that supermarkets have worked with the USDA to make food stamps more efficient. \u201cThe program still plays an important role in providing a safety net to those in need, including families with children, the elderly, and disabled,\u201d said Greg Ferrara, senior vice president of government relations and public affairs for the association representing more than 1,300 independent grocers. Celebrity chef and food activist Tom Colicchio called the cuts \u201cmisplaced.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad for our communities and in the end will be bad for the American economy,\u201d said Mr. Colicchio, co-founder of the Food Policy Action advocacy group.  Republicans in Congress also have been trying for years to overhaul rules for child tax credits. The GOP wants to require child credit recipients to produce Social Security numbers instead of the taxpayer identification numbers that can be used by immigrants without legal authorization to work in the U.S. An inspector general\u2019s study found that the government paid more than $4 billion in 2010 alone to tax filers who didn\u2019t use Social Security numbers. Democrats have resisted the change, saying it would hurt poor children, many of whom are citizens. While the budget isn\u2019t expected to reveal new details about Mr. Trump\u2019s tax-overhaul plans, his economic advisers last month outlined principles that show significant cuts in tax rates for businesses and high-income households. Some budget analysts said some Republicans may resist spending cuts for safety-net programs."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cPolitically that is extremely difficult, when you\u2019re talking about tax reform that would appear on the face of it to benefit the upper-income brackets, while you\u2019re reducing support to the lower-income groups,\u201d said William Hoagland, a former congressional Republican budget aide who is now at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3% Friday, recovering most of morning losses that worsened after President Donald Trump doubled down with tweets on a pledge made a day earlier to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  His plan sent overseas stocks tumbling and was met with warnings of retaliation across Asia, Europe and North America.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average ended the day 2.5% lower as steelmakers and car manufacturers came under pressure, while London\u2019s FTSE 100 returned to levels last seen in 2016.  Despite staging a comeback, major U.S. indexes suffered their worst week since early February. Although the market scare over the tariffs at least temporarily abated, a number of other fears linger as investors reassess the prospects for continued global growth, brace for the possibility of a broader trade war and await the outcome of an parliamentary election in Italy."]
["Today's Markets", "\u201cProtectionism is not a good thing, and the ramifications for this could be significant,\u201d said Michael Farr,  president of money-management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, adding that the strategy Mr. Trump is posturing could take a swipe at growth around the globe. \u201cThis is a big deal.\u201d He added that the stock market\u2019s recovery in afternoon trading is encouraging, but there\u2019s reason to remain wary. \u201cStarting a trade war would be reckless,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can be sanguine talking about any war, even if it\u2019s just economic.

Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1%, though the indexes posted weekly losses of 2% and 1.1%, respectively. In a flight to relative safety, gold rose 1.4% to $1,321.10 a troy ounce, shares of gold miners jumped and the yen strengthened 0.5% against the dollar. But government bonds found little support. Yields on 10-year Treasurys rose to 2.855% Friday from 2.802% Thursday. Yields rise as prices fall. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade proposal, as well as comments from new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier in the week, added to an investment landscape already characterized by fears about inflation and tighter monetary policy. These jitters have rendered stock and bond markets more susceptible to big swings in recent weeks, as investors worry that a yearslong policy of low short-term interest rates and accommodative central banks could be upended more quickly than expected."]
["Today's Markets", " James Bianco,  head of advisory firm Bianco Research, said expectations for an uninterrupted stream of stimulus by foreign central banks created an environment that allowed investors to discount potentially disruptive events. \u201cWe talked about the exit for nine years, and no one thought it would happen until last month, said Mr. Bianco, referring to discussions among global central-bank policy makers about halting bond purchases. \u201cIf [President Trump] made this announcement six weeks ago, the markets would\u2019ve rolled through it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re emotionally spent with Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve thrown so many shoes at the TV, we\u2019re about out of shoes.\u201d Leaders around the world are expected to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff plan, stirring more uncertainty for markets. Already the government of Ontario, home to the bulk of Canada\u2019s steel production, urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to \u201caggressively explore all options\u201d if the Trump administration pushes ahead with the broad tariffs. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Europe would respond with tariffs on\n            Harley-Davidson\n            \n      motorcycles, bourbon and blue jeans. \u201cWhat investors are reacting to is how will this affect global growth,\u201d said James Norman, president at QS Investors, which manages roughly $22 billion. \u201cNo one wins a trade war.\u201d \u201cThe most important takeaway from this week is uncertainty has increased,\u201d he added."]

["Business", "JAB\u2019s purchase offers new life to Keurig as its struggles with declining sales, and renders profitable the stake held by Coca-Cola Co., its largest shareholder, which found its stake nearly $1 billion underwater as of Friday. The acquisition, announced Monday, is a major doubling down on coffee for JAB, which manages the money of one of Germany\u2019s wealthiest families, the Reimanns.  The investment firm, which also owns other assets including luxury brands Bally and Jimmy Choo PLC and beauty-products maker Coty Inc., is betting that adding Keurig\u2019s technology and its reach in the U.S. to its current holdings can make it a stronger rival to competitors including Nestl\u00e9 SA, the world\u2019s largest packaged-coffee company. Keurig has a roughly 20% share of the packaged-coffee market in the U.S., according to Euromonitor International Inc.\u2014although it shares some of its revenue with brands like\n            Starbucks\n Corp.\n      whose coffee it packages into its K-Cups. Stifel Capital Markets estimated that adding Keurig would increase JAB\u2019s share of the $80 billion global market for packaged coffee to mid-to-high-teens percentage, compared with a mid-20s percentage for Nestl\u00e9. Buying Keurig could help JAB further its mission to become \u201cthe Bud(weiser) of the coffee space,\u201d said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Pablo Zuanic. JAB said little about its plans beyond a statement in which Chairman Bart Becht said the deal \u201crepresents a major step forward in the creation of our global coffee platform.\u201d "]
["Business", "He said Keurig is \u201ca fantastic company that uniquely brings together premium coffee brands\u201d and its single-serve technology for machines and pods. Keurig will operate as an independent entity after the deal, he said. The acquisition follows a string of other coffee-related deals for JAB. It bought U.S.-based chains Caribou Coffee Co. and Peet\u2019s Coffee & Tea in 2012, then last year acquired the parent company of Einstein Bros. Bagels. This year JAB acquired two upscale, niche players in the U.S., Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Intelligentsia Coffee Inc. JAB, this year, also merged its D.E. Master Blenders brand with the international coffee business of U.S. snack-food maker\n            Mondelez International\n Inc.\n Analysts said JAB could see opportunity to expand Keurig\u2019s brewers to Europe, where it doesn\u2019t yet compete with pod-based brewers like Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Nespresso. Euromonitor beverage analyst Virginia Lee said taking Keurig private also will let it \u201cmake adjustments to its marketing and product development strategy away from the scrutiny of the investment community.\u201d Other aspects of JAB\u2019s strategy are less clear, such as how it plans to leverage its added scale to gain better purchasing price or any other synergies. Mark Astrachan, an analyst at Stifel, said the deal could pose a risk to connections Keurig has within the industry such as its deal with Starbucks to make K-Cup pods. Starbucks is a direct competitor with companies that JAB owns."]
["Business", "The deal values Keurig at $92 a share, compared with its Friday close of $51.70. Keurig\u2019s stock had fallen 67% as of Friday from its all-time closing high of $157.10 in November 2014. The merger agreement includes a $475 million termination fee, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday. The acquisition hurt investors who had bet on Keurig\u2019s poor performance continuing by borrowing its shares to sell short.  Among them was David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital Inc., which said in October that its Keurig position had been one of its top moneymakers this year.  Greenlight still had a small short position in Keurig as of Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors benefited from the deal, including Ricky Sandler\u2019s $6.5 billion Eminence Capital LLC, which said a week ago that it had amassed a 7.2% stake in Keurig. Keurigs\u2019s coffee pods and single-serve machines redefined the U.S. market, but by last year, sales were stagnating and private-label makers of coffee pods were a competitive threat. Keurig\u2019s revenue in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 26 fell 4% to $4.52 billion, while profit slid 16% to $498 million. Chief Executive Brian Kelley,  a former Coke executive, bet on a new brewing system called Keurig 2.0 launched last year that brews different-sized pots and specialty drinks. Sales of the new machines have disappointed, Keurig has said."]
["Business", "Mr. Kelley also pushed the development of a machine, dubbed Kold, that makes carbonated beverages in the kitchen and competes with SodaStream International Ltd. That enticed Coke to build a 17.4% stake in Keurig, and on Kold\u2019s launch in late September began selling pods for the machine from Coke brands. Coke said it paid roughly $91 a share for its Keurig investment. The acquisition by JAB would enable Coke to reap a $25 million gain. Cashing out gives Coke more funds to make other acquisitions or return cash to shareholders. But it also represents an unwinding of one of Coke\u2019s biggest bets in recent years. Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent called the Kold machine, a \u201creal game-changing\u201d innovation when Coke announced its 10-year Keurig partnership in February 2014. Since then, many analysts have cooled on Kold, saying it is too bulky and expensive. Brian Holland,  an analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said Keurig let expectations get too high for Kold. Building up that business is going to take years, \u201cand the investor scrutiny that this company faces was going to make it difficult for them to keep their eye on that long-term strategy.\u201d Mr. Kent said Monday that Coke will continue its collaboration with JAB on single-serve, pod-based machines like Kold. \u2014Mike Esterl, Anne Steele and Juliet Chung  contributed to this article.

The result was the Kerner report, issued 50 years ago last month. The report blamed black urban unrest on white racism, segregation and official neglect, all of which continue to get cited to explain the racial inequality that persists today. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood\u2014but what the Negro can never forget\u2014is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the introduction read. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d The riots were attributed to \u201cthe failure of all levels of government\u2014Federal and state, as well as local\u2014to come to grips with the problems of our cities.\u201d"]
["Upward Mobility", "The Kerner report\u2019s most famous assertion was that the U.S. was \u201cmoving toward two societies, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal,\u201d even though the decades leading up to the riots had suggested the opposite. The Truman administration\u2019s desegregation of the armed forces in the 1940s was followed by Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s successful civil-rights movement of the 1950s and the passage of landmark civil-rights and voting-rights legislation in the 1960s. The educational and economic strides blacks made during this period were also unprecedented, and racial disparities were narrowing. In 1960, just 7% of blacks between 20 and 24 were enrolled in college; by 1970, that percentage had more than doubled, to 16%. College enrollment among whites also rose during this period, but not by as much. These educational gains allowed more blacks to lift themselves out of poverty and access better-paying jobs. Between 1940 and 1970, the proportion of families living below the poverty line fell by 40 percentage points among whites and by 57 points among blacks. White-black gaps in homeownership, life expectancy and white-collar employment also were shrinking in the postwar era, contrary to the pessimism of the Kerner Commission. Moreover, white racial attitudes were shifting. In 1942, national support for school integration stood at 30%; two decades later it would be 62%. By 1963, racial discrimination in public accommodations was already illegal in 30 states, and more than 80% of whites were opposed to restricting job opportunities by race."]
["Upward Mobility", "None of this suggests that 50 years ago racial discrimination in housing and employment, or bigotry in the criminal justice system, was a figment of blacks\u2019 imagination. And while there was measurable social and economic improvement in the postwar period, racial gaps persisted, as they still do today. Nevertheless, it\u2019s difficult to square this racial progress with the Kerner report\u2019s description of the riots as an \u201cexplosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II.\u201d The reality is that the worst rioting of the 1960s was concentrated in the North and West rather than in the Deep South, where racial oppression was most severe and racial attitudes were slowest to change. The year before the 1965 riots in the Watts section of Los Angeles, a leading civil-rights organization had ranked living standards in L.A. as best in the nation for black families. When Detroit rioted two years later, the black unemployment rate in the city was lower than the white unemployment rate nationwide; black Detroiters had the highest homeownership rate in the nation; and the black poverty rate in Motown was just half the national average among blacks. The Kerner report\u2019s attempts to blame everybody for the rioting except the rioters strain credulity."]
["Upward Mobility", "The commission was also overly pessimistic in many ways about the direction the country was heading. In his new book, \u201cEnlightenment Now,\u201d Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker shows that steady progress in social attitudes continues today, whether the measure is interracial dating, racist jokes or antiblack crimes. \u201cNo form of progress is inevitable, but the historical erosion of racism, sexism and homophobia are more than a change in fashion,\u201d he writes. \u201cRacial segregation, male-only suffrage and the criminalization of homosexuality are literally indefensible: people tried to defend them in their times, and they lost the argument.\u201d We can\u2019t hope to address effectively the social pathology on display in so many black ghettos by playing down the role of culture and personal responsibility so as to keep the focus on white racism. What blacks were doing on their own to develop human capital and to narrow racial gaps in the first half of the 20th century has a far better record of success than any government program. This history is seldom discussed among politicians in search of votes or activists in search of relevance, but it ought to be part of any serious national debate about racial inequality today. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Oil prices have surged to the highest levels in more than two years.

["Markets Main", "Since the November 2016 agreement to cut supply by 1.8 million barrels from peak October levels, Brent, the global benchmark for oil, has jumped 37% to $63.61 a barrel through Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. reference price, has increased more than 28% to $57.99 in the same period.  But prices have retreated this week, as doubts emerge over whether the agreement will come together on Thursday. Analysts have said continued cuts are necessary to help the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries achieve its goal in bringing inventories back to the five-year average. Stockpiles have fallen closer to that level since the initial decision to cut supply. Several members of the original agreement have\u00a0indicated their intentions to stick with the deal. Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s largest oil producer, has spoken out strongly in favor of extending the cuts past the current expiration in March 2018. But Russia remains the biggest concern for investors. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s energy minister said the agreement should be extended but declined to say for how long. Traders are worried that Russia could derail a deal by pushing back against plans to extend cuts through the end of 2018. With the length and terms of the extension unclear, analysts warn that energy markets will likely be volatile leading up to and after the meeting. \u201cWe believe that the outcome of this meeting is much more uncertain than usual,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a note Monday. \u201cWe view risks to oil prices as skewed to the downside this week.\u201d"]
["Markets Main", "Prices and positioning already reflect a high probability of a nine-month extension, the analysts said. Even if investors are encouraged by OPEC\u2019s announcement on Thursday, prices could still retreat. On May 25, OPEC agreed to continue cutting back supply. Yet oil prices fell almost 5% that day. Oil prices have advanced in the past year, and bullish speculative bets have reached record highs in both the U.S. and Brent markets. Futures positions indicate speculators see oil prices rising after the meeting. Net long positions\u2014or bets that crude prices will rise\u2014held by speculative investors recently reached a record for Brent, data from Intercontinental Exchange show. Net bullish bets on U.S. oil also hovered near all-time highs. Should OPEC disappoint and prices slump, the unwinding of such positions could add to volatility in the oil market. Since last November, a closely watched indicator has flipped to signal the supply glut may be easing. In 2016, prices for oil delivered in the future were higher than spot prices. But this year, oil for immediate delivery has become more expensive than for delivery in the future\u2014a relationship that signals high demand and discourages traders from keeping crude in storage. Bullish options positions have also ramped up. The number of bullish bets that pay out if Brent hits $100 a barrel next year\u2014roughly 60% above its current price\u2014have jumped ahead of the OPEC meeting, according to data from CME Group, though contracts tied to WTI are more heavily traded than Brent on the exchange. Around the same time ahead of last year\u2019s OPEC meeting, there were zero call options positions tied to this level expiring this December. "]

["Television Review", "Nonetheless, the story of Joseph Kennedy Sr.\u2019s rise to wealth and power and of his famous children is richly illuminating, not least because it plays out, decade after decade, against the backdrop of momentous history brought to life here with powerfully evocative footage. Appointed U.S. Ambassador to Britain in 1938, Joe Kennedy Sr. immediately made news as a tireless proponent of the faith that both Britain and the U.S. must do all that was necessary to accommodate Adolf Hitler in order to avoid a war with Germany that the British, certainly, were doomed to lose. Kennedy\u2019s pronouncements on the prospects for Britain\u2019s survival, his highly public support of efforts to appease Hitler, would, as he later recognized, rule out any possibility he might obtain the office he wanted most\u2014namely, the presidency. He would transfer that ambition into efforts to ensure that one of his sons won the office. The one who ended up chosen, John Kennedy,  had, initially, no great interest in pursuing a political career. A young man just back from the war, he was more inclined to a life of parties and women.

She was unhappy at her wedding not only because the reception was packed with hordes of people she didn\u2019t know\u2014invited by Joe\u2014but also because she disliked her wedding dress, which she said made her look like a lampshade.

Labor Department data Friday showed nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 228,000 in November\u2014the record 86th straight month of expansion\u2014after a 244,000 gain in October. Steady hiring has in turn driven the unemployment rate down to 4.1% for two straight months, holding at a 17-year low. That would put economic output on track for a third straight quarter of near 3% growth, a breakout, for now at least, from a long period of 2% growth. The economy hasn\u2019t delivered three straight quarters of growth at or above 3% since a period from mid-2004 to early 2005.

["Economic Data", "The economy has stumbled at other points in the eight years since the recession ended and might do so again, but it appears at the moment to be on especially firm footing.  Hiring slowed after hurricanes in August and September but has powered back. Meanwhile business investment is accelerating, stocks have hit records, consumer confidence remains strong, and the rest of the global economy is on an upswing. Economic growth accelerated in Europe during the summer months and Japan is experiencing its longest sustained expansion in 16 years. \u201cGlobally everyone is running in the same direction,\u201d said Gregory Daco, economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThat sets up global growth in 2018 to be the best since the crisis.\u201d Investors greeted the latest jobs news as another sign the economy is advancing at a robust and sustainable pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 117.68 points Friday, or 0.49%, at 24329.16. One gray mark in Friday\u2019s report was wage growth. Average hourly earnings for private-sector workers increased five cents last month after declining in October. Wages were up 2.5% from a year earlier in November\u2014near the same lackluster pace maintained since late 2015. The low jobless rate might mean workers are finally getting the bargaining power to start demanding and winning higher wages, though longer-run forces are helping to hold wages in check. Well-paid baby boomers are being replaced by lower-earning millennials and the development of a global labor market means factory workers in Ohio compete with those in China.\u00a0And still soft inflation makes it hard for companies to pass along wage increases to customers."]
["Economic Data", "Sparkhound LLC, a Baton Rouge, La., technology company that helps clients migrate their data to cloud storage, is hiring, including recently doubling the size of its more-than 50-person Houston office. General Manager Dave Baxter said the company is seeing pressure to raise wages for workers with technology skills\u2014but it is having difficulty passing along cost increases to clients, especially because its services are sold as a cost-saving technology.  To respond, Sparkhound focuses most of its hiring on less experienced workers, who command lower salaries, and partners five or six of those workers with a seasoned veteran. \u201cBaton Rouge is a tough market to find experienced people,\u201d Mr. Baxter said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some folks fresh out of school.\u201d It is hard at this point to pinpoint how much of the apparent economic uptrend can be attributed to policies coming out of Washington and how much is due to other factors. The Trump administration points to its efforts to cut taxes and pare back business regulation. But other factors\u2014such as long-delayed economic recoveries in Japan and Europe\u2014are also likely independently at play. Some executives say tax cuts will help if they happen. Laurel Highland Total Communications, a cable and phone company that operates in rural areas of Pennsylvania, has kept its staff lean in recent years in response to a lackluster economy in the region and burdensome regulations,\u200bsaid Chief Executive Jim Kail. The company is now looking to add a few workers to its 65-person staff."]
["Economic Data", "\u201cIf the corporate rates go down, that frees up a lot of cash. We\u2019d be looking to hire and make investment in equipment,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Kail said. Megan Greene, economist at Manulife Asset Management, doubts the tax plan will boost economic growth in the longer run. Business investment incentives, she notes, phase out after five years. \u201cIt could be a short-term sugar hit that will stoke the stock market, but not set us up for sustainable growth moving forward,\u201d she said. In the near-term, a combination of low unemployment and modest wage growth and inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradually pushing up short-term interest rates, including another rate increase at the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting next week. Central bankers could become more inclined to push rates up at a slightly faster pace next year if the job market keeps cranking out strong monthly gains. In September, Fed officials forecast the unemployment rate would end this year at 4.3%, and end next year at 4.1%, meaning the job market has already hit the milestones officials thought would take an additional year to reach. \u201cThe Fed has to be cognizant of the fact that if we run employment at 4%, inflation could rise above their 2% target,\u201d said Gus Faucher, economist at PNC Financial Services. \u201cIf they let unemployment get too low, they may have to raise rates more aggressively, and that risks causing a recession.\u201d"]
["Economic Data", "Another risk is that financial markets overheat even as the real economy seems to be on strong and sustainable footing. The unemployment rate was last below 4% in late 2000, just as a technology bubble was entering its last phases. A recession began in March 2001. A broad measure of unemployment and underemployment that includes Americans stuck in part-time jobs or too discouraged to look for work ticked up to 8% in November, but remained near the lowest level since 2006. Meanwhile, the share of the population between 25 and 54 years old that has a job, 79%, touched the highest level since the recession ended in 2009. Those figures suggest there are relatively few Americans left to be drawn off the sidelines of the labor market. Linn Mariano, 23, thought she would need to return to school to land the professional job she desired. She holds an associate degree form a community college and was worried about the expense of more schooling. Instead, she was accepted into the Year Up program, which provided her job training and set her up with an internship at drugmaker Pfizer Inc.\u2019s offices in Groton, Conn. She moved from intern, to contractor, and this fall was hired on full-time as an analyst. The position came with a raise, vacation time and retirement benefits. \u201cThis will the first time since I\u2019ve been working I could take off Christmas week,\u201d said Ms. Mariano, who plans to visit family in Georgia. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to apply yourself, there are good jobs out there, even if you don\u2019t have a four-year degree.\u201d"]

Senators pressed Mr. Stumpf to do more, including clawing back pay from top executives who oversaw the conduct and forgoing a bonus himself. \u201cYou are scapegoating the people at the very bottom,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.). Ms. Warren pressed Mr. Stumpf about whether the bank should punish top executives through smaller bonuses or clawbacks. When Mr. Stumpf demurred, she asked: \u201cIf you have no opinions on the most massive fraud that has hit this bank since the beginning of time, how can it be that you actually get to continue to collect a paycheck?\u201d \u201cI disagree with the fact this is a massive fraud,\u201d Mr. Stumpf replied.  Most discussion focused on Wells Fargo, though Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) told Mr. Stumpf that Wells Fargo was \u201cgiving ammunition to the folks who want to break up the big banks.\u201d"]
["Financial Regulation", "Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the committee chairman who called the hearing, questioned why bank regulators hadn\u2019t asked about these issues sooner. Democrats defended the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which fined Wells Fargo in the case. Regulators said they were looking into whether similar conduct took place at other banks.  In some of the most heated exchanges of the day, Mr. Stumpf elaborated on the role of former retail-banking head Carrie Tolstedt,  who stepped down from her position in July and is set to retire at the end of this year. Mr. Stumpf said he hadn\u2019t thought about firing Ms. Tolstedt, but that he and Chief Operating Officer Timothy Sloan felt that Ms. Tolstedt hadn\u2019t made enough progress on sales-practices issues and that the bank wanted to \u201cgo in a different direction.\u201d Ms. Tolstedt ultimately decided to retire, he said. Ms. Tolstedt didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment and the bank declined to comment on her behalf. Mr. Stumpf also declined to comment on whether the scandal should affect his pay, which last year was valued at $19.3 million, or Ms. Tolstedt\u2019s, who got a $9.05 million package, according to company filings. Mr. Stumpf said the matter is up to the human-resources committee of Wells Fargo\u2019s board. Mr. Stumpf chairs the board, but doesn\u2019t sit on the committee. Wells Fargo also said Tuesday it is expanding its internal investigation to possible cross-selling abuses in 2009 and 2010. Previously, the bank had looked back through 2011. The bank will continue to work to reach affected customers."]
["Financial Regulation", "During the hearing, Mr. Stumpf apologized at least a half-dozen times while still defending the bank\u2019s core strategy of selling multiple products to each customer. \u201cCross-selling is all about pumping up Wells\u2019s stock price, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. Warren asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Stumpf replied. \u201cCross-selling is short-hand for deepening relationships.\u201d  Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com and Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.com \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Those audits will evaluate everything from the technology being used and how it\u2019s integrated on YouTube\u2019s website and app to the way the data is crunched."]
["CMO", "In addition, Google plans to have the MRC audit data for ads on non-Google sites purchased via two key Google ad buying tech platforms\u2014AdWords and DoubleClick Bid Manager. These audits should be welcome news in the digital ad industry, where marketers have been pushing for more transparency and overall assurance that the ads they pay for end up where they are supposed to and can be seen by consumers.  Companies like Google and Facebook, which dominate the online ad industry, have faced criticisms that they have been \u201cgrading their own homework\u201d because they have traditionally collected and self-reported so much of their own viewer data. While marketers lean on third-party metrics companies that have approval to work with the platforms, those metrics firms aren't always allowed to directly do their own measurements and instead receive and record data provided to them by YouTube or Facebook.  \u201cOur data has to be trusted and comprehensive. We are very in tune with the idea,\u201d said Babak Pahlavan, Google\u2019s senior director of product management, analytics solutions and measurement. Mr. Pahlavan said that Google\u2019s move had been in the works for years and wasn't a reaction to industry pressure or Facebook\u2019s recent announcement. Given YouTube\u2019s scale (it reaches a billion people and every day its users stream hundreds of millions of hours of videos), it\u2019s a massive challenge to conduct such integrations, but the goal is to complete the process over the next two quarters, Mr. Pahlavan added."]
["CMO", "He noted that Google has already had 30 of its various ad metrics audited by the MRC\u2014including for several other YouTube ad products\u2014and has been working with the measurement standard-bearer for more than a decade. \u201cWe\u2019ve been investing in trust for a long time,\u201d he said. Over the past several years, a large number of media companies have agreed to work with third parties like Moat or DoubleVerify to track viewability data. And these third parties have individually been audited by the MRC. But because giant platforms like YouTube and Facebook have been reluctant to implement third party tracking code from these vendors directly, there has been some ongoing frustration in the ad buying community that these companies\u2019 data is less transparent than others. On top of that, Facebook has had a number of embarrassing data tracking mishaps, adding to the noise surrounding third party measurement and fueling the idea that the web\u2019s biggest ad platforms play by their own rules. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that this data is generally in the control of large platforms, and it\u2019s a little bit of a black box,\u201d said DoubleVerify President and Chief Executive Wayne Gattinella, who added that his company has been working on helping Google provide more transparent metrics for roughly a year.  \u201cThe market is saying, \u2018We want to ensure that the process [these companies employ] is understood, and is documented and accurate. Otherwise, it could be garbage in garbage out, and we\u2019re not able to determine that.\u2019 So this is all good news.\u201d"]

["Politics and Policy", "Within hours of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, North Korea made its most specific threat against the U.S. yet. Through its official media, North Korea said it was considering firing missiles at Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, and making the U.S. \u201cthe first to experience the might of the strategic weapons of the DPRK\u201d\u2014the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u2019s formal name.  Mr. Trump\u2019s stark comments reflect deep concern in the administration about the progress North Korea has made in recent months on its nuclear-weapons program, as well as provocative statements this week that seemingly rejected negotiations over curbing that program.  The president\u2019s brief remarks at his golf resort in New Jersey likely were aimed both at North Korea, which this week openly threatened to use nuclear weapons, and at China, in hopes of alarming the Chinese into doing their part to enforce new United Nations economic sanctions against North Korea. Meanwhile, a senior Trump administration official said Tuesday that Washington shouldn\u2019t assume it will be able to contain a North Korea with nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles through traditional deterrence methods. \u201cWe are not going to allow North Korea to hold American cities hostage,\u201d the official said.  Mr. Trump vowed in January that North Korea wouldn\u2019t develop a nuclear weapon capable of striking parts of the U.S. While North Korea\u2019s state media regularly threatens strikes on the U.S. homeland and other U.S. military assets in Asia, they are usually vague in detail and rarely linked directly to an order from the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un."]
["Politics and Policy", "A spokesman for the Strategic Force of the Korean People\u2019s Army was quoted in state media as saying that the operational plan would be \u201csoon reported to the Supreme Command\u201d and \u201cwill be put into practice in a multi-concurrent and consecutive way any moment once Kim Jong Un, supreme commander of the nuclear force of the DPRK, makes a decision.\u201d In a statement published through its state media, North Korea\u2019s military urged the U.S. to \u201cclearly face up to the fact that the ballistic rockets of the Strategic Force of the KPA are now on constant standby, facing the Pacific Ocean.\u201d North Korea has conducted five nuclear weapons tests since 2006. U.S. officials long have believed the country has had the capability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to travel atop a ballistic missile, though they also think North Korea faces technical hurdles. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said during congressional testimony in May that the North Korean leader \u201cwas photographed beside a nuclear warhead design and missile airframes to show that North Korea has warheads small enough to fit on a missile.\u201d The Defense Intelligence Agency concluded \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d in a 2013 report read during a public congressional hearing that North Korea possessed \u201cnuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles.\u201d At the time, the agency believed their reliability was low.  Last month, the DIA also issued a new analysis concluding North Korea had produced nuclear weapons small enough to be carried by intercontinental ballistic missiles, U.S. officials confirmed."]
["Politics and Policy", " The Washington Post first reported the existence of that analysis on Tuesday, which refers to an assessment of the capability by the broader intelligence community.What has worried U.S. officials most in recent months, though, is the rapid progression of the country\u2019s program to field intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs\u2014long-range weapons that would allow North Korea to rocket warheads through the atmosphere to hit the continental U.S.  North Korea conducted its first ICBM test on July 4 and followed up with a second ICBM test on July 28 that experts said put the continental U.S. firmly in range of a strike. Analysts who have scrutinized footage of the test launches aren\u2019t in agreement about whether the tested devices have successfully re-entered the atmosphere without disintegrating. Also, U.S. officials say there isn\u2019t any indication that North Korea\u2019s miniaturized nuclear warhead could withstand re-entry.  In its remarks, published by Pyongyang\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, North Korea cited recent routine U.S. tests of American intercontinental ballistic missiles and U.S. Air Force flyovers of the Korean Peninsula this week as reasons for its move. The report said a missile attack would use the Hwasong-12 and target the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, from which the U.S. has sent its B-1B bombers several times this year to fly over the Korean Peninsula. A U.S. Pacific Command spokesman confirmed American B-1B bombers conducted a flyover this week."]

Seib examines whether Pyongyang will walk through the door the diplomatic effort has opened for them. Photo: Getty The missile and air force flyovers, North Korea said, were \u201cdriving the regional situation to an extreme pitch by bringing various kinds of nuclear strategic hardware before the very eyes of the DPRK.\u201d \u201cWar is by no means a game,\u201d North Korea said in one of its reports Wednesday. \u201cWe do not hide that we already have in full readiness the diversified strategic nuclear strike means which have the U.S. mainland in our striking range.\u201d The progress North Korea has made on its nuclear weapons program has presented Mr. Trump\u2019s administration with one of the toughest national-security challenges in a generation. Officials fear Mr. Kim could soon possess a weapon that can hold U.S. cities hostage with mass destruction, a threat administration officials say they won\u2019t accept. The Trump administration notched a significant win in its effort to push back on North Korea\u2019s threats at the U.N. on Saturday, when China joined the Security Council in unanimously passing a sanctions resolution aimed at slashing about $1 billion from North Korea\u2019s annual foreign export revenue. A senior administration official said Tuesday that China\u2019s vote showed that Beijing was increasingly viewing North Korea as a strategic liability rather than an asset."]
["Politics and Policy", "Whether the sanctions can work fast enough to prevent Mr. Kim from obtaining the capability to strike the U.S. with nuclear weapons remains unclear. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks Tuesday appeared to echo those that President Harry S. Truman made in 1945 after ordering the use of a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima and demanding Japan\u2019s surrender during World War II. Mr. Truman warned that if the Japanese failed to accept the U.S. terms of surrender, \u201cthey may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\u201d Mr. Trump didn\u2019t make clear what actions by North Korea would trigger such a dramatic U.S. response, or what precisely it would have to do to prevent it, raising the prospect of a miscommunication between Washington and Pyongyang at a moment of heightened tensions. Republican Sen. John McCain,  in an interview with Arizona radio station KTAR on Tuesday, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks: \u201cThat kind of rhetoric, I\u2019m not sure how it helps. \u2026 I take exception to the president\u2019s words because you got to be sure you can do what you say you\u2019re going to do.\u201d The administration has emphasized that it is leaving all options on the table, including military intervention. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the U.S. isn\u2019t seeking a regime change in North Korea and urged the country to stop its missile tests and enter a dialogue with Washington."]
["Politics and Policy", "One calculation the Trump administration must make is whether Mr. Kim is seeking the capability only to guarantee the survival of his regime, or whether he plans to leverage his newfound nuclear arsenal to pursue geostrategic aims in the region. For example, the Kim regime has long sought to divide the U.S. from its ally in South Korea and harbored ambitions of reunifying the Korean Peninsula on its own terms. \u201cI believe that any approach that somehow gives North Korea nuclear status is a mistake, because I think what they\u2019re ultimately after is to try to decouple us from South Korea,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, former assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and former U.S. ambassador to South Korea. Mr. Hill outlined a scenario in which North Korea develops a nuclear warhead that can strike the U.S. and then mounts a conventional invasion of South Korea to reunite the peninsula. Pyongyang could threaten the U.S. with a nuclear strike on a U.S. city should American forces come to South Korea\u2019s aid, forcing Washington to choose between the homeland and its ally. The senior Trump administration official said the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the luxury of assuming Mr. Kim won\u2019t pursue grand geopolitical ambitions once he obtains a reliable nuclear arsenal. \u201cThere are some who believe he seeks these weapons to maintain the status quo on the peninsula,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut if you listen to what he himself has said at various times, it looks as if he has grand ambitions to change the status quo on the peninsula.\u201d"]

["Journal Reports: Health Care", "While some of this variability is due to genetics, there is growing evidence that the 100 trillion organisms that live in the human gut\u2014known as the microbiome\u2014also play a role. Composed of more than 8,000 different types of bacteria, viruses and fungi living together in a complex ecosystem, the gut microbiome varies from person to person and is affected by a variety of factors, such as sleep, exercise, antibiotics use and, most important, diet.  Thanks to advances in genetic sequencing, researchers increasingly believe that these bacteria affect the body\u2019s ability to harvest energy from food, a measure known as the postprandial glucose response, or PPGR. If untreated, high blood glucose is a risk factor for a host of metabolic conditions, including obesity and diabetes.  DayTwo Inc., an Israeli startup, and Viome Inc., a company backed by Seattle entrepreneur Naveen Jain,  say they can help people normalize their blood sugar by analyzing the mix of bacteria that influence their glucose response. Customers send in a stool sample, from which their microbiome is sequenced, along with other information, including a brief medical history, daily activity levels and blood-test results. The companies send back individually tailored diets via an app designed to keep each person\u2019s blood-sugar levels balanced. Until now, most diets have been based on the glycemic index, a half-century-old list that ranks foods based on how they affect blood sugar. While this index is widely used by doctors to provide dietary advice, it is based on an average response and has been found wanting because many people aren\u2019t average."]
["Journal Reports: Health Care", "DayTwo, which charges $329 for its kit, bases its dietary recommendations on research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. In 2015 the institute produced a double-blind, peer-reviewed study that showed that individual glucose responses to the same exact meals varied dramatically. Using a test group of 800 people, the study showed that some people produce less glucose after eating a bowl of ice cream than they do after eating a portion of sushi, a food most people would consider to be more healthful. \u201cWe did a dietary intervention that showed that for different people, even people who were prediabetic, we could significantly lower their PPGR,\u201d says Eran Segal,  one of the Israeli researchers and a consultant to DayTwo. Until very recently, many doctors were hesitant to base any nutritional advice on the microbiome, saying researchers still didn\u2019t know what each type of micro-organism does exactly, how they interact with other bacteria, and whether they cause disease or are only a biomarker of disease. But Jack Gilbert,  faculty director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Microbiome Center, says he now believes it\u2019s possible to give some dietary advice based on microbiome analysis, even though the microbiome\u2019s role isn\u2019t fully understood. \u201cThis is less about trying to identify the particular mechanisms of the microbes and more about identifying the potential correlated association between the microbial communities and how they positively associate with blood-glucose levels and response to different types of food,\u201d he says. Dr. Gilbert, who isn\u2019t connected to DayTwo, says he has put his own father, who is prediabetic, on the program."]
["Journal Reports: Health Care", "The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which as recently as last year expressed reservations about microbiome-based diets, also has \u201cevolved\u201d its position, says Sonya Angelone,  a San Francisco nutritionist and a spokeswoman for the academy. \u201cI think this is the future of really good health care,\u201d says Ms. Angelone, though she suggests pairing such data with advice from a dietitian.   Rob Knight,  a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego, and faculty director of the university\u2019s Center for Microbiome Innovation, says the Weizmann research underlying DayTwo is \u201cvery solid and rigorous, which puts them ahead of the curve.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cI think it is still very challenging to extend results like that beyond the population you have studied directly.\u201d Perhaps because of these concerns, DayTwo, which bases its dietary advice on an algorithm licensed from the Weizmann Institute that connects microbiome composition with predicted glucose responses, has joined with Mayo Clinic to duplicate the Israeli study on 329 people in the U.S. The goal is to ensure that the diet advice works as well for Americans, whose genetics and diet are different from many Israelis.  Nicholas Chia,  assistant director of the Center for the Individualized Medicine Microbiome Program at Mayo Clinic, says the results of the follow-up study were close to the Weizmann\u2019s Institute\u2019s findings. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good sign that we\u2019ve replicated the Israeli study and that it continues to work,\u201d he says."]
["Journal Reports: Health Care", "Viome, meanwhile, uses gene-sequencing technology to analyze not only bacteria but also viruses and fungi in the gut. The Bellevue, Wash., firm, which charges $399 for its analysis, compares users\u2019 microbiomes with 800 individuals the company has preselected as healthy specimens. It gives broad advice on foods to eat or avoid to improve glucose response, enhance sleep and focus, and reduce anxiety. Though Mr. Jain says Viome\u2019s sequencing technology, licensed from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, is superior to other technologies, Viome\u2019s dietary advice isn\u2019t yet based on peer-reviewed research. Mr. Jain says Viome is conducting a microbiome study on 2,000 people that should be completed later this year.  Drs. Gilbert and Knight and Ms. Angelone declined to discuss Viome, saying they hadn\u2019t seen its studies. A spokesman for Viome says hundreds of testimonials are evidence that Viome\u2019s service is working. Other companies, including uBiome Inc., the American Gut project and Biohm also offer sequencing of the microbiome, but they focus on how an individual\u2019s gut bacteria differ from the average, not on helping people understand which foods elevate their blood glucose. Some sell probiotics that they say improve the mix of bacteria, though many experts caution that the rapid growth in marketing and use of probiotics may have outpaced scientific research for many of their proposed uses and benefits. \u201cAlthough some probiotics have shown promise in research studies, strong scientific evidence to support specific uses of probiotics for most health conditions is lacking,\u201d the National Institutes of Health says."]
["Journal Reports: Health Care", "As for microbiome-based diets, questions remain. Can these eating plans change a person\u2019s gut bacteria for the better, and if so, do people need to measure how much it has changed? \u201cThe right diet might change over time as the bacteria change,\u201d says Dr. Knight at UC San Diego. Viome includes a follow-up analysis as part of its annual fee; DayTwo has decided to wait for further studies to determine whether the changes in the microbiome are so significant that the microbiome needs to be assessed once more.

["Education", " Small liberal arts colleges will likely be hit disproportionately because many\u00a0have sizable endowments but limited enrollment. The tax applies\u00a0only\u00a0to private schools with at least 500 students and at least $500,000\u00a0of investments\u00a0per student.  The change was driven by congressional Republicans, who say colleges building up large, tax-favored endowments should use more of that money to reduce tuition and support low-income students. Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill. The criteria were meant to ensure that universities with the largest endowments, including Harvard University, Yale University and Stanford University, will pay the tax. The investment-per-student threshold was raised to $500,000 in the final tax bill after colleges complained to their representatives about a lower cutoff included in earlier versions. The tax will raise $1.8 billion over a decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  Schools have continued to protest the move, saying they often use endowment earnings to provide financial aid and warning that diverting funds to pay the new tax will only make it harder to do what GOP lawmakers want. The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York hopes to eventually resume letting students attend without paying tuition, a century-old tradition it abandoned under financial stress in 2014. The college, which expects to pay the tax, currently covers half-tuition for all undergraduates."]
["Education", "\u201cThe new tax-reform plan has the potential to make that return to free tuition much more difficult,\u201d said President\u00a0Laura Sparks in a statement.  Although it still isn\u2019t clear exactly how the endowment tax will be calculated, the provision appears to create a system of winners and losers that could alter how schools grow, invest and spend. The wealthiest schools, such as Harvard and Princeton University, will definitely pay, while the smallest and least wealthy schools won\u2019t.  Some wealthy universities will probably avoid the tax in the near-term. Columbia, New York University, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt University and Johns Hopkins University all have endowments over $3 billion. But their endowments fall below the $500,000-per-student threshold because they have so many students, federal data show.  Columbia\u2019s endowment, for example, was worth about $326,000 per student at the end of 2016.\u00a0The university has about 9,000 undergraduates and more than 23,000 graduate and professional students. But small liberal arts colleges like Claremont McKenna College, in Claremont, Calif., Berea College, in Berea, Ky., and Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine\u2014all with endowments of about $1.5 billion or less\u2014are likely to pay. With the $500,000 figure fixed, more schools are expected to be included in future years. Hamilton College, in Clinton, N.Y., where the endowment just hit $1 billion, is likely to just\u00a0surpass\u00a0the $500,000 endowment-per-student threshold,\u00a0the school says. That will trigger\u00a0a tax bill of about $500,000, out of a $180 million annual budget."]
["Education", "The tax includes no brackets, making it an all-or-nothing proposition for schools on the cusp.\u00a0That could push colleges like Hamilton, with about 1,865 students, to consider increasing enrollment\u00a0to stay under that $500,000 threshold. \u201cThe most logical thing is to look at enrollment,\u201d said Karen Leach,  Hamilton\u2019s vice president for administration and finance.\u00a0\u201cBut there\u2019s other things to consider. I don\u2019t have any housing to put them in.\u201d Meanwhile, schools that meet the $500,000-per-student endowment threshold but have fewer than 500 students will be penalized if they add too many students. Principia College, a liberal arts college in Elsah, Ill., has about 440 students this year, and President Jonathan Palmer said hitting 500 students would trigger a tax of between $500,000 and $600,000. \u201cWe feel that we have room for more students,\u201d Mr. Palmer said. \u201cAs we get closer to that 500 number, it\u2019s a challenge to say, \u2018Is that student worth $600,000?\u2019 \u201d Until the IRS and the Treasury Department provide guidance, it remains uncertain which\u00a0investment assets will be taxed. The agencies are expected to define the \u201cassets which are used directly in carrying out the institution\u2019s exempt purpose,\u201d which the law exempts from being used to calculate endowment size. \u201cWe would argue that there\u2019s nothing that we generate that\u2019s not used to carry out the institution\u2019s educational purposes,\u201d said Stephen Briggs,  president of Berry College in northwest Georgia, which expects to pay the tax in the near future."]
["Education", "Even if schools can\u2019t stay out of the tax, they will have incentives to minimize their annual investment income and thus their tax bill. That could mean waiting to realize gains, harvesting losses and engaging in other behavior that tax-exempt institutions don\u2019t always concern themselves with. \u201cOne thing that we should probably expect to see is for colleges and universities to act more like other taxpayers,\u201d said Brian Galle,  a tax law professor at Georgetown University. Republicans say the tax mirrors a levy on private foundations and puts colleges on notice that Congress is watching how they use funds subsidized with charitable deductions and tax exemptions. \u201cThe goal is pretty simple: It encourages colleges to use their major endowments to lower the cost of education,\u201d said Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But as written, the law doesn\u2019t directly reward colleges for lowering costs, reducing tuition or providing more financial aid\u2014unless they spend down their endowment below the $500,000 per student threshold.\u00a0  Rep. Tom Reed (R., N.Y.), said Congress could use future legislation to dangle new incentives before schools. The government, he said, could \u201csuspend this tax so long as\u00a0your\u00a0returns on your investments are going to tuition reduction for working families\u201d and there is disclosure about spending. For now, schools are preparing to pay. Alexandra Day,  a Juilliard spokeswoman, said the school\u2019s tax liability could be between $500,000 and $1.5 million."]

["Capital Account", "Recent flaps over Russian political manipulation and the unauthorized release of data to Cambridge Analytica aren\u2019t Facebook\u2019s first. In 2007, it was over the news feed of ads and information a user encountered when logging in, and its Beacon service that shared user activity with third-party sites and other users; Facebook modified both in response.  In 2009, it changed its terms of service so that it could use any data users had uploaded for any purpose. In response to protests, Facebook reverted to the old terms. In 2011, it settled Federal Trade Commission charges of promising users they could keep their information private, then, the FTC said, \u201crepeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.\u201d None had any discernible impact on Facebook\u2019s user growth. That wasn\u2019t unusual. Researchers have found that companies seldom pay a price for privacy scandals. A 2006 study co-authored by Alessandro Acquisti,  an economist specializing in privacy at Carnegie Mellon University, found disclosure of a privacy breach on average led to a stock drop of just 0.6%. There are several explanations for the lack of economic consequences. One is that the services and products people get in return for their data far exceeds the annoyance or worries about privacy. Indeed, the more information customers surrender, the more useful the ads and products they are offered are likely to be."]
["Capital Account", "The other is that the costs of invading privacy aren\u2019t easily quantified, or borne by the company. A customer whose information has been hacked or sold may never be a victim of identity theft. You might be denied a job, arrested or deported some day because of your social-media history, but people seldom build such remote risks into their decisions today. Some people feel creeped out being tracked by advertisers or co-opted by odious political causes, but can\u2019t put a price on those feelings.   \u201cThe economic proposition is opaque,\u201d says Mr. Acquisti. \u201cWe can agree consumers are getting value back. It\u2019s hard to estimate the cost to privacy, and how much value the companies who manage the data are getting from it.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say companies like Facebook are indifferent to\u00a0privacy concerns. Facebook does self-regulate by adhering to the privacy practices of the Digital Advertising Alliance, an industry group. And the economic costs of privacy violations appear to be growing, potentially raising the incentive to act. Last fall credit-reporting service\n            Equifax\n Inc.\n      lost a third of its market value and its chief executive after disclosing an extensive data breach. Like Facebook, Equifax makes money by collecting and analyzing data about people. Unlike Facebook, Equifax also operates under several federal laws that expose it to significant legal risk; multiple federal, state and foreign regulators are investigating the breach. It also has competitors to whom disgruntled customers, such as banks, can turn. "]
["Capital Account", "What exactly is Facebook? It depends on when you asked Mark Zuckerberg. To see how Facebook became an election-influencing player, we dug into the archives and looked at the company's changing view of itself. Photo Illustration: Heather Seidel/The Wall Street Journal; Photos: Associated Press Facebook has suffered much less from its data scandal because the data is less sensitive, the potential harm far less, and the relationship with consumers less coercive: you can easily delete your Facebook account but not your Equifax file. But it is also because Facebook has fewer competitors to worry about. \u200bAsked Tuesday if Facebook has a monopoly, Mr. Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\u201d Advertisers and users probably feel differently. \u201cIt\u2019s not like if you don\u2019t like Facebook you can go next door and use someone else\u2019s social-networking services,\u201d says Marc Rotenberg,  president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group critical of Facebook. Those who wanted more privacy once had WhatsApp, a messaging service that promised not to use their data to sell ads. Then, in 2014, Facebook bought WhatsApp. \u201cWhat was Facebook interested in? The personal data of the WhatsApp users,\u201d says Mr. Rotenberg. \u201cBut those users had provided that to a company with better privacy protections than Facebook.\u201d In 2016, WhatsApp began sharing user data with Facebook."]
["Capital Account", "Unregulated monopolies are seldom left that way. Critics who think Facebook is too big have struggled to make an antitrust case against a company that offers an expanding array of services for free. Privacy might provide an alternative rationale: customers \u201cpay\u201d for Facebook by offering up personal information, and they might have to pay less (i.e. offer less information) if competing platforms were around. That, however, targets a company rather than a behavior, says Mr. Acquisti. Instead, he says it would be better to implement privacy protection across all companies that maintains the genuine benefits that data sharing makes possible\u2014which will require regulation. \u201cWe cannot trust these companies to do it, not because they are bad companies, but because the incentive for deep data collection and usage are so powerful, and the alternatives for consumers are so few,\u201d says Mr. Acquisti.

The company declined to comment further, and Mr. Wu couldn\u2019t be reached. Mr. Wu isn\u2019t the first prominent Chinese financier to drop from sight. Tomorrow Group\u2019s Xiao Jianhua has been missing since January. Hong Kong police and his businesses say he crossed the border into mainland China and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. His businesses say they have no information about him, and Chinese authorities haven\u2019t commented. Fosun Group\u2019s Guo Guangchang vanished briefly in late 2015 to help authorities with what the company later said were investigations. It spooked investors at the time, but there has been little apparent impact on Fosun after his re-emergence."]
["China News", "A Chinese property mogul living in the U.S., Guo Wengui, has focused attention on the issue by making sweeping allegations of corrupt links between China\u2019s business and political elites, including high-ranking party officials. Mr. Guo, a billionaire with ties to a former deputy chief of China\u2019s domestic spy agency, has offered scant evidence. Chinese authorities have described Mr. Guo as a \u201ccriminal suspect\u201d and dismissed his claims as falsehoods, while the tycoon has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Wu\u2019s detention comes at a sensitive time for Mr. Xi, who has emphasized economic and financial stability for China ahead of the fall leadership meeting. If insurers like Anbang run into trouble\u2014either corruption or business problems\u2014investors could demand their money back, leaving the companies, which have invested in long-term assets such as real estate, struggling to raise for cash to repay short-term investors. The big risk for the Chinese leadership is that a company failure could set off a domino effect in a financial system struggling with high debt. So far there is no evidence of that happening, and a market selloff in reaction to Wednesday\u2019s Anbang news was limited to stocks in the company\u2019s portfolio.  Mr. Wu was detained by a joint team of antigraft investigators and police officers specializing in economic crimes, said the people familiar with the matter. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption watchdog, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment."]
["China News", "In building Anbang, Mr. Wu was aggressive and detail-oriented, said people who have done business with him. \u201cHe\u2019s very hands-on, very quick in decision making,\u201d said the head of an Anbang-controlled European company who sees Mr. Wu a few times a year in Beijing. Anbang claims assets approaching $300 billion. The structure of the company is complex, and it has no key business units listed on a stock exchange. That keeps Mr. Wu off lists of the country\u2019s richest tycoons. \u201cThe shareholder structure is so obscured that it\u2019s impossible to see who owns it,\u201d says Rupert Hoogewerf,  who runs a Shanghai wealth-tracking service called Hurun Report. After a string of takeovers following the global financial crisis, Anbang shot to international recognition in 2014 when it agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy New York\u2019s historic Waldorf Astoria hotel from\n        Hilton Worldwide Holdings\n Inc.\n      President Xi stayed in the hotel for the following year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly.

Anbang\u2019s $1.5 billion bid to take control of Iowa-based\n        Fidelity & Guaranty Life\n          \n      unraveled after it failed to win approval from New York insurance regulators, who had found Anbang\u2019s answers about shareholders and funding insufficient, according to people involved and official statements. Disclosure was also an issue for the multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. when it looked at the bid, according to a person familiar with the situation."]
["China News", "Last year, Anbang and its partners walked away from a $14 billion bid to buy Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. In March, New York real-estate developer Kushner Cos. said it had ceased talks with Anbang for a planned $7.5 billion redevelopment of a mixed-use skyscraper in Manhattan. Jared Kushner,  a senior White House official and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had been running the family-controlled Kushner business before last year\u2019s election. Anbang was one of China\u2019s fastest-growing insurance companies. The insurance sector came under scrutiny late last year after many insurers increased their investments in risky assets and became aggressive buyers in the equity market. Chinese insurers held about $175 billion in deposits associated with universal-life policies at the end of 2016, more than triple the amount two years earlier, according to the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.  Mr. Wu\u2019s aggressiveness was exhibited in Anbang\u2019s efforts to change how insurance is sold in China. Instead of offering commissions to agents who sell home and life coverage, Anbang pulled in revenue through banks and online platforms by selling products called universal life that function more like short-term deposits than insurance policies. The Anbang chairman defended his company\u2019s foreign-investment strategy in an interview published by state-owned Beijing News earlier this year, a time of insurance-sector turmoil that included a 10-year ban for a competitor and the toppling of the top regulator.  The interview showed Mr. Wu still in control of Anbang, but signaling his willingness to get in step with government priorities by pursuing more traditional business lines such as pensions, which he called its \u201cnew starting point.\u201d"]

In the ad, factory workers read out: \u201cThanks to you, we\u2019re winning again. But tariffs on steel would change all that.\u201d"]
["Business", "The bid is one of the more notable efforts that manufacturers are making in their rush to escape or blunt the impact of the tariffs. Some makers of construction equipment and cans say they have yet to figure out the Department of Commerce\u2019s process for seeking exemptions and whether they should apply.  The new duties\u201425% on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminum\u2014are expected to go into effect Friday, but the Commerce Department plans to field requests for exemptions over the next 90 days. Officials have signaled they will grant exclusions only sparingly and based on national-security concerns. The Trump administration said Wednesday it has been in close talks with several allies and trading partners about exempting the countries from the new tariffs.   Companies have to go through a separate process that some so far have found confusing. \u201cWe don\u2019t even understand how we\u2019d apply for it, and whether it would be effective or not, and how it would work,\u201d said Rich Goldsbury, president of construction equipment maker\n            Doosan Bobcat\n            \n      in Fargo, N.D. One major U.S. manufacturer may decline to even seek an exemption because the process could require divulging too much proprietary information, a person familiar with the matter said. The Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade group representing companies that use metals to make food and beverage containers, is trying to request an exemption as a group rather than individual companies."]
["Business", "\u201cMy fear is [the department] may find our industry filing nearly 1,500 applications in the coming days, overwhelming [department] staff with exclusion requests,\u201d Robert Budway,  the institute\u2019s president, wrote in a letter to the Commerce Department. The exemptions are part of a longer-term lobbying and diplomatic effort underway to carve out exemptions from the broad tariffs, which Mr. Trump ordered be put in place earlier this month. Other manufacturers may be less worried about the tariffs if steel and aluminum aren\u2019t key raw materials or if they can find ways to offset higher metal costs. A Commerce Department spokesman said exemptions would apply to companies and specific products, not trade groups or associations. There were 13 steel exclusion requests and four for aluminum, the spokesman said late Wednesday. Proprietary information would be kept confidential under law, he added. As for any confusion, the Commerce spokesman said there are various avenues to field company questions: \u201cThe Department has a readily accessible electronic process for submission of exclusion requests, and has multiple online and telephonic resources to give applicants guidance on the process.\u201d Manufacturers are also weighing how to deal with the tariffs once they go into effect\u00a0Friday. Heavy-machinery maker\n            Caterpillar\n Inc.\n      expects to pay more for steel this year but thinks it will be able to mitigate the impact of higher costs\u2014including those related to tariffs\u2014with procurement strategies and pricing, Caterpillar\u2019s director of investor relations Amy Campbell said this week."]
["Business", "\u201cWe do definitely see some risk,\u201d Ms. Campbell said at a conference. \u201cWe talked about just steel and generally tariffs would complicate that, but I think there are a lot of things that we\u2019re doing to limit the impacts of that.\u201d Other manufacturers don\u2019t know yet how tariffs will affect their long-term decisions on where to shift or invest in production, given that the trade barriers would increase costs on imported metals and also drive up domestic prices. \u201cThis is adding another layer of uncertainty,\u201d Todd Stucke,  a senior vice president at Kubota Tractor Corp. in Dallas. \u201cEverything\u2019s unclear now.\u201d Kip Eideberg, a lobbyist for the Association of Equipment Manufacturers that bought the ad for airing on the Fox network shows, said the groups\u2019 members are hoping a message delivered by factory workers would persuade Mr. Trump to reverse course. \u201cWe know the president cares a lot about his supporters,\u201d Mr. Eideberg said. \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article.

But the country remains divided between dozens of militias and two rival governments to the GNA. Mr. Sanallah said the GNA was trying to wrest control of petroleum deals from the National Oil Co., of which he is chairman. The company generates 90% of Libya\u2019s export revenue and is state owned but says it is maintaining its independence from various factions vying to run the country until elections are held."]

The government argued that the UN-backed agreement that created the GNA implied it would takeover the oil industry. The National Oil Co. is challenging the decree in Libya\u2019s courts. The company has tried to steer a neutral course between the country\u2019s competing, often violent factions, and argues the GNA is a caretaker government until a constitution uniting the country is agreed to.

There has also been renewed fighting around Libya\u2019s oil ports, which were opened last year by a group calling itself the Libya National Army, led by a former Gadhafi general, Khalifa Haftar,  who is supported by Egypt and Russia. Mr. Sanallah said the country\u2019s oil production had fallen to 491,000 barrels a day, down from nearly 700,000 barrels a day earlier this year.

According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Sanallah was upset about payments the GNA made to convince militias to stop blockading some oil facilities.

Those expectations are pushing up bond yields in the developed world and lessening the attractiveness of emerging markets, where investors take on greater risk for comparatively richer yields.  Investors are closely watching the moves in emerging markets as a barometer for how other popular risky investments, such as high yield-debt, will react to a shift in global monetary policy.

["Business", "Akorn, which generated sales of $1.1 billion last year, makes generic pharmaceuticals such as nasal sprays, inhalants and over-the-counter eye-care treatments. In addition to the U.S., it has manufacturing facilities in Switzerland and India. At the end of 2015, it employed about 2,200 people world-wide.  For Fresenius, such a deal would come just months after its largest-ever acquisition: a \u20ac5.76 billion ($6.1 billion) acquisition of Spanish hospital operator IDC Salud Holding SLU in September last year, shortly after Chief Executive Stephan Sturmtook the helm.

["Markets Main", "The Labor Department\u2019s new fiduciary rule, set to take effect in April, holds advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings to a \u201cfiduciary\u201d standard, meaning they must work in the best interest of their clients and generally avoid conflicts. Previously, advisers were required to offer only \u201csuitable\u201d guidance, a less-rigorous standard. The changes are widely expected to be a boon for passively managed index funds that track markets instead of trying to beat them. Those funds are typically cheaper than funds run by managers who bet on individual stocks and bonds.

["Markets Main", "The discounts are part of a broader reduction in the price of investing as firms increasingly undercut each other on price and fight for price-sensitive clients. Over the last 12 months, $437.3 billion has flowed into passive funds, according to Morningstar, while investors have yanked $303.34 billion from actively managed funds.

["World News", "\u201cMajor combat operations against terrorist groups in Syria are coming to an end,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cI note that thanks to these efforts, Russia, Iran and Turkey managed to prevent the collapse of Syria, to prevent its capture by terrorists, to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.\u201d The three countries have backed warring parties in the Syrian civil war and have intervened directly in the conflict. Moscow and Tehran are allies in Syria, with Iran providing advisers and foot soldiers and Russia providing air power to support the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  In contrast, Ankara has supported rebel groups seeking to oust Mr. Assad, as well as deploying forces inside Syria.  The three countries have found common ground in recent months, backing peace negotiations sponsored in the Kazakh capital, Astana, and agreeing on \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d on the ground in Syria.  In parallel, Mr. Putin has launched an intense round of diplomacy that appears aimed at laying a foundation for a negotiated settlement that favors Mr. Assad. The Kremlin has cast the Syrian president\u2019s visit to Mr. Putin earlier this week in triumphant terms. Mr. Putin followed up with phone calls to President Donald Trump,  King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other regional leaders to discuss prospects for a settlement. Images on Russian state television Wednesday portrayed a grand effort to end the Syrian conflict, despite ongoing violence there. The Sochi summit comes ahead of a fresh round of United Nations-led negotiations in Geneva. "]
["World News", "In recent months, Moscow has taken on an increasingly dominant role in mediating an end to the conflict and positioned itself as a regional power broker, overshadowing U.N. talks. Much of the progress made in reducing the violence in Syria came out of the Astana meetings.

Observers say the Sochi conference signals Moscow\u2019s determination to\u00a0mold Syria\u2019s future in favor of Mr. Assad. On Monday, several prominent members of the opposition, including lead negotiator Riyad Hijab, resigned from the main opposition negotiating body, leaving it uncertain who would represent the opposition delegation next week in Geneva.

["Africa News", "\u201cDuring the period of military rule, the north monopolized power,\u201d said Jideofor Adibe, an associate professor of political science at Nasarawa State University in Keffi, Nigeria. \u201cThat created a lot of animosity in the south.\u201d Still, Mr. Adibe added that the north feels as though \u201cthey are left with nothing\u201d if the south has the presidency. \u201cYou get this competitive anger,\u201d he said. President Muhammadu Buhari has spent 70 days and counting in London this year, undergoing unspecified medical treatment. When he first left in January for what was billed as a 10-day vacation, Nigeria was in the throes of its worst recession in three decades amid a dollar shortage that was driving away investment and a revived insurgency in the oil-rich Niger Delta region. Before he left on May 7 for his second visit to the British capital this year, 74-year-old Mr. Buhari missed several cabinet meetings and looked gaunt in public. Nigerian Vice President Oluyemi Osinbajo, seen in March, has overseen policies that have stabilized the country\u2019s oil-producing region.Photo: pius utomi ekpei/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Ahead of each departure, Mr. Buhari signed over power to Vice President Oluyemi Osinbajo. While in charge, Mr. Osinbajo, a lawyer and a pastor, has ushered in a new foreign-exchange policy designed to infuse dollar liquidity into the market and sealed a cease-fire with militants in the Niger Delta. That has stabilized the oil-producing region, which accounts for about 95% of the country\u2019s export revenue. At points last year, pipeline vandalism was costing the country about a million barrels of oil a day."]
["Africa News", "The country\u2019s foreign-currency crisis has also abated, with the official airport-kiosk rate of 380 naira to the U.S. dollar matching the black-market rate one recent afternoon in Abuja. In February, informal money-changers charged as much as 520 naira for a dollar. \u201cThe acting president is doing an excellent job,\u201d said Olayemi Haruna, a grocer in the capital Abuja. With no indication of Mr. Buhari\u2019s condition or when he may return, speculation is rife that Nigeria\u2014which enjoyed its first democratic transition of power in 2015\u2014might see a repeat of the 2010 death-in-office of then-President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2014and the turmoil that followed. \u201cWill he survive this year? I doubt it,\u201d said Boniface Chizea, chief executive at BIC Consultancy Services in Lagos. \u201cYou look at him, you know he\u2019s terminally ill.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Buhari didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment. Under Nigeria\u2019s constitution, if Mr. Buhari dies or steps down, Mr. Osinbajo, 60, will assume office. Although many analysts agree that Mr. Osinbajo has performed impressively, they fear that his religion and origin\u2014he is a Christian from southern Nigeria, while Mr. Buhari is Muslim and hails from the north\u2014could spur political infighting and put the continued recovery of Africa\u2019s leading oil producer in jeopardy. \u201cThere are those who are prepared to work hard to make [Mr. Buhari] stay on as president, even if he is a vegetable,\u201d BIC\u2019s Mr. Chizea said."]
["Africa News", "Other analysts and academics say that, ideally, Mr. Osinbajo should finish out Mr. Buhari\u2019s term and then step down, but there is no law preventing him from running again in 2019. The result could be an extended period of infighting, and potentially, interference by the military, which propped up many northern rulers during the dictatorships of the 1980s and \u201990s. Those concerns highlight the threats to democracy in a country where the power of the ballot is far from established.  \u201cIn a fragile nation like ours, the law has to operate in a political context,\u201d Dr. Adibe said. \u201cEverything now is in a state of suspense.\u201d Mr. Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s illness\u2014and its coverup by his advisers\u2014paralyzed the government while the jihadist Boko Haram insurgency began to take hold across Nigeria\u2019s northeast. In the end, Mr. Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s vice president, Goodluck Jonathan,  a Christian from the south, finished Mr. Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s term and then served another before losing to Mr. Buhari in 2015. \u201cThe north doesn\u2019t want what happened with Jonathan to happen again,\u201d said Cyril Uchenna Gwam, chief executive of Emerson Consulting Nigeria. \u201cIn Nigeria, we hide health issues\u2014it\u2019s part of our custom.

["Business", "The deal, the latest in a wave of consolidation in the drug industry, combines Teva, the world\u2019s largest generic-drug company by sales, with the third-largest competitor in the market. The acquisition will give Teva increased scale in the hotly competitive generic-drug market, and an opportunity to pursue further cost reductions that could help it cope with the end of a wave of big patent expirations. \u201cWhat we are doing here will enable Teva to be one of the winners of the ever-changing pharmaceutical industry,\u201d Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman said in an interview. He expects Teva will be able to divest the products needed to satisfy any government concerns about antitrust. Teva shares rose 12% to $69.35 in midday trading. Mr. Vigodman added that Teva would drop its pursuit of rival\n            Mylan\n            \n      NV in wake of its agreement to buy Allergan\u2019s generic-drugs business. \u201cWe believe we have an even greater opportunity to create value for shareholders from\u201d the Allergan transaction, he said. Teva said it plans to review its options with respect to the approximately 4.6% of Mylan stock that it owns. Mylan, in a separate statement, congratulated Teva, said its focus remains unchanged and reaffirmed its commitment to acquiring rival\n            Perrigo\n Co.\n      So far, Perrigo has rebuffed Mylan\u2019s takeover attempts."]
["Business", "Mylan shares fell nearly 14% to $57.03 Monday, while Perrigo gained 3.8% to $193.67. For Allergan, the Teva deal provides it with cash to pay down debt and allows the company to focus more on lucrative brand-name drugs. Actavis was renamed Allergan earlier this year, after doing $100 billion in deals last year that gave it brand-name drugs, notably wrinkle fighter Botox. Those deals had swollen Allergan\u2019s debt levels, and the company has said it is committed to reducing its debt levels. Allergan shares added 7.3% to $330.64.  Mylan Scolded for \u2018Wealth-Destroying Decisions\u2019. Cowen & Co. has harsh words for generic-drug maker Mylan in its downgrade of the stock to \u201cmarket perform\u201d from \u201coutperform,\u201d saying the company appears set \u201cto persist in making wealth-destroying decisions.\u201d Teva\u2019s decision to abandon a takeover of Mylan\u2014which Mylan had fought\u2014in favor of buying Allergan\u2019s generic business creates \u201charsh realities\u201d for Mylan shares, Cowen says. Mylan\u2019s pursuit of rival Perrigo, which Perrigo has resisted, may not create value at prices above $205 per share. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)  Teva, Allergan Will Both Be Able to Reorganize. Teva\u2019s deal for Allergan\u2019s generic-drug business will be an opportunity for both to simplify their sprawling organizations and potentially cut costs. Teva, which makes 64 billion tablets and capsules/year, has been trying to reorganize amid a belt-tightening effort under CEO Erez Vigodman, he notes to WSJ, and the company expects $1.4 billion in yearly synergies from the Allergan transaction. Meantime, Allergan will simplify its footprint by focusing on higher-growth branded drugs; for instance, it will go from running 40 manufacturing plants to 12, according to a company slide. (jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com; @jonathanrockoff) "]
["Business", " Teva-Allergan Buy Likely Heralds More Big Deals Teva\u2019s acquisition of Allergan\u2019s generic-drugs unit for $40.5 billion is likely to trigger more deal-making in the already-frenzied health-care sector. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said investors had highlighted AbbVie, Amgen, Pfizer and Biogen as potential transaction partners. \u201cAllergan clearly spells interest in using this case for acquisitions,\u201d he said. (denise.roland@wsj.com; @deniseroland)  Market Talk is a stream of real-time news and market analysis that is available on Dow Jones Newswires.  Teva said it expected the acquisition of Allergan Generics to contribute $2.7 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, in 2016, excluding synergies. It expects to achieve cost synergies and tax savings of approximately $1.4 billion annually, largely achievable by the third anniversary of the closing of the transaction. Allergan\u2019s 1,000 low-price products include branded generic drugs, over-the-counter medicines and generic versions of well-known pharmaceuticals such as the OxyContin pain treatment and Concerta, which treats attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder. The deal is expected to attract antitrust scrutiny from regulators. Teva may need to sell off products with about $500 million in yearly sales to win approval, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat estimates. Teva said the transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016."]
["Business", "Midsize companies such as Teva have largely driven the breakneck pace of consolidation in the drug industry in recent years\u2014part of a broader boom in mergers and acquisitions\u2014as they take advantage of cheap debt and in some cases low tax rates secured by relocating overseas, while drawing on the approval of investors who have driven their shares higher. Meanwhile, bigger, more-established rivals have largely been on the sidelines of major deal making. Last year Teva, which had a market value of $60 billion before The Wall Street Journal reported Teva\u2019s talks with Allergan on Saturday, had $9.1 billion in generic-drug sales, according to EvaluatePharma, about 12% of the world market. The company said it already accounts for one in six drug prescriptions in the U.S. But much of its business is in no-name generic medicines sold at lower prices. Nearly half of Teva\u2019s $20.3 billion in sales last year were from the off-patent generic copies of drugs. By adding Allergan\u2019s business, which reported $6.6 billion in sales last year, Teva would have revenue significantly greater than that of better-known, branded-drug companies such as Cialis maker\n            Eli Lilly\n            \n      & Co., which reported $19.6 billion in sales last year. The deal could give the combined company a market value exceeding that of Lilly, which stood at $94 billion on Friday."]
["Business", "Teva also said Monday that it expected to report better-than-expected sales and earnings for the second quarter ended in June. The company projected earnings excluding certain items of $1.43 a share on revenue of $4.97 billion, down 2% from a year ago but up 6% excluding the impact from currency changes. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.31 a share on sales of $4.92 billion, according to FactSet. Teva will report its full second-quarter results on Thursday. For 2015, Teva raised its per-share earnings forecast to a range of $5.15 to $5.40, from its previous range of $5.05 to $5.35. Analysts were expecting per-share earnings of $5.20, according to FactSet. Dublin-based Allergan became one of the top 10 drug companies by sales this year when Actavis bought the maker of wrinkle treatment Botox for nearly $70 billion, and renamed itself. The Teva deal allows Allergan to sharpen its focus on its branded pharmaceutical business.   \u201cWe will have the potential to add scale in existing therapeutic areas, expand into new therapeutic areas and geographies and evaluate strategic transformational deals as we continue to build on our position as the most dynamic branded growth pharma company,\u201d Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said. In a sign of its continuing ambition, Allergan announced a deal on Sunday, saying it will pay $560 million upfront for Naurex Inc. and its antidepressant-drug candidate. \u2014Razak Musah Baba contributed to this article.

["Markets Main", "Mr. Wiseman has worked closely with BlackRock chief Laurence Fink in recent years on an initiative called Focusing Capital on the Long Term. That effort, backed by a number of large investors, promotes corporate governance and strategies focused on the long-term over initiatives aimed at boosting short-term earnings and stock-price gains.  The appointment adds muscle to BlackRock\u2019s alternatives business, an area it has tried to grow in recent years, and marks the latest step in a yearslong effort by BlackRock to improve performance in its actively managed equity funds. Earlier this year, the $4.7 trillion asset manager combined its traditional and quantitative equity funds into one group that it said in January would be managed by executives Chris Jones, Nigel Bolton, Raffaele Savi and Jeff Shen. Messrs. Bolton, Savi and Shen will now become co-chief investment officers of global active equity at the firm, while Mr. Jones is leaving \u201cto pursue other opportunities,\u201d a spokesman said.

Its assets increased by more than C$100 billion with Mr. Wiseman at the helm. The CPPIB executive\u2019s departure comes as the Canadian fund posted a 3.4% net investment gain for the fiscal year ended March 31, outperforming a 1% decline in the fund\u2019s internal benchmark. Canada\u2019s pension funds measure themselves against internal benchmarks because of their widespread exposure to public and private holdings."]
["Markets Main", "The performance against the benchmark \u201cwas by far the best ... the fund has ever had,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said Thursday.  CPPIB and Canada\u2019s other large pension funds have built reputations as being some of the biggest global investors, in part by establishing offices in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America for high-profile deals. The pension funds use their foreign locations to identify local partners and expertise to give them an edge in identifying potential investments. About 81% of CPPIB\u2019s assets are invested outside Canada. That includes its $12 billion acquisition last year of General Electric Co.\u2019s private-equity lending unit and its deal last month to acquire a 40% stake in the agricultural business of commodities giant Glencore PLC. During Mr. Wiseman\u2019s tenure as chief executive, CPPIB established offices in New York, Brazil and India.

These groups fit the profile of something that is \u201ca bit techy, a bit growthy,\u201d which investors are happy to back amid equity markets that are riding high despite a prevailing lack of conviction."]
["Heard on the Street", "IPOs have been thin on the ground globally this year, but more \u201ctechy, growth\u201d listings are coming. Innogy, the renewable-energy and retail-distribution arm of Germany\u2019s RWE, is due this year, while Gocompare.com, the insurance price-comparison website of the U.K.\u2019s esure, said it intended to float on Tuesday. Worldpay showed investor appetite remains good for such companies last week when its private-equity shareholders sold down another \u00a31 billion ($1.33 billion) worth of shares, just less than one-fifth of its market capitalization, and the stock only slipped about 2% in response. It is up more than 20% from its listing price. Nets promises slightly slower growth than Worldpay: revenues are forecast to rise 5% to 6% a year at Nets compared with about 10% for its bigger rival. However, the Danish group needs less investment in its technology and should pay down its debt faster, according to people close to the company. Nets expects a market capitalization of 26 billion to 32 billion Danish kroner ($3.9 billion to $4.8 billion) and aims to raise about 5.5 billion kroner in new money. Its owners will also sell up to twice as much again in existing shares. This would put Nets\u2019s enterprise value on a multiple of 14.5 to 17 times forecast 2016 earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, before special items such as the cost of the IPO. That compares with Worldpay\u2019s 15 times multiple and is ahead of U.S. rivals such as\n        Vantiv\n,\n      at about 12.5 times."]
["Heard on the Street", "So, Nets is aiming for a slightly rich valuation versus Worldpay, which itself looks potentially overvalued.

Over the last several months, Ball p\u00e8re has whirled himself into a one-man media tornado as a spokesperson for his point-guard son and the entire Ball brood. Let\u2019s just go over the LaVarlights: Ball claimed 19-year-old Lonzo, who has precisely zero minutes of professional basketball experience, is already a superior player to reigning back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player Steph Curry; he told USA Today that, in his own playing prime, he (LaVar\u2014not Lonzo) would have crushed Michael Jordan in a one-on-one contest; he picked a bizarre fight with LeBron James over who would prove to be the better basketball dad (Besides Lonzo, Ball has two other hoops-playing sons, LiAngelo and LaMelo, both in high school; James\u2019s kids are, uh, 12 and 9). LaVar also appeared as a celebrated guest on sports TV asylums like FS1\u2019s \u201cUndisputed\u201d and ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take,\u201d where he\u2026well, he fit in perfectly. "]
["Jason Gay", "\n The rest of the sports media, it seems, is amid a prolonged and contradictory concern spasm over LaVar Ball, doing that time-honored maneuver in which it blasts someone for craving attention\u2014while lavishing him with more attention. (The college-basketball shouter Dick Vitale recently named Ball to his \u201cAll-Wacko Team,\u201d which, though I love me some Dickie V., is like having Cap\u2019n Crunch blast your breakfast as unhealthy.) The consensus anxiety is that LaVar\u2019s unfiltered talk is damaging Lonzo\u2019s potential as a player and a business\u2014that Dad is turning off sponsors, and perhaps even teams. That belief peaked a couple of weeks back with an ESPN report that apparel companies\n            Nike\n,\n      Adidas and Under Armour passed on signing Lonzo\u2014reportedly because LaVar insisted, among other demands, that the companies enter a licensing agreement with LaVar\u2019s own, existing apparel line, Big Baller Brand. \u201cInspired by the 3 Ball brothers from Chino Hills, California,\u201d as its website says, Big Baller Brand currently makes hats, T-shirts and other casual wear that Turtle would have worn 10 years ago on an episode of \u201cEntourage.\u201d"]
["Jason Gay", "If you thought the shoe mafia\u2019s public rebuke would shame LaVar Ball, think again. Late last week, he grandly announced the upcoming release of Lonzo\u2019s own shoe, the ZO2 Prime, which would be made not by Nike or Adidas or any existing shoemaker, but exclusively by Big Baller Brand. Alas, it is not a handsome shoe. Black with gold highlights, low cut, and absent of any noticeable footwear innovation, it is mostly an aesthetic challenger to reigning shoe Ishtar,  Curry\u2019s notorious Under Armour Chef 2 Lows. If the bland, white Chef 2 Lows were mocked as basketball sneakers for an assisted living home, the ZO2s look like something Frankenstein\u2019s monster might wear to a wake.  Oh there\u2019s also this: a pair of ZO2s cost $495. Did I mention this is a pair of basketball sneakers named for a player who has yet to play in the NBA? ZO2 shoes from Big Baller Brand. Photo: Big Baller Brand Predictably, social media set upon the ZO2 Prime like a fresh carcass, mocking LaVar\u2019s hubris, the shoe\u2019s design and, above all else, its spectacular price. Shaquille O\u2019Nealscolded LaVar for price gouging young consumers. \u201cReal Big Baller Brands don\u2019t overcharge kids for shoes,\u201d the NBA Hall of Famer wrote on Twitter. When Golden State Warriors interim coach Mike Brown was asked if he\u2019d buy a pair of $500 sneakers for his children, he burst into a fit of gleeful laughter. None of this seemed to bother LaVar, who tweeted \u201cif you can\u2019t afford the ZO2\u2019s, you\u2019re NOT a BIG BALLER.\u201d"]
["Jason Gay", "On and on it will go, presumably at least until Lonzo is picked early in the NBA Draft on June 22\u2014in the tastiest scenario, to Ball\u2019s hometown team, the Lakers. Will The LaVar Show impact where Lonzo\u2019s picked? Probably not. Both ESPN and the New York Daily News sniffed around; neither found a\n            GM\n            \n      who indicated, even privately, that Dad has turned them off from his son. As for the apparel companies, it\u2019s unusual for rookies to get big shoe contracts these days, anyway, and it\u2019s hard to believe that if Lonzo matures into a star, they won\u2019t come running back.  Also: allow me a moment to roll my eyes at the suggestion of the sneaker companies seizing the moral high ground here. While LaVar\u2019s approach sounds absurd, is it really a sin to want to hard-line or disrupt Nike or Adidas? As the former NBA player turned Chinese star and apparel maker Stephon Marbury argued, creating his own brand equity is exactly what Ball should be doing. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything that he is saying,\u201d Marbury told the Undefeated, \u201cbut I understand.\u201d Let\u2019s not ignore that apparel companies are attention-seeking disrupters themselves, whether it\u2019s seeding amateur leagues with sponsorships, or dressing college teams like Marvel characters. Didn\u2019t Nike just spend the other night trying to shatter the 2-hour barrier in marathon running with a brand-tastic spectacle featuring an automoblie test track, pace rabbits, and, of course, new show tech, a stunt that shook up the distance running establishment\u2014and, by the way, turned out to be brilliantly riveting? There\u2019s no need to be holy about an industry that itself is relentless about flouting convention. "]

It is indeed possible there will come a time when Lonzo will ask LaVar to step aside for the velvet touch of a professional\u2014perhaps, within a season or two, Big Baller will be mothballered and Lonzo will be in the comfortable fold of a legacy brand, selling basketball sneakers reasonably priced at\u2026$175. Until then, Lonzo, a quiet kid, seems content to stick with family.  As for the rest of us, there\u2019s a simple option: stop paying attention.

At\u00a06:03 p.m.,\u00a0regulators cut power to 90,000 Adelaide homes to prevent a wider blackout."]
["World News", "Resource-rich Australia has an energy crisis, one that offers lessons for America as it prepares to vastly increase natural-gas shipments abroad.  Australia now exports so much liquefied natural gas, or LNG, it may overtake No. 1 exporter Qatar within several years. It exported 62% of its gas production last year, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Yet its policy makers didn\u2019t ensure enough gas would remain at home. As exports increased from new LNG facilities in eastern Australia, some state governments let aging coal plants close and accelerated a push toward renewable energy for environmental concerns. That left the regions more reliant on gas for power, especially when intermittent sources such as wind and solar weren\u2019t sufficient. Shortages drove domestic gas prices earlier this year in some markets in eastern Australia to as high as $17 per million British thermal\u00a0units for smaller gas users such as manufacturers. On the spot market, gas prices have gone from below $1 in 2014 to roughly $7 today\u2014well above the roughly $3 that prevails in the U.S.\u2014causing havoc around the country. In March, Australia\u2019s largest aluminum smelter cut production and laid off workers because it said it couldn\u2019t secure enough cheap energy. During one blackout last year, some families lost embryos in an in-vitro-fertilization clinic with no backup generation, according to a government-commissioned report. In February, some tuna fishermen watched catches rot because freezers shut off."]
["World News", "The blackouts have been severe enough to catch the attention of\n            Tesla\n Inc.\n      Chief Executive Elon Musk,  who said last week he agreed to build a giant battery system in the state of South Australia, where Adelaide is the capital city, to store power from a wind farm. Such a system could provide electricity during shortages. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull,  in an emailed response to Wall Street Journal questions, blamed previous Labor governments. Mr. Turnbull, of the center-right Liberal Party, said \u201cgas export licenses were issued without regard to the consequences for the domestic market,\u201d and, \u201cas a result, at a time of record gas production we have had the prospect of a shortage of domestic gas on the east coast.\u201d An LNG export facility in the distance near Gladstone.Photo: Rachel Pannett/The Wall Street Journal The Labor Party says that when the LNG-export plants were approved, the industry said sales abroad wouldn\u2019t impact domestic gas supply because it was developing new sources of gas. \u201cIt is clear that those assurances haven\u2019t come to pass,\u201d said Mark Butler, the Labor lawmaker who is currently its spokesman on energy. \u201cIf we had our time again, we would have put in place a national-interest test,\u201d he said. Such a test insures domestic needs are protected."]
["World News", "Australia\u2019s plight is less likely in America, which is experiencing a gas glut and is boosting exports. The first LNG-export terminal in the lower 48 states opened in Louisiana last year, allowing exports by ship in addition to existing pipelines to Mexico and Canada. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said at his Senate confirmation hearing he wanted to boost natural-gas exports.  The U.S. is on track to become the world\u2019s No. 3 LNG exporter behind Qatar and Australia by 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Unlike Australia\u2014which has plentiful gas supplies in its west but no pipelines to get them to its gas-starved east\u2014the U.S. has a large pipeline grid, making it easier to move supplies during shortages. It also has largely avoided the kind of long-term export contracts that trapped Australian companies into giving foreign buyers priority. Still, Australia\u2019s gas pains offer a case study in what can go wrong in committing to expanding exports at the same time as other steady power sources are shutting down, said Michael Webber,  deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cWe have more options\u201d in America than Australia, he said, but \u201cthere\u2019s always a risk that markets will behave in a different way than we anticipated.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no one country that has mastered this,\u201d Mr. Webber said. \u201cWe\u2019re all learning from each other.\u201d Until the 2000s, Australia was a minnow in international energy markets. It had major gas deposits off its northwestern coast, but coal remained its dominant fuel source."]
["World News", "Geologists had suspected there was methane gas buried in Australia\u2019s vast coal seams. When energy prices climbed with Chinese demand, companies including BG Group PLC, now owned by\n        Royal Dutch Shell\n          \n      PLC, rushed to extract this \u201ccoal-seam gas\u201d\u2014a process that involves pushing gas out of seams, sometimes through hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking\u201d\u2014in Australia\u2019s east. \nConocoPhillips\n            \n      bought a 50% stake in an Australian coal-seam-gas venture for $8 billion in 2008.

Producers say they concluded the only way to justify the cost of extracting coal-seam gas was to sell it abroad, where demand was higher and customers would agree to long-term contracts. They also needed money to build terminals on the east coast to convert gas into liquid for shipping.  In 2009, BG Group and Adelaide-based\n        Santos\n Ltd.\n      signed 20-year export deals, the first of a string of long-term export contracts that coal-seam-gas concerns in Australia would sign."]

Its government now says it couldn\u2019t have predicted all the forces creating current shortages. Western Australia state did implement a similar plan years before for its offshore gas, avoiding local gas shortages. The plan also applied to exports from LNG terminals added on the west coast after 2009. In Australia\u2019s east, three terminals were built off Gladstone in Queensland. As gas production increased, Australia cut back on coal, whose use had put it among the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse-gas emitters per capita. Coal-fueled plants were shut down without comprehensive plans for replacing them with other power sources. South Australia and Queensland, in 2014 and 2015, set targets to get 50% of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. Gas, the argument went, would help fill the gap when renewable power wasn\u2019t sufficient."]
["World News", "Some prospective new gas sources in the east were being shut down, with New South Wales placing a moratorium on fracking in 2011\u00a0and later freezing new exploration licenses for coal-seam gas. Victoria in March this year banned fracking and new coal-seam-gas development. Santos and its partners weren\u2019t able to pump as much gas as expected and began signing third-party supply contracts, including from other gas producers and electricity companies to meet export obligations, adding to factors driving up domestic prices. As prices rose, some manufacturers using gas, such as fertilizer makers, publicly threatened to move operations abroad. Power plants relying on gas\u2014currently about 25% of Australia\u2019s power grid\u2014raised rates. \u201cSantos has been singled out as almost the sole cause\u201d of Australia\u2019s gas problems, Santos Chairman Peter Coates told shareholders in May. Coal-seam gas could underpin Australia\u2019s long-term needs with more investment and never would have been developed without foreign buyers, he said. \u201cThe gas would still be sitting in the ground.\u201d Gladstone, the city with the three new LNG-export facilities, has been among areas most affected. It is home to manufacturers that use gas, including Australia\u2019s largest aluminum smelter, a\n        Rio Tinto\n          \n      PLC plant that once distributed beer-can holders reading: \u201cProudly Australian, operating beyond 2030.\u201d In March, Rio Tinto cut 14% of the smelter\u2019s production and laid off 100 workers, saying it couldn\u2019t secure enough inexpensive energy.

Outages have become a familiar gas-crisis byproduct, including one last September in which 1.7 million\u00a0households and businesses in South Australia state lost power\u00a0after tornadoes damaged lines supplying power from Victoria. South Australia was relying on other states for electricity because volatile gas prices and other issues had forced its generators to cut capacity.\u00a0Power wasn\u2019t fully restored for 12 days. In the week that Adelaide\u2019s February blackout cut power to 90,000 homes, five ships left Gladstone carrying out 314,000 tons of LNG altogether, according to the port operator. That\u2019s enough to generate electricity for roughly 750,000 Australian homes for a year, according to calculations for the Journal by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Adelaide blackout traced to 2015, when the Pelican Point gas-fired power plant\u2019s owner,\n            Engie\u00a0SA\n            \n      of France, mothballed one of its two turbines, saying it was too expensive to run at prevailing gas prices."]
["World News", "When Australia\u2019s electricity overseer, the\u00a0Australian Energy Market Operator,\u00a0ordered Pelican Point to fire up its second turbine that hot February day, Engie initially said it wasn\u2019t available. When the regulator insisted, Engie said it couldn\u2019t move quickly without gas-supply contracts. Engie declined to comment about the blackout. In a media statement afterward, it said: \u201cThere is no commercial rationale to operate the second Pelican Point unit in the current market environment in [South Australia] for a small number of days across the year.\u201d Engie in March agreed to restart the second turbine after\n            Origin Energy\n Ltd.\n      , which operates one of the Queensland LNG plants, committed to provide gas to Pelican Point and buy some of its electricity. Prime Minister Turnbull that month urged producers to reserve more gas for the domestic market. He declared in April he would invoke little-used trade powers to block some exports until local needs were met; the measures went into effect July 1. The energy regulator in June said the market and government response should help secure the power grid, though it \u201cremains susceptible\u201d to extreme summer conditions. South Australia and Queensland are promising to open\u00a0more land to gas development. Shell has reduced exports from one Australian LNG facility to supply more gas locally and recently signed supply contracts with utilities, including a short-term deal with Engie."]

["Oil Markets", "\nCommerzbank\n            \n      said Libya\u2019s problems were among the most important reasons crude-oil prices began recovering in late March after falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since November. \u201cAt least one potential source of additional supply has fallen away for the time being,\u201d the bank said in a note this week. \u201cThis is without a doubt bad news for Libya.\u201d Libya\u2019s nascent oil-industry recovery\u2014once expected to help keep a lid on oil prices by adding to a global glut\u2014has hit a wall. In March, Libyan output fell to 610,000 barrels a day from 670,000 in February, its first month-to-month fall since August, the International Energy Agency said Thursday. Predictions that Libyan output could return to over 1 million barrels a day have turned out to be \u201cwishful thinking,\u201d said Commerzbank. Security officers stand next to the administration building at the industrial zone at the oil port of Brega, Libya, on Jan. 12.Photo: esam omran al-fetori/Reuters The mix of challenges doesn\u2019t bode well for Libya\u2019s oil industry, said Geoff Porter,  president of North Africa Risk Consulting Inc., which advises oil companies in Libya. These factors \u201cwill accelerate Libya\u2019s descent into instability,\u201d Mr. Porter said. To be a sure, a host of variables are lifting oil prices, which were at $55.64 a barrel for Brent crude on Friday, down 0.4% on the day. Prices are up over 11% since Nov. 30, when the 13-nation oil cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, decided to cut production collectively to help reduce a global oversupply of crude. Libya, an OPEC member, was except from the agreement."]
["Oil Markets", "In recent days, other news has pushed oil prices higher, including a Wall Street Journal report that Saudi Arabia wants to renew the OPEC production-cut agreement when the group meets again in May. Libya looked ready for a rebound last year. After years of fighting around its oil ports\u2014key pawns in the battles that have divided the country since the death of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi\u2014a militia leader, Gen. Khalifa Haftar, in September captured what is known as the country\u2019s \u201coil crescent\u201d and reopened it to Western oil traders for the first time in two years. Three months later, Libya\u2019s state-run National Oil Co. brokered a deal with militias in the country\u2019s desert south to restart a pipeline from the country\u2019s largest oil field. Libya\u2019s oil production soon began climbing from lows of less than 300,000 barrels a day to over 600,000 barrels a day by the end of 2016. There was hope that oil money could be a salve for the country\u2019s political problems.  But, with few functioning institutions beyond the National Oil Co. and Libya\u2019s central bank, the petroleum-industry revival proved hard to sustain. A United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, the Government of National Accord, hasn\u2019t been able to exert power over large swaths of the country\u2019s east and south. Much of the country remains under the control of a hodgepodge of militias vying for influence. And banks remain wary of financing Libyan companies and deals because of existing U.N. sanctions on individuals and firms suspected of trafficking weapons into the country."]
["Oil Markets", "The result has been a cash shortage in recent weeks that stopped the Libyan central bank from being able to pay a militia in the south. In response, the militia shut down a pipeline from the Sharara oil field. Separately, control of Libya\u2019s oil ports remains in flux. Gen. Haftar, whose seizure of oil ports last year helped reopen Libya for exports, had to fight off a group called Benghazi Defense Brigades last month.

["Europe News", "The police said a lack of forensic links to the crime scene helped clear their initial suspect, a Pakistani who arrived in Germany a year ago.  The violence in the center of the capital also raised new questions about Germany\u2019s light security posture amid an upsurge of terror in Europe that has largely spared the country until this week. Despite warnings about the possibility of an attack on one of Germany\u2019s signature Christmas fairs, there were no barriers and no more than five police at the Berlin site when the truck slammed into market stalls and visitors. \u201cWe had some officers there to keep an eye on the market,\u201d a police spokesman said. \u201cWe now see it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

Authorities called for Christmas markets in Berlin to close but urged that those outside the capital stay open. Islamic State said via its official Amaq news agency that one of its fighters had followed calls to attack members of \u201ccoalition countries.\u201d Germany is a member of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the terror group in Syria and Iraq, though not in a combat role. It was at least the fourth time this year that Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack in Germany, though this was the only of those resulting in multiple deaths."]
["Europe News", "A witness followed the truck\u2019s driver as he fled the scene on Monday night and reported to the police that the man had disappeared on the edge of the sprawling Tiergarten park, police said. Soon after, near the center of the park, police took into custody a Pakistani man who resembled the witness\u2019s description.  \u201cBecause the witness had been observing the man from a distance, we couldn\u2019t be 100% sure that the man was the driver,\u201d said Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf.  As the man continued to deny involvement Tuesday and forensic tests failed to link him to the scene, officials\u2019 doubts grew that they had the right man. The police urged Berliners to stay vigilant. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet been able to confirm that this person was in fact the driver,\u201d Klaus Kandt, the Berlin police chief, initially said at a news conference, referring to the man who had been detained. Later he told reporters: \u201cIt is possible that we have a dangerous criminal here in the area.\u201d In a passenger seat of the black Scania truck that barreled through the Christmas market at Berlin\u2019s iconic Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, police found a Polish man who had been shot dead. That man, officials said Tuesday, was the original driver of the truck belonging to a Polish trucking company, which had picked up construction steel from a Thyssenkrupp AG site a 3-mile drive north of the crime scene."]

He added that the last anyone heard from Mr. Urban was when his wife spoke to him by phone at 3 p.m. on Monday. The GPS data showed the truck started moving back and forth at 3:45, \u201clike someone was trying to learn to drive it,\u201d Mr. Zurawski said. Then for several hours there was no movement until 7:40 p.m., shortly before the attack.

The attacker avoided those obstacles by driving the truck through the open pedestrian entrance of the market.  The driver \u201cmust have done his research ahead of time,\u201d said Michael Roden, chairman of the vendors\u2019 association of the Christmas market. \u201cWe never thought a fully loaded 18-ton truck would be able to drive into the market.\u201d"]

The case of Mr. Amri, who prosecutors said was likely behind the wheel of a trailer truck that plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin leaving 12 people dead, is stirring a debate in Germany over the ability to deal with the flood of migrants allowed into the country. The case also highlights a problem for many European countries that now are trying to deport migrants whose asylum claims have been turned down."]
["Europe News", "Italy, where authorities said Mr. Amri arrived in 2011, also tried to deport him to Tunisia in 2015, but faced similar problems, according to an Italian official. Legal provisions in Italy limit detention of migrants set for deportation to 72 hours. At the European Union level, more efforts are being made to speed up returns, with a new border security agency set to organize flights and escort migrants from several EU countries starting early next year. In parallel, negotiations are ongoing with Tunisia and others on deals that would offer money and assistance in return for a greater willingness to take back migrants. The U.S. is also seeking to make uncooperative countries take back migrants, particularly those convicted of crimes in the U.S. A 2001 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court limited detention to six months for migrants set to be deported, forcing authorities to release thousands of convicted criminals whose countries refuse to take them back. The recent shooting death in Milan of Berlin terror suspect Anis Amir has raised many questions about European security gaps.

Using fake identities, he moved around Germany and filed an asylum request, which was rejected this summer."]
["Europe News", "The Tunisian government declined to comment on why it refused to take Mr. Amri back. According to German officials, Tunisia eventually issued the papers necessary for Mr. Amri\u2019s repatriation, but only on Wednesday, two days after the attack and hours after a manhunt for Mr. Amri was launched.  Mr. Amri was able to receive asylum-seeker benefits for nearly a year and stay in the country while awaiting repatriation even after his application was declined. As of Nov. 30, of the 32,714 Tunisian asylum seekers in the country, decisions were taken for nearly 1,500 to be repatriated, but only 111 had been sent back to Tunisia, according to the German interior ministry.

BlackRock\u2019s flows during the quarter highlight an ongoing shift in investor taste for lower-cost passive funds that track the performance of indexes. Roughly 93% of BlackRock\u2019s $55 billion in long-term net inflows during the third quarter came from its iShares exchange-traded-fund unit."]
["Markets Main", "Those changing industry flows have been a source of pain for firms that have long specialized in hand-picking stocks and bonds. \u201cWe believe the utilization of ETFs is going to continue to grow,\u201d Chief Executive Laurence Fink said in an interview, adding that he expects greater use of the products by active managers and of bond ETFs broadly. The iShares business, which comprises about a quarter of BlackRock\u2019s assets under management, pulled in net new money across all asset classes. Meanwhile, investors pulled a net $7.8 billion from BlackRock\u2019s actively managed equity strategies. The firm\u2019s active bond strategies attracted a net $10.2 billion during the quarter. Still, the growing popularity of passive over active products was one of several factors that contributed to BlackRock\u2019s slight year-on-year revenue decline, Mr. Fink said. Revenue fell 2.5% to $2.84 billion in the third quarter. Other factors included continued client uncertainty, a large performance fee during the same quarter a year earlier, and currency movements associated with the U.K.\u2019s June decision to leave the European Union, he said. BlackRock\u2019s own active funds haven\u2019t been immune from the performance challenges traditional money managers have faced.  Half of the firm\u2019s traditional actively managed stock funds underperformed their benchmark or peers over one year at the end of September, up from 20% a year earlier. Over three years 34% were underperforming, down from 42% at the same time last year."]

Meanwhile, over three years, 17% were underperforming, up from 3% at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Some of those funds, Mr. Fink said, were hurt by incorrect bets on the outcome of the Brexit vote and on the health of the Japanese economy. Active managers broadly continue to be challenged by central banks, he added.  \u201cEverything is more correlated than ever before. I think that\u2019s the biggest issue facing the active industry,\u201d Mr. Fink said, adding that the firm hadn\u2019t given up on active management. \u201cOnce we see a change in behavior by central banks, you probably have a higher opportunity to make active returns.\u201d BlackRock has benefited in recent years, analysts say, from its broader mix of businesses than many of its rivals. In addition to active and passive funds, for example, BlackRock also sells investment and risk-management technology. \u201cWe continue to believe that size, a diverse product lineup and a strong ETF business are the ingredients to success for asset managers in this challenging environment,\u201d Edward Jones analysts said in a note Tuesday. \u201cIn our view, BlackRock is one of the few asset managers that fit this profile.\u201d Total net inflows at BlackRock, including cash management, totaled $69.8 billion in the third quarter."]

By 1999, when the money manager went public, it had gathered $165 billion in assets. A series of canny deals in the mid- to late-2000s added to its heft and its mix of businesses. The firm bought Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in 2006, a transaction that helped it expand globally and bolster its stock-picking and multiasset businesses. The deal boosted BlackRock\u2019s assets under management to about $1 trillion for the first time. Then, in 2009, with $1.3 trillion in assets, it acquired Barclays Global Investors, gaining a large exchange-traded-fund business that helped it turn iShares into the world\u2019s largest ETF business.

["Middle East News", "Another $61 million would go toward nuclear development, Hossein Naghavi-Hosseini, the spokesman of parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy committee, told state television. The move was a response to recent American sanctions, including U.S. legislation targeting Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful military body whose Quds Force wing oversees Iran\u2019s involvement in conflicts in Iraq and Syria. They were part of a package of sanctions also targeting Russia and North Korea. Mr. Trump signed the legislation early this month. Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a body composed of legal and clerical experts who vets legislation for its constitutionality and compliance with Islamic law, must approve the bill before it becomes law. Iran sees the U.S. sanctions as violations of the landmark nuclear deal it reached in 2015 with six world powers including the U.S. The deal sought to ensure Iran couldn\u2019t produce nuclear warheads by curbing its nuclear enrichment program. In exchange, Tehran got relief from sanctions. \u201cIf the Americans impose sanctions on Iran in violation of the [nuclear deal], the Iranian government\u2026is obliged to take reciprocal action in nuclear and other affairs,\u201d parliament speaker Ali Larijani said, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran has continued to test ballistic missiles even after the deal took effect at the beginning of last year, prompting concern in the West. The country has a large arsenal of such missiles, the most advanced of which can reach Israel, Iran\u2019s sworn enemy and the U.S.\u2019s closest regional ally."]
["Middle East News", "The nuclear deal made no mention of ballistic missiles, although a United Nations Security Council resolution tied to its implementation called upon Iran to refrain from developing missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.  Iran has asserted that its missile development doesn\u2019t violate the spirit or letter of the nuclear deal because the missiles aren\u2019t nuclear-capable and are for self-defense. Mr. Naghavi-Hosseini said Sunday that the new bill also wouldn\u2019t contravene the deal. But Mr. Trump said in April that Iran was violating the spirit of the deal, which he called a mistake during his presidential campaign and promised to undo should he be elected. In February, shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump tweeted that Iran was formally \u201con notice\u201d over its ballistic missile tests. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration imposed sanctions on Iranian entities connected to ballistic missiles in February, May and July. Tensions between the two countries frayed further this year after a series of confrontations at sea in the Persian Gulf. U.S. warships regularly patrol the key oil-shipping waterway, which Iran considers to be part of its sphere of influence. There have been 13 unsafe or unprofessional interactions between Iranian and U.S. maritime forces so far this year, according to a U.S. statement last week. In addition to funding Iran\u2019s military and nuclear program, Sunday\u2019s parliament bill directed Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, the IRGC and other ministries to draft a strategy to confront U.S. threats within six months."]

["Middle East News", "Islamic State has also told fighters to go to Libya from Syria, where a U.S.-led coalition is pushing the terror group from its de facto capital of Raqqa, according to a defector and European security officials. \u201cThey consider Libya to be the main entrance to Europe,\u201d said Abu Baara al-Ansari, a Syrian who says he defected from Islamic State in June. Mr. al-Ansari said he worked in Raqqa for Islamic State in the office that tracked visitors to the group\u2019s territory. He is now in Turkey and was interviewed via the Telegram messaging system. The group\u2019s efforts to stage a comeback in Libya after losing control of the coastal city of Sirte last year have sparked concern among European officials.

["Middle East News", "But other officials said it is difficult to know how many Islamic State fighters are currently in Libya.

Since driving Islamic State out of Sirte, the U.S. has seen \u201ca marked decrease\u201d in the number of foreign fighters traveling to or from the conflict in Libya, according to a U.S. State Department official. European security officials and the Islamic State defector say the group\u2019s fighters\u2014including Syrians and Iraqis, as well as Libyans\u2014have been trying to enter Libya in hopes of reaching Europe to launch attacks. Islamic State members have in the past flown from Turkey to Sudan before going overland to Libya, according to European security officials. Meanwhile, Libyan forces in the south are monitoring a group of Islamic State recruits who made their way to Sudan from Syria and are trying to cross into Libya, according to a security official from the area with forces loyal to Tripoli.  Sudan is aware some fighters have taken advantage of its porous western border to infiltrate Libya, according to Rabie Abdelaty, who heads the political bureau at Sudan\u2019s ruling National Congress Party.

["Middle East News", "Libyans were among those who trained at Islamic State\u2019s weapons lab in Raqqa, according to another Islamic State defector. Some of the devices were intended both for battlefield use and for carrying out attacks in Europe, said the defector, who said that he was involved in their design and that he left the group in 2016. Components are cheap and easy to get, and Islamic State videos show how to assemble them, he added.

In late May, around the time of the ouster, two members of the allied group were dispatched by Islamic State from Benghazi to go to Istanbul, according to a third person who said he had defected from Islamic State and who said he remains in contact with the group in Raqqa. They were directed to make their way from Istanbul to Athens and to wait for orders about carrying out an attack in Europe, the defector said. A European security official said last month the movements of the two men were being monitored.  Islamic State fighters who escaped Sirte fled to other parts of Libya such as Bani Walid, west of Sirte. The fighters remained hidden in the surrounding valleys for months, but now have started to \u201cset up checkpoints at times and hijack trucks and any goods in them,\u201d said the intelligence officer from Misrata."]
["Middle East News", "Other fighters escaped to the southwestern town of Ghat, near the Algerian border. The group has since expanded its presence in that part of the country to the desert oasis of Ubari, with fighters holding regular meetings in the town and moving freely in the vicinity of Libya\u2019s largest oil field, according to the security official from southern Libya. In May, Islamic State seized three fuel trucks en route to Jufra, a district between Sirte and Ubari, according to an Aug. 22 report from the U.N. Security Council. Islamic State has forged business ties in the area with a local Islamist warlord who specializes in fuel smuggling, according to a European security official. Islamic State also has a presence in other Libyan cities and towns, and groups that can range from five to 50 fighters roam outside urban areas, the intelligence officer from Misrata said. Those groups often travel in a small number of cars to try to avoid becoming a target, he said. In January, the U.S. launched airstrikes on Islamic State training camps southwest of Sirte and other targets in Libya, killing dozens of militants, the Pentagon said. \u2014Ben Kesling, Nicholas Bariyo, Nour Malas, Nour Alakraa and Jenny Gross contributed to this article.

But even as Russian pressures the Syrian regime to attend talks, it doesn\u2019t have any illusions that Mr. Assad would be ultimately willing to share power with the opposition, he said. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said Russia supports the Geneva talks and is working with both sides on \u201ca constructive dialogue.\u201d As part of a de-escalation agreement brokered this year by Russia, Turkey and Iran, hostilities between the rebels and regime were meant to cease and humanitarian-aid deliveries permitted into besieged areas.

["Heard on the Street", "Growth remains robust, and financial conditions have stayed loose despite the stronger euro. There even has been promising news from politicians, with French President Emmanuel Macron unveiling an ambitious overhaul of labor regulations\u2014precisely the sort of move the ECB has been calling for. Still, the account of the ECB\u2019s July meeting showed that nerves about the sensitivity of financial markets to the slightest shift in communication. Even silence can move markets these days, however. ECB President Mario Draghi steered clear of talking about monetary policy at all in his much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole in August, but the euro still rose in its wake, topping $1.20 for the first time in more than two years. Patience on policy also bears risks. While the euro\u2019s rise has drawn a lot of attention, other markets have been much calmer over the summer. The 10-year German government-bond yield, at just 0.38%, is well off its highs for the year\u2014which looks odd in the face of stronger growth. There could yet be a tantrum to come for bond markets, and an ECB that appears too cautious now could store up trouble for the future. The ECB might yet play for more time in September, but that will just put the focus on October: The lull in bond markets can\u2019t last forever.

["Middle East Crossroads", "Now that reinvigorated Iraqi security forces have rolled back most of Islamic State\u2019s gains, this perspective isn\u2019t as clear-cut\u2014even taking into account the war\u2019s huge human toll. After all, in the absence of American backup, Islamic State\u2019s existential threat forced a strong immune response from the Iraqi body politic. The Popular Mobilization Forces that sprang up from Shiite militias in 2014, after a call to defend the homeland by top Iraqi Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, stopped the extremist group\u2019s blitzkrieg. Then, quarreling Iraqi political factions came together. The Kurdish regional government in the north ushered in unprecedented security cooperation with Baghdad and the rebuilt Iraqi army. Defeating Islamic State became an Iraqi rather than an American war.

Mr. Assadi heads a parliamentary bloc of supporters of Moqtada al-Sadr, a populist Shiite cleric whose militias used to fight U.S. troops before 2011. True, the U.S. and other Western allies had to send troops back to Iraq, mostly in an advisory capacity, in 2014. They are, however, viewed very differently these days. Even the once-hostile Shiite militias consider them, however reluctantly, de facto allies."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "So, as the White House debates its options in Afghanistan\u2014ranging from a significant troop increase to a full withdrawal\u2014to what extent are Iraq\u2019s experiences applicable to the Afghan conflict? Could the Afghan state, left to its own devices at least for a time, also transform the battle against the Taliban into a national and popular struggle? The answer is, most likely, no. America\u2019s Afghan war, now 16 years long, is different from the Iraqi conflict in many crucial respects. And that is not just because Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, unlike Iraq\u2019s leader six years ago, wants an American military presence to continue for as long as possible. While the Iraqi insurgency raged within the country\u2019s Sunni minority, Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban are drawn mostly from the country\u2019s dominant ethnic group, the Pashtuns. And the Taliban keep advancing despite the presence of nearly 9,000 U.S. troops. While U.S. casualties in Afghanistan are relatively rare nowadays, they still occur: On Wednesday, the Pentagon said two U.S. troops died in Kandahar. Unlike oil-rich Iraq, Afghanistan can\u2019t pay for its own military and requires several billion dollars in Western assistance every year. Add to this a political class that is even more corrupt and riven by infighting than the Iraqis in 2014, and it becomes clear that removing the American backstop would likely precipitate a rapid and inevitable collapse of the Afghan state, former and current Western officials say."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cWithdrawing and daring the Afghans to \u2018step up\u2019 when they cannot without U.S. support is a recipe for disaster,\u201d said James Cunningham,  a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. In Iraq, he added, \u201c\u2018victory\u2019 depended on circumstances that are particularly Iraqi and the destruction of a major city.\u00a0The circumstances in Afghanistan are different and collapse of the government and reversion to chaos will not be easily reversed, if at all.\u201d That is one of the reasons why America\u2019s North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, even though many of them pressed for an end date to the Afghan military mission five years ago, have since accepted the open-ended deployment. That is especially so given the emergence of Islamic State\u2019s regional affiliate in parts of Afghanistan. Compared with Afghanistan today, \u201cIraq was far more stable at the time of the U.S. withdrawal, and it still collapsed,\u201d said Vali Nasr,  dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan. \u201cAfghan national security forces don\u2019t look like they have the capacity to take on the Taliban and ISIS. They are losing ground even with U.S. troops there and will lose even more ground without U.S. troops.\u201d While a military victory against the Taliban isn\u2019t in the cards anytime soon, the relatively small U.S. presence in Afghanistan prevents the fall of Kabul and other main cities.

The GOP election sweep of Congress and the White House has given the idea of adopting a border adjustment added momentum as part of the party\u2019s plans to enact the most far-reaching overhaul of the U.S. tax code since 1986. "]
["Politics and Policy", "House Republicans are still at an early stage of revamping the entire tax code. And lawmakers are still working out details of the proposed border adjustment that, if enacted, would mark a sea change for U.S. corporate taxation. The idea already is being scrutinized by economists and businesses.   For the U.S., the idea of a border adjustment is novel and moving quickly from theory into reality. Republicans pitch it and a drop to 20% in the corporate tax rate as their alternative to the straight import tariffs President-elect Donald Trump has proposed.  Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), the border-adjustment plan\u2019s chief proponent, says the current tax code contains backward incentives that encourage imports and discourage exports.\u00a0\u201cBy leveling the playing field between imports and exports, we expect much stronger demand here in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d  President-elect Donald Trump has threatened tariffs between 35% and 45% on imports to the U.S. Here's how those proposals could alter trade dynamics in the U.S. and abroad. Yet deciphering the practical impact of such a change in the tax regime is more complex and\u00a0must take into consideration factors such as foreign exchange rates, other countries\u2019 reactions to any U.S. move and, of course, the plan\u2019s ultimate design, which is still on the drawing board.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple subject,\u201d said Alan Viard,  an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Meanwhile, companies are scrambling to understand the few emerging details of the border-adjustment plan. And some fierce opposition to it is emerging. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Koch Industries Inc., the conglomerate led by the billionaire Koch brothers who fund conservative think tanks and interest groups and are influential in Republican politics, sharply criticized the idea of a border adjustment\u00a0on Wednesday. It warned of what it called \u2018devastating\u201d effects.  Import-reliant retailers and manufacturers are fired up, too.  Applied mechanically, without assuming the impact of currency changes, U.S. border adjustments under consideration would raise taxes on the motor vehicle and retail industries and cut them on chemicals and electronics, according to an analysis by Ernst & Young LLP. Broadly, however, economists suggest adoption of a border adjustment might not necessarily have the desired effect and could be a wash at the end of the day because currencies and trade flows eventually adapt to changes in taxation. If U.S. exporters, freed of tax, are able to charge less for their goods abroad, demand for them\u2014and the U.S. dollar\u2014could rise, leading to higher overseas prices and ultimately moderating overseas sales for those same products.  \u201cThe effects on trade of these two components\u2014the import\u00a0tax\u00a0and the export subsidy\u2014are offsetting,\u201d write economists Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Alan Auerbach in a recent paper. \u201cAdopting them together imposes no trade distortions even though adopting either separately would.\u201d But there is more to Mr. Brady\u2019s plan than border adjustment, and the entire GOP tax overhaul might change long-run investment decisions. The key is a global comparison of taxes."]
["Politics and Policy", "Most major nations levy corporate income taxes and value-added taxes that are a sort of consumption tax applied at each stage of production. VAT, however, is removed from exports, so it applies only to a country\u2019s domestic consumption. The U.S., which has a relatively low general tax burden, doesn\u2019t impose VAT. Rep. Kevin Brady, (R-Texas) is the border-adjustment plan\u2019s chief proponent.Photo: Susan Walsh/Associated Press Mr. Brady\u2019s plan, though he doesn\u2019t describe it this way, could be thought of as in effect repealing the 35% corporate income\u00a0tax in the U.S. and replacing it with a 20% tax that appears in many ways like a value-added tax that would apply only in relation to sales of domestically produced products and services sold in the U.S. and to imported goods. As with VAT regimes abroad, Mr. Brady\u2019s proposed border levy is applied where a product is consumed, not where a company\u2019s corporate headquarters or intellectual property is located, as would be the case with a corporate income tax.  In Mr. Brady\u2019s plan and in a VAT, a company\u2019s capital expenses could be deducted immediately, though net interest wouldn\u2019t be deductible.\u00a0The only major difference between Mr. Brady\u2019s plan and other countries\u2019 VAT is that those taxes generally don\u2019t allow tax deductions for wages, while his proposal would. Viewed that way, the potential advantage for U.S.-made products, whether intended for sale at home or abroad, is clear. The competitive advantage for American companies wouldn\u2019t stem from\u00a0the border\u00a0adjustment per se. It would come from the fact that other countries would still levy corporate taxes on top of VAT. "]
["Politics and Policy", "With U.S. corporate\u00a0taxes\u00a0abolished in favor of the redesigned corporate tax, any company paying corporate income taxes somewhere would be disadvantaged against a U.S. competitor. \n\u2018The effects on trade of these two components\u2014the import\u00a0tax\u00a0and the export subsidy\u2014are offsetting.\u2019\n In the simplest terms, here\u2019s how the Brady plan would appear to work:  Today, a U.S. manufacturer exporting, say, machinery to France would pay U.S. corporate income tax and France\u2019s VAT. Competing French machinery would bear the cost of the French income\u00a0tax\u00a0and VAT. Under Mr. Brady\u2019s plan, all U.S. taxes come off at the\u00a0border. So U.S.-produced machinery sold in France would bear only French VAT, while French-made counterparts would be subjected to French income\u00a0tax and VAT. The same occurs in the opposite direction. A British drugmaker exporting to the U.S. would pay U.K. corporate\u00a0tax\u00a0and VAT. But that VAT would come off at the\u00a0British border. A competing U.S.-made product sold domestically at present would be subjected to U.S. corporate income\u00a0tax, which generally is higher than that of many other countries.  But under Mr. Brady\u2019s plan, the imported U.K. drug, already bearing U.K. income\u00a0tax, would get slapped with the new tax at the U.S. border.  If that British company were to move production to the U.S., it would avoid U.K. corporate\u00a0tax and pay just the new 20% American tax.  \u201cIf the fundamental economic story about trade balance is correct, the only reason for a foreign firm to relocate production to the United States wouldn't be to get a U.S.\u00a0tax subsidy or to avoid a U.S.\u00a0tax\u00a0penalty, but rather to avoid the foreign country income\u00a0tax\u00a0on the export sale,\u201d Ed Kleinbard,  former chief of staff of Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, said."]
["Politics and Policy", "The big unknown about the tax regime Mr. Brady envisions is how other countries would react to what would be a change in U.S. policy that would create significant consequences for the country\u2019s trading partners. Other nations could retaliate with punitive taxes and tariffs or file a challenge in the World Trade Organization, leaving the U.S. border-adjustment plan in limbo for years.  Still, Mr. Brady is confident the plan will pass muster. \u201cI\u2019m sure China and Europe and others will holler because their current\u00a0tax\u00a0advantage goes away and this will be a level playing field,\u201d he said. \u2014Greg Ip contributed to this article.

Its exit is scheduled for March 2019. The U.K. said Tuesday it wanted closer defense cooperation than any other country with the EU and would use its military and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism and cybercrime.  Britain has the largest defense budget in Europe and the second largest in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the U.S. Britain and France are the only two EU countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Earlier this year, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May was criticized by EU politicians after she said a failure to reach a Brexit agreement would damage cooperation between the U.K. and the EU in countering crime and terrorism.  At the time, Guy Verhofstadt,  the EU Parliament\u2019s chief negotiator on Brexit, said the European Parliament wouldn\u2019t accept any attempt by the U.K. to use its military prowess as a bargaining chip. One way forward could be to establish a formal body for the U.K. and the EU to discuss foreign policy goals, sanctions and security issues to ensure close cooperation. However, the U.K. government didn\u2019t spell out on Tuesday how this could work and said these discussions would take place as part of Brexit negotiations."]

Bush administration, has said she is concerned about the chill the law was having on campus climate, and on student and faculty recruitment. House Speaker Pro Tem Paul Stam said he doesn\u2019t support changes to the law for now. \u201cObviously we\u2019re not going to say \u2018Yes sir, yes sir, Mr. President,\u2019 \u201d he said.  Mr. Stam said it is wrong for the Justice Department to use the letters to send a message about bathroom use by transgender people that could apply to all major employers. \u201cThe Obama administration has declared war on everybody in the whole nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are saying gender identity is purely subjective, and has no objective criteria.\u201d  The Justice Department\u2019s action indicates an expansion of the federal government\u2019s effort to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from what it says are discriminatory state and local laws, said Brad Sears, executive director of the Williams Institute, a research facility at the UCLA School of Law. \u201cThis really starts to provide protections to LGBT people throughout the entire country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Justice Department is saying federal law that prohibits sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sears said any legal fight between North Carolina and Washington could put at risk some of the federal funding the state receives. North Carolina receives billions of dollars in federal funding, including $4.2 billion in education funding in 2015, with roughly $1 billion going toward elementary and secondary schools and the balance for higher-education student loans and grants, according to the Education Department."]
["Politics and Policy", " Advocates say those funds could be in jeopardy, though it is not clear at this point whether the federal government would penalize the state in that manner.  Passage of the law sparked a major backlash from gay-rights advocates. Some corporations scrapped expansion plans in the state, and some entertainers have canceled shows in protest.  In response to that criticism, the governor has said he would seek to roll back some provisions of the law, but added he was standing by a \u201ccommon sense\u2019\u2019 provision requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate.  \u201cThey\u2019re already hemorrhaging money as a result of their actions, and this put a significant amount of federal funding on the line,\u201d added Sarah Warbelow, legal director with national LGBT-rights group Human Rights Campaign, referencing business that have opted to scale back operations and the potential that the federal government might penalize the state by withholding federal funds. Chris Sgro, executive director at LGBT-rights group Equality NC, as well as a newly appointed Democratic member of North Carolina\u2019s general assembly, said the letters create \u201ca crisis for our state.\u201d Democrats in the Republican-controlled legislature have a bill in place that aims to repeal the entire state law, he noted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s much that\u2019s worse than being out of compliance with one of the most important laws in the country,\u201d Mr. Sgro said. \u201cThe state cannot afford to wait one more day to act to repeal the legislation.\u201d"]

The Internal Revenue Service declined to comment on the issue. It hasn\u2019t clarified many tax issues pertaining to digital currencies since it issued bare-bones guidance in 2014."]
["Tax Report", " Jim Calvin,  a buy-side tax specialist at Deloitte, thinks the receipt could be taxable this year for technical reasons. If so, recipients would have ordinary income, although the amount isn\u2019t clear. It could be based either on the value of Bitcoin Cash when issued or when investors could trade it, which wasn\u2019t immediately. One source quoted the price of\u00a0Bitcoin Cash\u00a0on Aug. 1 as ranging from $210 to $426. Thus\u00a0Bitcoin Cash\u00a0recipients could\u00a0owe tax this year at rates as high as 39.6%. It\u2019s unclear whether the 3.8% net investment income tax would also apply, says Mr. Calvin. \n Then again, the IRS could say that the receipt of Bitcoin Cash isn\u2019t taxable because it\u2019s a \u201cproperty division.\u201d In this case, no tax would be due until the holder sells or transfers the\u00a0Bitcoin Cash. But the cost basis of both bitcoin holdings would need to be adjusted to account for the split. (Cost basis is the starting point for measuring taxable gain after a holding is sold.) \u201cInvestors need clear guidance from the IRS so they\u2019ll know what they owe and when,\u201d says Mr. Calvin. As tax experts debate how to classify the split,\u00a0the IRS appears focused elsewhere when it comes to digital currencies. The top of its agenda is to root out those who use these currencies for tax evasion. All IRS criminal investigators have received training in virtual currency crimes over the past few years. The agency has\u00a0agreements with\u00a0Chainalysis, a provider of bitcoin investigation software, to detect money laundering, according to an IRS spokesman.\u00a0"]
["Tax Report", "And it is sending a strong message by seeking customer-account information from Coinbase, a San Francisco-based digital-currency-services company.\u00a0Last month, the IRS narrowed the summons after some lawmakers protested that it was too broad. The latest version asks for accounts held between 2013 and 2015 with transactions of $20,000 or more. It also excludes customers who bought bitcoin but didn\u2019t sell it. Experts say the summons will stick. \u201cThe IRS got the information it wanted on Americans hiding money in offshore accounts, and it will get the information it wants on Americans evading taxes through virtual currencies,\u201d says Bryan Skarlatos, a criminal tax attorney with Kostelanetz & Fink in New York. In the absence of IRS guidance, here are experts\u2019 best guesses on other tax issues for digital currencies:  Lot identification. Investors can instruct brokers which shares they intend to sell of stock held in a taxable account. This choice often affects the taxes due on a sale. The\u00a0rules hold true for bitcoin, says Mr. Calvin, except there\u2019s no broker to instruct. He suggests bitcoin investors keep careful records and inform a third party, such as an adviser, how lots are to be chosen for sale ahead of time.  Nondeductible losses. When bitcoin is held for investment, gains are typically taxable and losses can offset gains.  But there\u2019s an exception: If the bitcoin is for personal use\u2014say to buy a meal or a boat\u2014then gains on it are taxable but losses aren\u2019t\u00a0deductible, says tax strategist Bob Gordon of Twenty-First Securities Corp. This longstanding rule also applies to houses, he notes."]
["Tax Report", " Wash-sale rules. These rules penalize taxpayers who sell shares at a loss and buy them\u00a0within 31 days\u00a0before or after the sale. Mr. Gordon says wash-sale rules don\u2019t apply to digital currencies because they aren\u2019t securities. But investors should avoid simultaneous transactions solely to capture losses, he warns. \u201cSales need to have a nontax as well as a tax reason.\u201d  Like-kind exchanges. Section 1031 allows taxpayers to defer taxes on exchanges of similar assets, sometimes for decades. While the rules apply to digital currencies in theory, Silicon Valley tax attorney Roger Royse,  of Royse Law Firm, urges caution. Exchanging one digital currency for another to diversify risk may work, but more complex swaps may not. Taxpayers with like-kind exchanges have to file a special form, he says, \u201cand it\u2019s like waving a red flag at the IRS.\u201d \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Combined, the new plans are expected to create as many as 600 jobs, it said. The new SUV will be sold under the Mercedes-Benz EQ electric vehicle subbrand, but the company didn\u2019t specify its size or engine displacement. German auto makers are moving rapidly toward electrification as demand for their trademark diesel technology has slumped in Europe. The billion-dollar bet by Daimler is part of a wave of U.S. investments planned by foreign auto makers despite weakening sales volumes and widespread expectations for further declines in the market. Earlier this week, Chinese-owned Volvo Cars said it would double its investment in its first U.S. plant in Charleston, S.C., to a total of $1 billion.

Things are looking somewhat brighter recently, however. Chinese metals demand has staged a limited, but real, rebound, and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is touting an infrastructure-investment plan. Share prices of the big five diversified miners are all up over 100% from lows hit in January. Given the improved demand environment, investors could wonder whether mining-company capital expenditures have come down enough to produce another sustained period of rising prices for industrial metals. Unfortunately, the answer is probably not yet, although a global infrastructure push led by Mr. Trump\u2019s America could move the needle if it were large enough."]
["Heard on the Street", "Mining capital expenditures have fallen rapidly since its peak in 2012, but the slowdown in Chinese construction, the main driver of demand, has been more drastic. Even after this year\u2019s real-estate bounce, floor space under construction in 2016 is on track to be about 2.69 billion square feet higher than last year. That is below annual gains running at about 3.23 billion square feet in the middle part of the last decade. Meanwhile, despite falling by over half since 2012, aggregate capital expenditures by the top five global miners\u2014\n            BHP Billiton\n,\n      Rio Tinto, Vale,\n            Anglo American\n            \n      and\n            Glencore\n            \n      \u2014remained more than 50% higher in 2015 than in 2006. This year has seen bigger cuts. Most of the big miners have cut a further 40% from capital-expenditure budgets. The Chinese uptick in real-estate demand has helped close the gap. The issue is the real-estate bounce is likely temporary, driven by buyers rushing to take advantage of cheap mortgages. Fundamental Chinese demand for housing probably peaked at about 18.8 billion square feet earlier in the decade and is now set for a slow decline, according to Gavekal Dragonomics analyst Rosealea Yao."]
["Heard on the Street", "Real-estate investment, which lagged behind housing-price gains for most of 2016, has recently shown signs of perking up. That means metals demand may have room to run in the short term. Iron-ore prices have been on a tear in recent weeks, with prices up nearly 30% since September despite giving up some postelection gains. But absent a new demand driver on the scale of China, which sucks up half of copper and iron ore world-wide, mining investment still looks high. A large enough Trump infrastructure push could make a difference. A Republican-designed stimulus, however, may favor tax cuts rather than direct investment. And $1 trillion over 10 years, which is Mr. Trump\u2019s official plan, is less impressive than it sounds. Chinese infrastructure investment in 2015 alone was nearly $2 trillion, and it is increasing at about $300 billion a year. Investors should watch miners\u2019 2016 results to see whether firms take the bait of higher prices and let capital expenditures drift up again, a dangerous move with margins still squeezed and interest rates rising. Unless Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan proves far more robust than it looks, the iron laws of supply and demand look set to reassert themselves before too long. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

["Fashion", "  Photos: Collaborations Between the Athlete and His Favorite Designers  Westbrook XO represents a new kind of season opener for Mr. Westbrook, who begins his seventh NBA campaign on Oct. 29. At 25, Mr. Westbrook is one of the most thrilling players in the game, an explosive blast of above-the-rim energy and playmaking.  But this is not a basketball story.  This is about Russell Westbrook, style vanguard. You may know that pro basketball is in the middle a style renaissance. Players have been befriending designers and cramming their long legs into the front row at fashion week. There's LeBron James at Michael Bastian. Dwyane Wade at Richard Chai. Tyson Chandler at Alexander Wang. Amar'e Stoudemire at En Noir. The concrete corridors at basketball arenas have become new runways, where fashion-conscious players try to outdo each other before they even step on the hardwood floor.  But even in this style-savvy generation, Mr. Westbrook stands alone. He's the experimenter, the boundary-pusher, the avant-gardist.  Floral jackets. Distressed jeans he's ripped himself. Full lipstick-red monochrome\u2014from shirt to slacks to shoes. Cartoon-print shirts. Denim vests. Madras jackets. Man bags. Spikes. Suspenders. Three-quarter pants. Shorts. Jorts. And glasses upon glasses upon glasses. What Jerry Seinfeld is to Porsches, Russell Westbrook is to eyewear. Sometimes a different pair every day.  \"Russell is Russell, no matter what world he's navigating,\" said Will Welch, style editor of GQ. \"His style of dress reflects his style of play. It's brash and borderline reckless. He's unafraid to make mistakes or fall down. His instinct is to always take the risk and worry about the results later\u2014or just not worry about them at all.\""]
["Fashion", "BOLD MOVES | Left to right: Mr. Westbrook at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards, at New York Fashion Week and arriving for Game Two of the NBA's Western Conference Semifinals. Getty Images (2); Billy Farrell Agency At Freds, the airy restaurant atop Barneys, Mr. Westbrook sipped water and discussed his style evolution. He wore pair of black Zara jeans with a hole in the left knee (\"My big toe did that\"), a short-sleeve hoodie he'd cut the sleeves from and a pair of fluorescent-orange Nike Jordans. New York Fashion Week was winding down, and Mr. Westbrook raved about the Phillip Lim and Public School shows; later, he planned to attend Proenza Schouler.  It was becoming a familiar ritual. In July, not long after the San Antonio Spurs knocked the Thunder out of the NBA playoffs, Mr. Westbrook attended Paris Fashion Week, where he huddled among the likes of Rick Owens and Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing.  \"Now when I go to shows, I get a vibe like I'm basically an editor,\" Mr. Westbrook said. \"I've seen all these places before. I've seen these people before. They know me, I know them.\" Mr. Westbrook grew up in and around Los Angeles, and went to Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, Calif. \"I was a kid who was very knowledgeable of fashion,\" he said. \"It's something that's a part of me. I felt like every day was the first day of school. That's how it was the minute I woke up.\" An early obsession was FUBU's Fat Albert line. \"I had a blue shirt with Fat Albert stuff on it,\" he recalled. \"I did everything in that shirt. And I wanted the jeans to match. The jeans had the big Fat Albert on the back pocket. I didn't get those until later.\" "]
["Fashion", "In college at UCLA, Mr. Westbrook's taste began to widen; he scoured red-carpet photographs from the Oscars and other awards shows for looks. \"Personally I didn't think I was going to make it in the NBA,\" he said. As the fourth pick in the 2008 NBA draft by the Seattle Supersonics (who later moved to Oklahoma City), Mr. Westbrook suddenly had the financial means to buy anything he wanted. But he preferred mixing designer styles with lower-priced purchases.   What's your essential fashion rule?  'Be yourself. It's a kind of confidence and swag you'll have regardless of what anybody else is saying.'  What's one thing you won't wear?  'Women's clothing.'  What's a great inexpensive fashion purchase?   'Nice cotton plain T-shirts. You can do a lot of different things with plain T-shirts.'   What is something everyone should have in their closet?  'Black jeans.' \"I can wear high-end stuff, low-end stuff,\" he said. \"For me it's just keeping it grounded. I grew up around Kmart, Target. There's a way you can make those things look fashionable at the same time as you're making Givenchy and Balmain look fashionable as well.\" He will frequently alter clothes on his own; he joked about nervously scissoring a pair of $400 jeans.  \"I have shirts where I've cut the neck out,\" Mr. Westbrook said. \"If I see something I like, but I want a different look, I've just got to make it myself. It's me being different, not being in the same thing, same brand as everybody else.\""]
["Fashion", "Designers have noticed. \"He creates his own style and goes for a certain look completely, and pulls it off,\" said Tim Coppens, who hosted Mr. Westbrook at one of his shows last fall. \"He wore a silk printed track pant and ivory sweater from [our] spring 2014 collection a couple months ago, a look we showed on the runway. Russell looked amazing in it off the runway.\" The Barneys collaboration was a first\u2014never before had the department store worked on a project like this with an athlete. Mr. Westbrook engaged in frequent conversations about designers and directions and wasn't hesitant to say no\u2014or give a boundary-pushing yes. \"He has a very strong point of view,\" said Tom Kalenderian,  the Barneys executive vice-president who oversees men's wear. \"He's very comfortable navigating through men's style and fashion.\"  \"Sports personalities are often style-obsessed, but not all of them can buckle down and create collaborations like these,\" said Simon Doonan,  Barneys \"creative ambassador at large.\" He starred with Mr. Westbrook in a cheeky video introducing the collection, which includes a line of glasses, Westbrook Frames, made with Selima eyewear. \"He was so into all the details and fabrications.\" Mr. Westbrook's partnership with Barneys will extend for two years\u2014four fashion seasons, to be exact. He is already at work on upcoming collections. But soon there will also be training camp and the preseason, and the attention of basketball's most adventurous dresser will again be divided. Over the summer, Mr. Westbrook became engaged to former UCLA women's basketball player Nina Earl. (Does he offer her style advice? \"Yeah, for sure,\" he said. \"A lot.\") "]

["China News", "Imports in December rose 3.1% from a year earlier, roughly in line with expectations, compared with a 6.7% gain in November. China\u2019s trade surplus narrowed last month more than expected to $40.82 billion from $44.61 billion in November. Overall in 2016, exports fell 7.7% and imports declined 5.5%, resulting in an annual trade surplus of $510 billion, below the $594.5 billion trade surplus in 2015. Chinese exports saw slipping demand across all major regions except the U.S., which saw a 5% increase, according to the customs data. Though economists said the weaker numbers also reflected a less favorable comparison with year-earlier data, when exports were relatively strong, anemic demand and trade tensions cloud the outlook for a return to more robust trade. \u201cOverall, exports will face challenges over the next couple of quarters,\u201d said RHB Group economist Fan Zhang. He said it is very likely a Trump administration will \u201cplay hardball\u201d with China. Chinese officials are sounding sober about the economic and political headwinds China is facing. Customs spokesman Huang Songping at a briefing on Friday called China \u201cthe biggest victim\u201d in the anti-globalization trend. Ministry of Commerce spokesman Sun Jiwen, a day earlier, cited mounting protectionism as a challenge and said that Beijing will \u201ctry all methods\u201d to stabilize trade, including steps to help exporters expand foreign markets and become more competitive.

During a recent trip to Europe, for example, he spent nearly two-thirds of conversations with auto executives. \u201cI love cars\u2014they\u2019re a passion of mine,\u201d he said before sheepishly adding that he drives a staid\n            Toyota\n            \n      Prius.

He pointed to the company\u2019s work in health care with Cancer Cloud, a collaborative project with Oregon Health and Science University that lets medical researchers share data while keeping parts of it private.

["Politics and Policy", "Ms. Yellen didn\u2019t persuade them. Though the Senate voted not to move forward with the bill\u2014a relief for the Fed\u2014only one of the chamber\u2019s 54 Republicans voted in the Fed\u2019s favor. Fed officials voted Wednesday to hold their benchmark federal-funds rate steady after a two-day policy meeting, and offered no hint about when they might move again or how Mr. Trump\u2019s economic proposals may affect the path of rates this year.  The political landscape has eroded for the Fed in recent years, and Ms. Yellen has struggled to confront the challenge.  Once revered as the masterminds of the U.S. economy, Fed policy makers now face the most intense political scrutiny in a generation. The path of monetary policy, which is emerging from a decade of basement-level rates, is being debated in the political arena in a way not seen since the Paul Volcker era in the 1980s. The person leading the institution isn\u2019t a politician\u2014she\u2019s a macroeconomist who spent most of her career at the Fed and in academia. Yet the task ahead of her, now that Donald Trump is president, might require a different set of skills. The new president thrust Ms. Yellen and the Fed onto the national political stage by criticizing them sharply during the campaign, and his election raised expectations that GOP bills to rein in the central bank could become law.  The president has also said he would probably find a replacement when Ms. Yellen\u2019s term is up in February 2018, which means he would likely nominate a successor by late summer, rendering her a lame duck."]
["Politics and Policy", "Proposals to more tightly oversee the Fed have been a staple since the financial crisis. Opposition from the Obama administration meant they had little chance of becoming law. That backstop is now gone. To compensate, Ms. Yellen has tried to build alliances in the Republican-controlled Congress. But her closest relationships on Capitol Hill are with Democrats, including liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), with whom she has spoken more than any other lawmaker. \u201cSuddenly, everybody is looking around going, \u2018Holy cow, maybe they\u2019re serious,\u2019 \u201d about Fed-related legislation, said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.), the former chairman of the House Monetary Policy Subcommittee who has sponsored a measure to overhaul the Fed. \u201cWe are serious. We\u2019ve been serious.\u201d Ideas include requiring the Fed to establish a mathematical formula to guide interest-rate policy, limiting its emergency-lending powers and forcing the central bank to return billions of dollars banks paid to be members of the Fed system. The phenomenon is apparent outside the U.S., too, with central banks from Japan to the U.K. grappling with skepticism of their efforts to boost their economies. Ms. Yellen has opposed such efforts, arguing they could hurt the Fed\u2019s ability to do its job of fostering a strong labor market and low, steady inflation. Though central bank officials missed signs of the impending financial crisis, their response helped avert a deeper depression, the Fed and its defenders have argued."]
["Politics and Policy", "Central bankers have long argued for independence from political pressure.\u00a0They say it allows them to make unpopular decisions they believe are best for the economy in the long run, such as raising rates to curb inflation even if it means slowing economic growth, as then-Fed Chairman Volcker did in the early 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that a central bank have the ability to make judgments about how best to pursue [its] goals while being accountable for explaining its decisions and transparent in its decision-making,\u201d Ms. Yellen told a congressional committee a week after the election. The financial crisis, however, battered the Fed\u2019s credibility.\u00a0Many lawmakers and some economists want more information about how the central bank operates and what it may do in the future. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said GOP legislation would provide \u201ca stronger foundation for economic growth than the Fed\u2019s improvisational approach of recent years.\u201d\u00a0He and others have chided the Fed for resisting those efforts. Though Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t said whether he would support the measures, his campaign remarks\u2014such as accusing Ms. Yellen of keeping rates low to help Democrats\u2014suggest he has no qualms about criticizing Fed policy or its leadership, a departure from the recent tradition of presidents staying mum on such issues. \u201cThe Fed is in serious trouble, no question about it,\u201d said Camden Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America. Ms. Yellen \u201cis going to have to kick into hyperdrive to try to mend fences and improve relations with both sides of the aisle.\u201d"]

Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio), listen as Janet Yellen testifies before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.Photo: Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images His successor, Ben Bernanke came from academia, but developed a rapport with members on both sides of the aisle during the crisis. Those relationships later helped him beat back legislative efforts to strip the Fed of its powers to supervise banks. Ms. Yellen served as chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Bill Clinton from 1997 to 1999, but spent the vast majority of her career working on the relationship between interest rates and the economy.  She has tried to shore up congressional support for the Fed over the past year, including broadening her outreach to potential allies, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of her calendar through November 2016, the most recent month for which it is available. The results have been mixed. She has met two dozen times with members of Congress since November 2015, either hosting them for breakfast or lunch in a private dining room at the Fed or shuttling to meetings on Capitol Hill, in addition to logging more than a dozen phone calls."]

She asks after lawmakers\u2019 family members and talks about her own\u2014she has one adult son who is also an economist. \u201cYou\u2019ve been someone that has been a delight to work with,\u201d former Sen. Dan Coats (R., Ind.), told Ms. Yellen on\u00a0Nov. 17 at his final hearing as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. Mr. Coats is now Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be the director of national intelligence. Still, some others who have sat in on meetings say Ms. Yellen sometimes comes across as unwilling to move from prepared talking points. Republicans have criticized her for meeting more often with Obama administration officials and Democratic lawmakers than with the GOP, and accused the Fed and its staff of being unresponsive in dealing with Congress. \u201cI like her. She\u2019s a nice person,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, who met with Ms. Yellen for lunch on\u00a0March 3. \u201cBut she hasn\u2019t reached out to me.\u201d"]
["Politics and Policy", "Ms. Yellen has offered to meet with members on both sides of the aisle during her testimony before Congress. Yet Mr. Huizenga, who led the subcommittee with primary oversight of the Fed in the last session of Congress, hasn\u2019t met with Ms. Yellen since June 2015. Though Mr. Huizenga said the Fed has always accommodated his requests for meetings, he expects the Fed to be doing the requesting. She spoke privately with Mr. Hensarling\u2014the chairman of the full committee\u2014just once last year, in a half-hour phone call in January 2016, according to her calendar. She didn\u2019t meet with former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) at all in 2016, the calendar indicates. By contrast, between November 2015 and November 2016, she met eight times with top Democrats overseeing the Fed: twice with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the Banking Committee\u2019s top Democrat; three times with Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee; and three times with Ms. Warren, a critic of the Fed\u2019s Wall Street oversight but an ally on its efforts to preserve independence. Ms. Yellen also met three times with Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), one of the few remaining Republicans to openly support the Fed\u00a0who has been known to call the chairwoman\u2019s office directly to chat. In total, she spoke privately with Republicans 19 times, compared with 20 meetings or phone calls with Democrats. She met more frequently with Democrats in person\u201416 sit-downs, compared with eight for Republicans\u2014and their meetings tended to last longer."]
["Politics and Policy", "She\u2019s had some successes. After the vote on the Audit the Fed bill, she met with several Senate Republicans, including Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), who had voted to advance the measure. Mr. Flake said in a recent interview he\u2019s having second thoughts about the bill. \u201cI\u2019ve supported it, but I do have concerns about going too far there,\u201d including worries about reducing the Fed\u2019s independence, he said. More typical is what happened when Congress considered tapping the Fed to help pay for federal highway programs. Ms. Yellen warned it could set a dangerous precedent. Congress took even more money from the Fed than initially proposed, including $19.3 billion from its capital account. \u201cThe Fed has become much more of a lightning rod,\u201d said Andy Laperriere, a policy analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro. Ms. Yellen\u2019s calendar suggests she has become more strategic over the past year. She has become more likely to meet lawmakers on their turf\u2014a gesture important to some of them\u2014and spoke more frequently with congressional leadership, including meetings or phone calls with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),\u00a0who has bonded with Ms. Yellen over their shared Brooklyn roots. She also spent more time meeting with lawmakers in the Senate, which has served as a brake on House efforts to change Fed operations."]
["Politics and Policy", "If Ms. Yellen is successful, the next round of Fed-related measures might not make it to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk. Most bills require 60 votes to advance in the Senate, and Republicans now hold 52 seats, two fewer than they did in the last Congress. \u201cOne of the problems the Fed has had\u2026was breaking through and speaking to ordinary people and convincing them that what it\u2019s been doing is in their interest as well,\u201d said former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn. \u201cShe needs to keep working on that.\u201d \u2014 Byron Tau contributed to this article.

Oakland, Calif.  To watch Stephen Curry play basketball is to witness a shooter unlike any the NBA has ever seen. Statistically, he is on his way to rewriting the NBA record book. Mechanically, he makes physicists marvel. Curry three-pointers are like everyone else\u2019s dunks: Only his misses are surprising.  Curry\u2019s touch also makes everything work for the Golden State Warriors, who have the league\u2019s best record at 21-3, despite having their 16-game win streak snapped Tuesday by the Memphis Grizzlies. It is a strategic advantage, regardless of opponent, each time they take the court. Curry\u2019s shooting ability\u2014like Michael Jordan\u2019s will and LeBron James\u2019s physique\u2014is now one of the deadliest weapons in the NBA.   Curry\u2019s career three-point average is 43.7%, which ranks third since the NBA introduced its three-point line in 1979. But that doesn\u2019t properly measure his value. Curry, who is only 26, is first among players who have tried more than 2,000 three-point shots. "]
["NBA", "But he doesn\u2019t shoot like most people, and what puzzles shooting gurus is why more players don\u2019t shoot like Curry. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said his father, Dell Curry, a former NBA guard. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to mimic Tiger Woods\u2019 golf swing\u2014but not Steph\u2019s jumper.\u201d Shooting is the most basic skill in basketball. So what, exactly, makes Curry the best? It is a question for the entire league, given Golden State\u2019s hot start, and for any aspiring NBA player, given Curry\u2019s remarkable development into a Most Valuable Player candidate. The surest shooters in NBA history all have their own theories.  \u201cHe happens to have maybe the best hand-eye coordination of anyone in the world,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in career three-point percentage. \u201cIt\u2019s the quick release,\u201d said former Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how close a defender is guarding him.\u201d  \u201cParents ask me: What\u2019s the key to getting my son to shoot like yours?\u201d Dell Curry said. \u201cRepetition. You have to have confidence you can do it, and that only comes by putting in work, and then doing it when the game\u2019s on the line.\u201d The answer is all that and more. Here is how the shot works. Curry quietly lifts off but stays so low that an Oxford English Dictionary could trip him. His kinetic efficiency comes from Curry shooting as he\u2019s jumping, rather than jumping and then shooting, which also lets him release the ball in as little as 0.3 second. "]
["NBA", "The result is a sharp arc that has become Curry\u2019s shooting hallmark. The average three-pointer this season reaches a maximum height of 15.77 feet, according to Stats LLC, which tracks such geospatial coordinates with high-resolution cameras in every NBA arena. Curry threes average 16.23 feet. This is the science to Curry\u2019s art: The steeper a shot, the wider the opening into the rim. Dallas Mavericks free-throw coach Gary Boren has a peculiar way of illustrating this fact. He lowers a hoop to the floor and has players climb a ladder. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the size of the ball,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can change the size of the target.\u201d  Curry\u2019s shot is mathematically optimal, said John Carter of Noah Basketball, whose technology has determined that the ideal entry angle for a three-point shot is about 45 degrees. Carter says the most skilled shooters he has studied use even higher trajectories. At the request of The Wall Street Journal, Lynchburg College physicist Eric Goff analyzed Curry\u2019s in-game threes and found that they entered the rim around 46 degrees.  Curry came to this shot in an unconventional way. Despite his genetic edge\u2014Curry\u2019s father was one of the NBA\u2019s purest shooters\u2014he wasn\u2019t expected to play much in college. The NBA was completely out of the question. \u201cOn every team he ever played on, he was the smallest guy, so he had to find ways to get around that,\u201d Dell Curry said. "]
["NBA", "Stephen Curry was still shooting from his waist in high school, but his father knew he needed to remake his shot to keep up with bigger and better players.  So he took a summer off from his usual basketball activities and focused on one tweak: changing his release point. By moving the ball above his head, Curry made his shots much harder to block, especially after a late growth spurt brought him to 6 feet 3.  Curry says that his shot has remained virtually the same since then. Its accuracy is extraordinary not only from three-point range but also the free-throw line, where he ranks fifth among qualified players at 89.8%.  But the NBA isn\u2019t full of Curry clones\u2014at least not yet\u2014because Curry\u2019s shot is also innate. \u201cTo try to shoot like Steph may make sense from a technical standpoint,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of like saying I\u2019d like to jump like Scottie Pippen.\u201d  Warriors forward Draymond Green was even more realistic. \u201cI can work as much as I want,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll never shoot like Stephen Curry.\u201d  The real key, Kerr believes, is neither the physics of Curry\u2019s shot nor the practice he put into it. It is the way Curry\u2019s brain interacts with the rest of his body\u2014his eye-hand coordination.  In his off-season workouts, Curry concentrates on \u201cneuromuscular overload,\u201d his trainer Brandon Payne said. One exercise, for example, consists of Curry tossing a tennis ball in the air, dribbling a basketball behind his back and catching the tennis ball before it hits the floor. "]
["NBA", "Curry, in his sixth season, finds himself in a conversation usually reserved for retiring players: How far is he from being universally recognized as the NBA\u2019s all-time three-point champion?  Kerr finished his career with a 45.4% average, but he was a role player who attempted fewer than 1,600 threes. Curry, a playmaker who creates threes off the dribble, has already taken more threes than Kerr and Hubert Davis, the only players with higher three-point percentages.  The other contender for that crown is Ray Allen, who has made 40% of 7,429 three-point shots\u2014by far the most made and attempted.  Curry, even if he plays 15 years, isn\u2019t on pace to surpass Allen in total attempts or three-pointers made. But he could become the first player to sink more than 41% or more of 6,000 three-pointers. As it stands, no one has made 41% or more of 4,000 threes.  There is a chance these two three-point legends could wind up this year on the same team. Allen, 39, currently isn\u2019t playing. But the Warriors this week said they contacted Allen\u2019s agent to see if he might want to join the NBA\u2019s newest title contender.

["Politics and Policy", "The spending plan unveiled Tuesday represents an 11% decrease from last year, and if enacted would be the lowest budget for the land and water agency\u00a0in five years. Hardest hit would be agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey, whose staffing would be slashed by nearly one-fifth amid a consolidation of climate change programs. The president\u2019s budget proposal is hardly a done deal, and likely to face resistance from Congress. But it offers a map of Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities and agenda.  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke defended the president\u2019s budget plan as being necessary to\u00a0allow the agency to return to its original mission of serving multiple uses for the nation\u2019s public lands and water. He said that includes \u201cresponsible\u201d energy development and conservation. Too much Interior spending, he said, has gone into programs that aren\u2019t needed and hurt rural communities. \u201cPresident Trump promised the American people he would cut wasteful spending and make the government work for the taxpayer again, and that\u2019s exactly what this budget does,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. The increased emphasis on oil and gas development would prove a boon to fossil fuel extractors, while cuts in science and range land management programs could provide regulatory relief to ranchers and the mining industry. Environmental groups assailed the spending plan and said it, along with a proposed 31% budget cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, would decimate land, water and air protections in this country."]
["Politics and Policy", "Among the other hot-button proposals in the Interior budget: a provision for future revenues from drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which many Republicans in Congress want to try again to open after failing in several attempts. \u201cSadly, this budget proposal shows that Trump is no different than the most extreme members of the Republican Party who have waged war on endangered species and environmental protection for years,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group based in Tucson, Ariz. The Interior budget seeks to sharply scale back a number of initiatives taken at the agency by the Obama administration. One of the most dramatic changes is the proposed pullback from science programs. Climate programs would be consolidated, leaving some agencies like the USGS with none at all. In a telephone briefing Tuesday, Mr. Zinke, a former Republican congressman from Montana, called many of those programs duplicative and said he personally believes climate change is real. \u201cI think the climate is changing, although the climate has always changed,\u201d Mr. Zinke said, adding more needs to be learned before taking actions that could hurt the economy. Among the president\u2019s priorities, he said, is addressing an estimated $12 billion backlog in deferred maintenance in the national parks. The budget would boost that spending in the next fiscal year by $35 million to $766 million. It also increases spending by $31 million to $532 million to help promote development of oil, gas and coal, such as by better permitting. "]
["Politics and Policy", "Mr. Zinke said money needed for the parks has fallen dramatically over the past decade as Interior has scaled back from offshore energy development, contributing to a fall in annual revenues from $18 billion to $2 billion. Spending on renewable energy projects, however, would be frozen at $78 million, which he called in line with current demand. Another agency that would see a big hit to its budget is the Bureau of Land Management, which has been at the center of high-profile battles with Western ranchers in recent years over grazing restrictions and other issues. Under the president\u2019s plan, BLM\u2019s budget would be cut about 15%, including big hits to programs such as wildlife and fisheries management. Oil and gas management funding, however, would increase.

["Markets Main", "The Saudi regulator had suspended Deloitte\u2019s local unit a year ago from doing any auditing work for listed companies in the kingdom while the regulator investigated the long-running case involving MMG. A spokeswoman for Deloitte\u2019s local unit, Deloitte & Touche Bakr Abulkhair & Co., acknowledged that the CMA decision related to an investigation of MMG, a former audit client of the firm.  \u201cWhile the CRSD\u2019s decision is disappointing, Deloitte & Touche Bakr Abulkhair & Co respects the CMA\u2019s important role in regulating the Saudi capital markets, and will always fully cooperate with the CMA and other regulators,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Deloitte\u2019s Saudi unit didn\u2019t say whether it would appeal the CMA decision.  The regulator\u2019s decision states that listed companies and entities authorized by the CMA refrain from engaging with Deloitte\u2019s local unit in relation to audit services for two years beginning in June 2016, the spokeswoman said. The decision also includes a financial penalty of 300,000 Saudi riyals ($80,000).  The decision doesn't extend to the firm\u2019s audit services being provided to non-CMA licensed entities in the kingdom, and doesn't affect its other services, Deloitte\u2019s Saudi unit said.  The CMA, which didn\u2019t name any of the parties penalized, said the resolution isn\u2019t final and parties involved can appeal it in 30 days after they receive it. Saudi Arabia opened its stock market to international investors last year to attract more foreign capital as it reshapes its economy in an era of cheap oil. The CMA regularly penalizes companies for various market violations, which many analysts see as a welcome move aimed at reassuring investors that Saudi Arabia is a safe place to do business."]
["Markets Main", "As part of the verdict issued on Wednesday, the CMA\u2019s legal committee ordered one of the defendants to pay 1.62 billion Saudi riyals ($432 million) for \u201cillegal profits\u201d in addition to a separate fine of 2.7 million riyals. The illegal profits represents the difference between the IPO share value and the real share value, the CMA said, noting the amount once collected will be paid to those who were affected by these violations. The legal committee also sentenced MMG founder Mohammad Al-Mojil and his son Adel, who serves as the company\u2019s chairman, to five years in jail for misrepresenting the firm\u2019s value at its IPO. A third executive received a three-year sentence. Mr. Mojil sold 30% of his MMG stake to the public in an IPO in 2008, reaping 2.1 billion Saudi riyals ($560 million). The Al-Mojil family on Friday denied wrongdoing and said they would appeal the legal committee\u2019s decision, which they called \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d Its members weren\u2019t formally interviewed by the CMA or given a chance to comment on the evidence used against them, the family claimed. MMG shares have been suspended from trading since July 2012, after investors began questioning its financial health as the firm began writing down the value of money it was owed for contracts while costs on projects ran over budget. MMG\u2019s shares were priced at 65 riyals each at the listing, but had plummeted to 12.55 riyals by mid-2012.  Write to Ahmed Al Omran at Ahmed.AlOmran@wsj.com"]

In the past few days, Florida\u2019s Speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran,  along with more than 70 other GOP lawmakers, have called on Mr. Scott to suspend Mr. Israel for incompetence and dereliction of duty. "]
["U.S. News", "In a letter to Mr. Scott, Mr. Corcoran cited numerous interactions the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office had with the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz,  as well as phone calls from individuals warning such an event was possible, and the failure of a deputy stationed at the school to enter the building during most of the shooting attack. Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School arrested for killing at least 17 students, has admitted to being the gunman, according to court records. We look back over the events that unfolded during the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012. Photo: Zuma Press The sheriff\u2019s office has said it received 23 calls related to Mr. Cruz and his family dating back to 2008. In the most recent call, at the end of November, the caller said Mr. Cruz was collecting guns and knives and believed he was a school shooter in the making, according to a log of the calls provided by the sheriff\u2019s office. The deputy who handled the call told the caller that Mr. Cruz no longer lived in Broward County, Sheriff Israel said in a letter sent Saturday to Mr. Scott. That deputy told the caller to notify the local law enforcement agency that Mr. Cruz was now living in Palm Beach County, the letter said. Mr. Corcoran\u2019s letter also noted that the governor has the power under the state constitution to suspend a sheriff for \u201cmalfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty or incompetence.\u201d "]
["U.S. News", "\u201cSheriff Israel\u2019s fundamental duty is to keep the peace and protect the citizens of Broward County,\u201d Mr. Corcoran wrote. \u201cAs a result of Sheriff Israel\u2019s failures, students and teachers died.\u201d Sheriff Israel said Sunday his office would fully cooperate with the probe that will be led by Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Rick Swearingen.  But Sheriff Israel also signaled he won\u2019t leave without a fight. \u201cThe day you can beat LeBron at basketball, that\u2019s the day I\u2019ll resign,\u201d he said in an interview.  Son of a homicide detective for the New York City Police Department, Sheriff Israel, 61 years old, began his career in law enforcement with the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, where he worked as a road patrol officer, in the narcotics division, and as SWAT commander. \u200b\u200b  When he was first elected as sheriff in 2012, running as a Democrat, rank-and-file deputies were happy to have a leader who had worked as a police officer, said Jeff Bell, the union representative for Broward County deputies. \u201cWe have a lot more respect to someone who\u2019s done the job rather than just a politician,\u201d said Mr. Bell. Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims. They said they weren\u2019t as pleased with Sheriff Israel\u2019s emphasis on de-escalating tense situations rather than using force in response to nationwide protests over the shooting of unarmed black men. "]
["U.S. News", "Meanwhile, Sheriff Israel has been lauded by other law-enforcement leaders for efforts including a program to put first-time non-violent teen offenders in programs rather than behind bars. He was re-elected in 2016. \u201cHe believes in reforming and changing the culture of law enforcement,\u201d said Juan Perez, Director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. \u201cHe\u2019s championed community-based policing in his agency.\u201d The sheriff faced a big test in January 2017 when a gunman opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, killing five and wounding six innocent bystanders. In that shooting, deputies quickly approached the gunman, but the sheriff\u2019s office was criticized for poor communication and for failing to set up a unified command, leading to confusion about who was in charge, according to a report released last year.  Sheriff Israel said he disagreed with the findings, adding that law enforcement agencies worked together well. He said the biggest lesson learned from the airport shooting was that emergency responders shouldn\u2019t rush to the scene in disorganized fashion once the killer was caught. Sheriff Israel is personally familiar with Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the latest attack took place. All three of his triplets graduated from the school in 2015, he said. Sheriff Israel said his agency is investigating claims made by Coral Springs, Fla., police officers that other deputies also were waiting outside the school. Also being investigated are two county deputies who possibly didn\u2019t do all they should have with two of the 23 calls about Mr. Cruz\u2019s troubling behavior before to the attack, he said."]
["U.S. News", "James Acquaroli, whose daughter Sheryl is a junior at Stoneman Douglas, said the news that one or potentially more deputies didn\u2019t enter the school building to confront the shooter \u201chas been a shock to say the least.\u201d He said it is especially disturbing given that Aaron Feis, the assistant football coach, apparently died while trying to save students. \u201cTo think he didn\u2019t have anything and just used what he could, and outside is supposedly a good guy with a gun and he didn\u2019t do anything\u2014I was beyond myself,\u201d Mr. Acquaroli said. Still, he said he doesn\u2019t think Sheriff Israel should resign over the neglect of one or more deputies. \u201cI really like him,\u201d Mr. Acquaroli said. \u201cI think he\u2019s done a good job.\u201d Steve Wind, whose son Alex is a junior at Stoneman Douglas, said more information about the law-enforcement response is needed before he can pass judgment.  \u201cIf they\u2019re waiting outside and not doing anything, then I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Mr. Wind, 57. \u201cBut I think an investigation needs to happen.\u201d  Write to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com, Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com  \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Mr. Macron said isolationism would lead to defeat. \u201cI represent the mind-set of conquest,\u201d he said."]
["Europe News", "A narrow victory for Mr. Macron would erode the authority of a candidate already relying on the support of millions of voters who reject his policies but who say they will vote for him anyway to bar Ms. Le Pen from reaching the presidency. A poll by BVA this week showed about two thirds of people intending to vote for Mr. Macron were doing so to block Ms. Le Pen or because they see him as the least-bad option. After casting his ballot in Ris-Orangis, 20 miles south of Paris, Maurice Attuil said he reluctantly voted for Mr. Macron. \u201cI didn\u2019t want either. I voted for Macron because we don\u2019t really have a choice. I don\u2019t want to vote for extremists.

["Europe News", "Mr. Macron\u2019s party was hit by a hacking scandal in the final moments of the campaign Friday evening when thousands of emails and documents purporting to come from the party were posted on the internet. En Marche said authentic documents obtained from the hacking of email accounts were mixed with fakes \u201cwith the goal of sowing doubt and disinformation.\u201d  The timing of the document dump Friday indicates the hackers calculated the leak to inflict maximum damage. Because of election laws in France, En Marche and Mr. Macron were prohibited from communicating about the authenticity of the documents Saturday and until all polls close Sunday at 8 p.m.  If Mr. Macron wins, the first hurdle he would face would be securing a majority in legislative elections in mid-June. His upstart political movement has refused to seal alliances with mainstream parties, and has only named a handful of candidates it intends to field in the 577 seats up for grabs.  If Mr. Macron fails to secure a majority, he would have to seek ad hoc alliances with opposition parties or could even be forced into a so-called \u201ccohabitation\u201d\u2014a form of power-sharing under which a prime minister from the opposition runs the government. \u201cMr. Macron is 39 years old and has come from nowhere to end up president.

It isn\u2019t the first time the National Front has reached the second round of a presidential election. In 2002, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, qualified for a runoff against conservative Jacques Chirac. After he lost with less than 18% of the vote, the National Front retreated to a protest movement.

She went after blue-collar votes by posing for photos with workers at a factory threatened with closure, just before Mr. Macron was due at the same site. She has struck an alliance with a smaller nationalist movement, and courted conservative voters by hammering her proposals on security and French identity."]

Are we really so much cleverer than the financiers of the past?\u201d Well, we weren\u2019t. Excessive leverage once again proved to be the weak point of our financial system. And wisdom does not seem to be on an upward trend."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "A decade on, one might expect that leverage would have been significantly reduced. And in the majority of large banks, that is indeed true. But the opposite is the case for much of the rest of our economy. Indeed, total debt relative to gross domestic product is higher now than it was immediately before the crisis. At the end of 2016, according to figures produced by the Bank for International Settlements, household and corporate debt in the world economy, as a share of GDP, amounted to 138%, compared with 115% at the end of 2007. For advanced economies, that ratio averaged 195% last year, compared with 183% at the end of 2007. And, with only a few exceptions, in most countries public debt rose significantly over the same period. So, indebtedness in the world is higher today than it was at the start of the financial crisis. Does this mean that we face another financial crisis, this time located not in the banking system but in the wider economy? After a lost decade with slow growth well below long-run potential, there are now signs that the world economy is picking up. Businesses and households are ready to return to steady, sustained growth. And central banks are anxious to raise interest rates to more-normal levels, both to rebalance economies and to create room to cope with unexpected downturns in the future. But after 10 years of relative stagnation, we could be in for a bumpy decade ahead, because of the only immutable law of economics\u2014double-entry bookkeeping. If asset values fall, then so too must total liabilities."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "For companies and banks, their assets are the future stream of earnings discounted back to the present, while their liabilities are the amounts owed to creditors (often short-term debts fixed in money terms) and the residual value of equity. So, as interest rates rise, the discount rate will increase and asset prices will fall relative to incomes. A squeeze on the value of total liabilities falls initially on the value of their equity, making it more difficult to borrow. But it also increases the likelihood that some companies and banks will default on their debts. We could see a sequence of defaults in different sectors of the economy and in different countries. Up until now, extraordinarily low interest rates mean that many borrowers have been able to continue to service their debt when in fact there is little prospect that the full value of the loan will be repaid. When the Bank of England conducted its first stress test of the U.K. banking system in 2013, we found that expected losses on loans were much higher than stated provisions. Unsustainably low interest rates over a long period have led to a significant imbalance in economies around the world. Whether excess capacity in the export sectors of Germany and China, or excess investment in residential and commercial property in the U.S. and U.K., much misplaced investment remains to be written off."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "Rising interest rates will reveal the true state of balance sheets that has been concealed by accounting rules that allow loans to be valued at their full value, provided those loans are currently being serviced. We shall see the force of what economist Joseph Schumpeter described as \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d an inevitable part of economic growth in a prosperous capitalist economy. That force is now needed to correct the misplaced pattern of investments induced by faulty market signals such as inappropriate exchange rates and excessively low interest rates. As we have seen many times over the past century\u2014from the financial crisis at the outbreak of the First World War to the events of 2007-08\u2014markets sometimes wake up to the true position at the last moment, and then seemingly small events can trigger a sharp change in sentiment and asset values. A few unconnected defaults could lead to a reappraisal of the effective leverage of the financial system. Although banks are better capitalized than a decade ago, they are still vulnerable to runs. And foreign banks are still heavily reliant on short-term dollar funding. That will lead to increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to enter into swap agreements. Understandably, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to make open-ended and indefinite commitments of that kind. So, governments will need to think carefully about the regulation of short-term liabilities of their banks denominated in U.S. dollars."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "We cannot know whether the process of writing down debt will, as we emerge from the excesses of the financial crisis, undermine the normal forces generating economic growth. And there will be plenty of investment opportunities for those able to spot the companies and sectors in which expansion will occur, and plenty of pitfalls for the unwary who think we are merely recovering from an unusually long but traditional business-cycle downturn. Over the next decade, our economic journey will take us along an interesting and bumpy road.

"]
["Oil Markets", "Yet questions have arisen about how much non-OPEC countries such as Russia, which have promised to reduce output by a combined 558,000 barrels a day, will enforce the cuts. Some oil-market watchers also believe trends in demand might be working against the petroleum cartel. After years of healthy growth fueled by low prices and Asia\u2019s expanding appetite, demand for oil next year could increase at its slowest pace since 2014, some analysts say. In its first monthly market report since the reduction was agreed, the 13-member group said the \u201cOPEC production adjustment alone wouldn't be enough to clear the total overhang\u201d of 300 million barrels, or 0.8 million barrels a day, currently in storage. \u201cThis clearly emphasizes the importance of non-OPEC producers\u2019 contribution to the production adjustment in support of market rebalancing.\u201d If both sides heed their pledges, it \u201cwill accelerate the reduction of global inventories and bring forward the rebalancing of the oil market to the second half of 2017,\u201d it said. The production cuts would bring production to the level of crude OPEC says the market need from its members in the second quarter\u2014which is just under 32 million barrels a day. If the six-month OPEC ceiling of 32.5 million a day was extended to the whole year, it would bring \u201ca slight stock draw of 0.1 million barrels a day in 2017, leading to a reduction in excess supply and an acceleration of the stock draw,\u201d the group said Wednesday."]
["Oil Markets", "The numbers contained in the report show both OPEC and non-OPEC producers have a long way to go to carry out the cuts. The 13-member bloc increased output by about 150,000 barrels a day last month to 33.87 million barrels a day, based on independent data used by the group.

Non-OPEC oil supply in 2017 is expected to grow by 0.30 million barrels a day over 2016 after OPEC revised the upgraded the forecast by 70,000 barrels a day. A large part of that growth would be driven by a boost in production from Kazakhstan and Russia, two countries that have pledged to join the OPEC cuts. According to OPEC\u2019s current forecast, Kazakh production will rise by about 210,000 barrels a day, compared with a commitment to cut by 20,000 barrels a day, and Russia\u2019s will increase by about 80,000 barrels a day, instead of a promised reduction of 300,000 barrels a day.

["Markets Main", "That is because those big banks, such as\n            Wells Fargo\n            \n      & Co., typically pay higher effective tax rates than companies that are much more profitable, such as\n            Apple\n Inc.\n      Banks in the S&P 500 pay an effective 25% rate, versus an 18% rate for information technology firms, the data provider said. Aside from the overall corporate tax rate, bank investors were also concerned with how legislators would limit the deductibility of interest costs. On the face of it, that could upend the banking model since financial firms are highly leveraged, deploying huge amounts of debt to themselves, make loans or buy instruments like bonds. Given that, interest expense for banks is akin to nonfinancial companies\u2019 cost of goods sold. The legislation proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee appears to let banks sidestep that issue, though. It does so by limiting the deductibility for companies that spend more money on interest than they take in, said Mark Roe, a professor at Harvard Law School. Banks by and large bring in far more in interest than they pay out. The upshot is that the change shouldn\u2019t affect banks or result in them paying more for debt that ranges from deposits to long-term bonds."]

["Technology", "Snap\u2019s metamorphosis reflects a growing need among social-media firms to be more than just networks of friends. Mark Zuckerberg,  the chief executive of\n            Facebook\n Inc.,\n      Snap\u2019s biggest competitor, last week outlined in a 6,000-word manifesto his ambition to turn the 13-year-old social network into the backbone of a new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d so it can address some of the world\u2019s biggest problems, like terrorism, disease and climate change. Facebook has also invested in virtual reality, betting it will be the next major computing platform.

Photo: Zuma Press \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n Inc.\n      has broader ambitions too. This month, Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said the social-media platform, known for its brief messages, has been trying to refocus itself as the world\u2019s fastest place to get news. For Snap, articulating a different vision helps differentiate the company from Facebook, which has a larger user network than Snapchat, and Twitter. Facebook has mimicked several Snapchat features in the past year, including Stories, a collection of images that disappear, on its photo-sharing app Instagram.

["Technology", "Mr. Spiegel is also wary of being overly dependent on\n            Apple\n Inc.\n      and Google\u2019s Android, whose phones, with their built-in cameras, are the primary tool for using Snapchat, according to a former Snap employee.  Even though the first line of Snap\u2019s initial public offering document claims \u201cSnap Inc. is a camera company,\u201d investors say they are evaluating Snap through a media and entertainment lens. The valuation that Snap is seeking in its IPO\u2014between $19.5 billion and $22.2 billion\u2014reflects a sales multiple similar to Facebook and Twitter when they went public.  \u201cSnap isn\u2019t a camera company,\u201d says Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \u201cCamera companies sell cameras.

["Technology", "\u201cCameras have evolved from being just a piece of hardware, like a chip, to software that is connected to the internet,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said in a video that Snap published a week ago for its roadshow. \u201cWith Snapchat, the camera has become the primary input for the phone.\u201d   The ephemerality at Snapchat\u2019s core when it launched in 2011 as a messaging platform for disappearing photos established a new way of digital social interaction. In the past, content on the internet such as emails and photos was considered permanent, and people didn\u2019t know who was seeing it, Mr. Spiegel said in the roadshow video. Two years later, Snap updated its app with Stories, the feature for collections of pictures and videos that disappear in 24 hours. This made the short-lived messages available for anyone to see, beyond people\u2019s networks of friends. Karen North, director of the social media program at the University of Southern California, described this as Snapchat\u2019s \u201cgenius pivot,\u201d because it took the carefree feeling that Snapchat had created and broadened it beyond messaging. \u201cBefore, Snaps were just messages to people,\u201d Ms. North says. \u201cThen they gave people an opportunity to tell a story.\u201d When Snap Inc. goes public, Snapchat co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will retain control of more than 90% of the company's voting rights.

["Technology", "Snap then focused on making photos or videos on its platform interactive, which was one of the first introductions of augmented reality to a mainstream audience. In 2015, Snap launched Lenses\u2014filters that blend computer images into real photos\u2014that packaged augmented reality into tools that added bunny faces, talking tacos, monsters and vomiting rainbows onto regular selfies. The Lenses also created a lucrative advertising opportunity, allowing brands to buy a presence on Snapchat. While Snap was rolling out these enhancements to its social media tool, Mr. Spiegel had something bigger in mind. Worried about being so dependent on smartphones made by other companies, Mr. Spiegel wanted to migrate the app onto other devices. He began hinting at his interest in cameras, expressing admiration for Polaroid founder Edwin Land at a technology conference in 2015. Snap launched Spectacles, its first gadget, in November, slightly more than a year after the failure of\n            Alphabet\n Inc.\u2019s\n      Google Glass. Google\u2019s head-mounted device drew ridicule and raised privacy concerns for its ability to surreptitiously record video. Snap, on the other hand, devised a circular light to indicate when the Spectacles are recording.  \u201cSnap is the first company that has gotten people to wear a camera on their face and made it cool,\u201d says Matt Miesnieks, a partner at venture-capital firm Super Ventures, which hasn't invested in Snap."]
["Technology", "Still, good looks may not be enough to convince investors Snap has a vision beyond social messaging. In its public filing document, Snap cautioned that it could be hard to justify its spending if new products fail to engage users. \u201cThere is no guarantee that investing in new lines of business, new products, and other initiatives will succeed,\u201d the company said.

["NBA", "The Warriors have accomplished one of the greatest runs in NBA history over the last three seasons. They have won more games in that time than any team ever, and now they have two championships after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the Finals on Monday for a 16-1 postseason record. There is a serious case to be made for the Warriors becoming a dynasty. And it\u2019s partly because they believed in not taking themselves seriously. \u201cWe\u2019re always in search of something funny,\u201d said Golden State assistant coach Bruce Fraser.  The Warriors were loose because they won, but they also won because they were loose. Sports teams packed with highly paid professional athletes and their egos can be notoriously difficult to manage. It may seem obvious that adding Kevin Durant to a team already loaded with superstars last offseason would bring the championship back to Golden State. It could just as easily have created dissonance. But in Kerr, the Warriors have a coach who, before Game 4 of the Finals, greeted his team with a locker room message reading: \u201cI want you to go out there and play with great joy. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d It\u2019s a notion that has quietly spread throughout professional sports in recent years. Many teams are miserable to be around. The Warriors are the opposite.

Like most of his teammates, McGee was the butt of a common Draymond Green joke: posting pictures of the Warriors napping on social media. Unlike most of his teammates, McGee decided to strike back. He went on the website Shutterfly. He uploaded a photo of Green sleeping with his mouth open. He printed that photo on blankets and distributed them to the team. Then Green printed McGee\u2019s face on toilet paper. That made them even. \u201cUntil we\u2019re uneven again,\u201d McGee said then. Their humor, like their offense, was egalitarian. Zaza Pachulia decided that Zaza Pachulia outscoring Klay Thompson in a playoff game was a historic occasion worthy of commemoration.

After the only losing streak of the season, for example, the song they blasted at practice was Bobby McFerrin\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy.\u201d"]

Scholars have found that employees in funnier business environments are better at their jobs and happier when they\u2019re in the office. Jessica Mesmer-Magnus, a University of North Carolina at Wilmington management professor, was the co-author of a study published by the Journal of Managerial Psychology that showed humor positively correlates with work performance. \u201cOne conclusion derived from these findings,\u201d the paper says, \u201cmight be that organizations should attempt to cultivate humor within the workplace.\u201d A similar conclusion could be derived from this NBA season\u2014and the two seasons before that, and maybe the next two seasons, too.

Russia said its initial strikes inside Syria on Wednesday were aimed at Islamic State targets. But senior U.S. officials cast doubt on those claims. The U.S. spy agency has been arming and training rebels in Syria since 2013 to fight the Assad regime. Rebels who receive support under a separate arming and training program run by the Pentagon weren\u2019t in areas targeted by Russia in its initial strikes, the officials said.  The combination of unpredictable, unilateral action that flouted Western exhortations posed an unmistakable resemblance to Ukraine, where Mr. Putin moved to annex the Crimea region and has defied international demands to halt its support for separatists. Mr. Putin\u2019s decision-making in Syria mirrors the way he has approached Ukraine, said Andrew Weiss,  vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace."]
["Middle East News", "\u201cHe deliberately tries to do things to throw opponents off balance and he\u2019s always trying to get some sort of element of surprise and tactical advantage over people, that\u2019s sort of what keeps him going is this constant springing surprises and flipping events in his favor,\u201d said Mr. Weiss, who worked on Russia policy in the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. Russia is also playing a greater military role in Iraq, which is threatened by Islamic State and aided by the U.S.-led coalition. Iraq agreed this week to share intelligence with Russia, the Syrian regime and Iran to counter Islamic State.  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he would welcome Russian airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq as long as they are coordinated with the U.S.-led coalition. \u201cIf the Russians are prepared to join the international coalition, which is helping Iraq, they\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said in a PBS interview. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the first indications he had on the Russian strikes is that they didn\u2019t target areas controlled by Islamic State. At a United Nations summit in New York, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the targets were still unclear. \u201cThey are the first Russian airstrikes as far as we\u2019re aware, so the selection of targets won\u2019t have been accidental or random,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are clearly ISIL targets far away from any regime activity, that will send one signal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are targets that look more like defense of regime forces than attack on ISIL forces, that will send a very different signal.\u201d"]
["Middle East News", "American officials were taken aback by Russia\u2019s decision to announce the strikes by sending a three-star Russian general to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday. The general gave U.S. officials an hour\u2019s notice before he arrived, delivered the message that Russia was going to start bombing, said American aircraft should get out of Syrian airspace and left, American officials said. One defense official called it \u201cunprofessional.\u201d Another called it unproductive. U.S. officials said they didn\u2019t alter their airstrike and surveillance missions over Syria as a result of Russia\u2019s attacks. But the lack of coordination makes it more challenging to avoid potential confrontations. U.S. defense officials said they are still trying to set up meetings with their Russian counterparts to discuss ways to prevent a direct conflict between the two global military powers. But Wednesday\u2019s attacks cast a shadow over the hopes for the discussions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a willing partner to come to the table and tell you the truth,\u201d said a senior military official.  Russia has built up its military presence in Syria in recent weeks to support Mr. Assad after he suffered a series of battlefield setbacks and acknowledged publicly that he could no longer hold on to all of the country after more than four years of war. During the buildup, Moscow said its intent was to fight Islamic State and conflated opponents of the regime with terrorists. "]
["Middle East News", "U.S. defense officials said that Russia now has 32 planes stationed at an airfield near the Syrian coast. Along with jet fighters, Russia has 16 helicopters, nine tanks, at least two surface-to-air missile defense systems and enough housing for up to 2,000 people, U.S. officials said. Moscow and Syrian state media claimed Russia\u2019s initial strikes hit areas under Islamic State control. The Syrian state news agency said the targets were in the central provinces of Homs and Hama. However, most of the areas that state media listed as targets aren\u2019t known to be Islamic State-held territory.  Airstrikes on Wednesday also struck the ancient city of Palmyra and the nearby village of Qaryatain in Homs province, both held by Islamic State. However, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether they were Syrian regime or Russian bombings. Syrian state media claimed they were carried out by Mr. Assad\u2019s air force. Anti-Assad activists on the ground said they were more powerful than any regime airstrikes until now, leading them to believe they were Russian.  Among seven areas that Syrian state media listed as targets of Russian strikes, only one\u2014an area east of the town of Salamiyah in Hama province\u2014has a known presence of Islamic State fighters. The other areas listed are largely dominated by moderate rebel factions or Islamist groups such as Ahrar al-Sham and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.  Defense officials criticized Russia\u2019s decision to hit Homs instead of somewhere like Raqqa, the de facto Islamic State capital in northeastern Syria."]
["Middle East News", "\u201cThis is not downtown Raqqa,\u201d one senior defense official said of the areas Russian planes hit. \u201cThis is not an ISIL stronghold.\u201d Syrian activists said the town of Talbiseh, about 10 miles north of the city of Homs, along with several surrounding villages bore the brunt of the bombardment. The area has been besieged by regime forces for several years. At least 27 people, including six children and five women, were killed in the strikes on Talbiseh, opposition activists said.  The dominant factions in Talbiseh and the nearby town of al-Rastan are tied to the Free Syrian Army, the Western-backed rebel umbrella group that includes many Syrian army defectors. The commander of one FSA faction named Tajamu al-Ezzeh said Russian warplanes targeted his fighters in Hama province, according to a video statement released by the group.

["Middle East News", "\u201cThe liberation of Tikrit was carried out by the efforts of the Iraqi army and police, public mobilization units, tribal forces and the people of Tikrit city,\u201d Mr. Abadi said on state television. \u201cIt was carried out under air cover and concentrated bombardment by the Iraqi air force, army air force and the international coalition against the terrorists of ISIS.\u201d U.S. officials monitoring the fight for Tikrit from Baghdad agreed that the three-month operation appeared to have been largely successful but said more fighting lay ahead, as Iraqi forces move to search for hidden insurgent fighters and search for hidden improvised explosive devices. Tuesday\u2019s advances in Tikrit were a major symbolic and strategic victory for Iraq\u2019s beleaguered military and its Shiite militia allies against the Sunni militants, who devastated the country\u2019s security forces when they swallowed up about a quarter of the country last summer.

Capturing Tikrit also pushes Islamic State further from the capital Baghdad."]
["Middle East News", " Hadi al-Ameri,  the head of the mostly Shiite militias, who played a central role in the Tikrit operation, told reporters on Tuesday that militias would now head to Iraq\u2019s western Anbar province to \u201cliberate it from the terror of Islamic State.\u201d \u201cThe successful experience of Tikrit will be repeated in other areas,\u201d said Mr. Abadi, who lauded the security forces for their \u201cprotection of civilians\u201d and for the few casualties among their ranks. The battle exposed a struggle between the U.S. and Iran over political influence over the government in Baghdad. The fight pitted tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers and Iranian-backed Shiite militias against a few hundred Islamic State militants. Iraq began its attack without alerting the U.S. or its partners in a coalition that had been launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria since last autumn. Instead, Iran played a leading role, commanding Shiite militias and providing weapons. After a rapid initial advance, the militias stalled inside Tikrit, where Islamic State fighters were holed up in Mr. Hussein\u2019s former palaces. The pause prompted the Iraqi government to turn to Washington for aerial support. Washington agreed to launch airstrikes only if the Iranian-backed militias were sidelined. Baghdad\u2019s request for Washington\u2019s support infuriated the Shiite militias, who felt the airstrikes undermined their credibility on the ground. The most powerful militias threatened to pull out of the fighting in protest over the snub."]
["Middle East News", "In the end, U.S. officials said that Iranian-backed militias didn\u2019t play a role in Tuesday\u2019s assault, with only about 200 Shiite volunteers in the 4,000-man force that swept into the city. All of those Shiite volunteers, said the U.S. defense official, were under the command of the Iraqi security forces.  Iranian-backed Shiite militias disagreed. They said many of their fighters returned to the front lines Monday after Iraqi officials assured them that the U.S. would halt its airstrikes.  In the hours that followed Mr. Abadi\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, both the Iranian-linked Shiite militias and the U.S. military tried to lay claim to the successful operations in Tikrit. In comments to reporters in front of Saddam\u2019s palace in central Tikrit, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes,  the leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbullah Brigades, stressed the militias\u2019 singular role in subduing the city and dismissed concerns about lingering Islamic State elements. \u201cWe need a couple of days just to clean the city from explosives or any remaining ISIS militants or pockets,\u201d Mr. Mohandes said, using an acronym for Islamic State. \u201cOur aim now is to bring life back to this city.\u201d American officials sought to use their entry into the fight for Tikrit last week as an opportunity to show Baghdad\u2019s government that it should partner with the U.S., not Tehran, in the fight against Islamic State. \u201cIraq is going to have to decide who they want to partner with,\u201d said one senior U.S. defense official. \u201cWe\u2019ve been demonstrating all across the country, and now in Tikrit, that we are a good and able partner.\u201d"]

["U.S. News", "The requirements were part of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to combat global climate change. But the auto industry contends they\u2019ll be difficult to achieve as low gas prices boost sales of pickup trucks and sport utilities and objected to the EPA\u2019s decision to complete them in the Obama administration\u2019s waning days well before an April 2018 deadline.  On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said his move would preserve jobs as he spoke to auto workers in Michigan. In his letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, the Democratic California governor called the reversal \u201can unconscionable gift to polluters.\u201d \u201cCalifornia will take the necessary steps to preserve the current standards and protect the health of our people and the stability of our climate,\u201d Mr. Brown said in his letter to auto-manufacturers. Mr. Brown has made climate change a signature issue of his administration and has already promised to fight any attempts by the new president to roll back the state\u2019s policies combating climate change. California has a waiver from the EPA to set its own standards for tailpipe emissions but currently aligns them with U.S. standards as part of a national program attempting to provide car makers with uniform regulations as opposed to a patchwork among states and Washington.  During his confirmation hearings Mr. Pruitt wouldn't commit to granting the state that decades-old authority again, provoking the ire of California officials. During a briefing Tuesday, a senior administration official told reporters the administration wouldn't seek to change that waiver for now, but didn\u2019t rule it out altogether."]

There is a more extreme, and permanent, maneuver: renouncing U.S. citizenship outright. People considering that should be aware that the process can be long, complex and costly, tax experts say. Here are some issues to be aware of. Renouncers must certify that they have been tax-compliant for the last five years\u2014and sometimes produce the returns to prove it. For this reason, renouncing citizenship isn\u2019t a ready solution for coping with past tax errors, tax experts say."]
["Property Report", "Some would-be expatriates owe a hefty exit tax. The law treats many renouncers as having sold all their world-wide assets on the day before the renunciation, even if the person will continue to own the property and pay tax on it.  The exit tax applies to renouncers whose net assets are greater than $2 million or whose average annual income tax has been greater than about $160,000 for the last five years. Net capital gains are taxable at rates up to 23.8%. Special rules apply for pensions, trusts and accounts such as individual retirement accounts, but they are taxable. There are some exceptions to this tax, such as for people who have been dual citizens from birth. (For more information, see the instructions to IRS Form 8854.) Expatriation usually requires one or more exit interviews with consular officials, although often the conversations are brief unless there are irregularities. The law also requires the names of U.S. citizens who give up their passports to appear on a list published quarterly by the Treasury Department, which some people might consider embarrassing. Heirs could owe big tax bills. The U.S. heirs of wealthy taxpayers who renounce their citizenship often owe a stiff inheritance tax on bequests from them. (This provision doesn\u2019t apply to spouses of expatriates who are U.S. citizens.) For example, say a woman worth $6 million renounces her citizenship and becomes a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis. If she leaves each of her three American children $2 million, each will owe about $800,000 of federal tax on the bequest, Mr. Hodgen says."]
["Property Report", "Travel abroad might become complicated, with more visas required\u2014even to the U.S. If an expatriate wants to return to the U.S., it might be difficult for him or her to spend more than 120 days a year (on average) here without becoming a taxpayer. And the expatriate must not appear to be using a visitor\u2019s status to live in the U.S. Under a provision known as the \u201cReed Amendment,\u201d U.S. officials can deny entry to any person who has renounced citizenship for tax reasons.

["Asia News", "Myanmar has denied such accounts, amid international pressure on the country and its civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi,  to begin taking back the refugees, whom it denies citizenship and regards as illegal immigrants. The announcement of the agreement comes ahead of a visit to both countries by Pope Francis, who has called for the Rohingya to receive their \u201cfull rights.\u201d More than 600,000 Rohingya refugees are stranded in Bangladesh after fleeing violence in Myanmar. Their fate is uncertain and the world is watching to see whether Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi will take action on the humanitarian crisis. Video: Karan Deep Singh / Photo: Getty Images The repatriation process will likely move slowly and may do little to diminish global concern over the crisis. Myanmar said the agreement signed on Thursday is based on a 1990s accord between the two countries that provided for the return of Rohingya refugees after an earlier outbreak of violence. That arrangement allowed only for the return of people able to prove their residency in Myanmar. That will be difficult for refugees who fled with little more than the clothes they were wearing. Myanmar\u2019s minister of social welfare and resettlement, Win Myat Aye, said recently that the government could verify as many as 300 potential returnees a day. At that rate, the process would take years. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned of possible sanctions against Myanmar and described the Myanmar military\u2019s clearance of Rohingya villages as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d echoing language used by the United Nations and some other governments."]
["Asia News", "China also has encouraged the two countries to strike a deal allowing Rohingya to return, and has emphasized that the international community shouldn\u2019t interfere.  Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to begin the repatriation process by the end of January, said Reyad Hossain, first secretary at the Bangladesh Embassy in Yangon. More details are to be released over the weekend, an official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called on Myanmar in recent months to \u201ctake their nationals back.\u201d She told lawmakers this week that Dhaka is committed to taking steps to send the Rohingya back \u201cto their homeland,\u201d local media reported. Myanmar responded to international pressure in a statement about the repatriation agreeement, saying it saw the situation as an issue to be worked out with Bangladesh. It said Western nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation \u201chad portrayed the matter as an international issue,\u201d with U.N. resolutions and a Security Council statement. \u201cThe principled position of Myanmar is that issues that emerge between neighboring countries must be resolved amicably through bilateral negotiations,\u201d the statement said. Some aid agencies operating in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state, where some 1.1 million Rohingya lived before August\u2019s crackdown began, have suggested the agreement could falter without any international oversight. Myanmar also plans to bar Rohingya from lands they farmed before the clearances began. It instead intends to settle returnees in \u201cmodel villages,\u201d which the U.N. has previously warned would be little better than creating permanent camps."]

"]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cHe was in a critical position. But now he is much stronger, everyone is happy about the success of his leadership,\u201d said Walid al Hilli,  a senior ally of Mr. Abadi within their Shiite Dawa party. \u201cDaesh was in Baghdad in 2014\u2014and now the Iraqi army is entering the last part of Iraq that\u2019s still outside the control of the government,\u201d Mr. Hilli added, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.   While the battle is tough, particularly in Mosul\u2019s densely populated urban areas, Iraqi and Kurdish forces have made rapid progress since the operation kicked off in late October. They have already seized large tracts of Islamic State-held countryside, expelled the militant group from several smaller towns and encircled Iraq\u2019s second-largest city.   Completing the operation and finding a political balance between the various factions that vie to control Mosul after Islamic State\u2019s domination ends would further cement Mr. Abadi\u2019s stature, allowing him to retain power until elections planned for 2018 and possibly beyond.  Conversely, if the final stages of the Mosul campaign go awry and the country descends into a fresh round of infighting, Mr. Abadi would be the one held responsible. His political foes, particularly former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki,  already are lying in wait for such an opportunity to pounce. So far, however, Mr. Abadi has deftly navigated Iraq\u2019s fractious political landscape, placing himself above the bickering among the parties in parliament and using the fact that the country is currently without the ministers of defense, interior, or finance to amass more authority for his own office."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cThis prime minister has a very cool head. He faced very difficult circumstances and he came through them,\u201d said Sajad Jiyad,  managing director of the Al Bayan Center for Planning and Studies, a think tank in Baghdad. \u201cAbadi has proven to be quite independent, he\u2019s doing things his own way, he plays his cards close to his chest, resists pressure, and keeps a cool head. If Abadi is doing a good job it won\u2019t be easy to replace him.\u201d Mr. Abadi\u2019s most dangerous political rival, Mr. Maliki, ruled Iraq for eight years before Iraq\u2019s parliament replaced him, under Western pressure, in September 2014, after Islamic State\u2019s takeover of Mosul. Currently holding the largely ceremonial title of Iraq\u2019s vice president, Mr. Maliki still retains broad support among lawmakers and, in recent months, broadened his alliances beyond the Shiite parties to include a growing number of prominent Kurdish and Sunni Arab lawmakers. An Iraqi army tank advanced toward the town of Qara Tappa, during fighting between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants southeast of Mosul on Nov. 23.Photo: Felipe Dana/Associated Press In an interview, Mr. Maliki said he doesn\u2019t seek to return to the prime minister\u2019s office himself. But, when asked whether Mr. Abadi should be ousted once the Mosul operation is completed, he replied affirmatively: \u201cThe Iraqis want change.\u201d Mr. Maliki also voiced concern that the rivalry for control over Mosul could create a \u201cdangerous situation even here in Baghdad.\u201d He accused Mr. Abadi of being too indecisive in confronting Turkey, the Kurdish government and its territorial aspirations, and the followers of Shiite cleric Muqtada al Sadr, who invaded the Green Zone and almost toppled the government in April and May."]
["Middle East Crossroads", "\u201cThis weakened the image of the government before the people and the security forces. When gangs can enter the center of legislative authority and the prime minister\u2019s office, this means there is no respect left for the state,\u201d Mr. Maliki said. \u201cWhat I want is to be a participant in setting up a strong government with national values that opposes sectarianism and the gangs. \u201d Mr. Maliki\u2019s parliamentary supporters were the ones to spearhead no-confidence votes that ousted Iraq\u2019s key government ministers in August and September. Since then, these positions have remained unfilled because the bickering factions in parliament are unable to find mutually acceptable candidates.  Surprisingly, that episode only made Mr. Abadi\u2019s job more secure, argued Dhiaa al-Assadi, head of the parliamentary bloc of followers of Mr. Sadr, the Shiite cleric who organized the Green Zone protests. As much as the Sadrists have issues with Mr. Abadi, they are far more hostile to Mr. Maliki, who launched a major military operation to reclaim the southern city of Basra from the Sadrist militias in 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to think of changing Mr. Abadi because of so many external and internal factors,\u201d Mr. Assadi said in an interview. \u201cIf it\u2019s proving so difficult to nominate another minister for a ministry, how can we do it with a prime minister?\u201d  Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com  \n              {{summary.headline}}\n            "]

DACA provides work permits and safe harbor from deportation to about 690,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, often known as Dreamers.

The price could crash, after surging 1,600% this year. With this week\u2019s launch of bitcoin futures, there is a new danger to worry about: the threat of manipulation involving futures markets. Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets Inc. launched the first bitcoin futures on Sunday, and its larger, crosstown rival CME Group Inc. is set to follow suit this weekend. Both exchange operators say they designed their futures contracts to reduce the risk of manipulation, and they plan to conduct surveillance to ensure it isn\u2019t happening.  So why are some people worried that bitcoin futures could be manipulated? "]
["Markets Main", "There is a long history of alleged manipulations in futures markets, going back to the wheat squeezes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In those, one or more firms would hide or remove grain from the market, driving up the price of futures contracts. In a fundamental way, bitcoin futures manipulation would resemble those old-time squeezes: Unscrupulous traders would engage in chicanery in the underlying \u201cphysical\u201d market for bitcoin in order to reap profits from the futures.  I\u2019m confused. What do you mean by \u201cphysical\u201d bitcoin?  Bitcoin is purely digital, so it isn\u2019t physical in the same sense as oil or gold. But like those commodities, it is traded globally in many different marketplaces. The constant back-and-forth between buyers and sellers on bitcoin exchanges like Bitfinex or GDAX determines how many dollars one bitcoin costs. This is what traders call the \u201cspot\u201d price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, bitcoin futures\u2014as the name suggests\u2014allow you to bet on what bitcoin\u2019s\u00a0price will be in the future. For instance, the most popular bitcoin contract on Cboe right now expires Jan. 17. So if you think the price of bitcoin will rise by mid-January, you can buy the contract, or go \u201clong.\u201d If you expect bitcoin to fall, you can sell the contract, or go \u201cshort.\u201d The virtual currency bitcoin continues surging to new highs as a frenzy of investors get in on the action. WSJ's Paul Vigna explains what you need to know, and how to invest should you want to join the mania. Photo: Alexander Hotz/The Wall Street Journal."]
["Markets Main", " So how would bitcoin futures manipulation work?  The scenario most often discussed involves pushing around the price of bitcoin when the futures contract expires. This is a classic scheme often called \u201cbanging the close.\u201d Let\u2019s say you bought 100 Cboe bitcoin contracts expiring in January. The final value of these contracts is set by a daily auction held at 4 p.m. ET on Gemini, a bitcoin spot exchange. The idea behind Gemini\u2019s auction is to bring together many buyers and sellers to determine a benchmark bitcoin price for that day. But suppose you heavily bought bitcoins in the Jan. 17 Gemini auction, offering to pay an abnormally high price. That could skew the benchmark higher, inflating the value of your 100 bitcoin futures contracts. Such a scheme would be tough to execute if there were large numbers of participants in the auction, because it would take a big purchase to boost the benchmark. Also, other traders could see that you were paying above-market prices in the auction and try to profit by selling to you\u2014which would lower the benchmark to more reasonable levels. But Gemini\u2019s volumes are thin: From January to November, an average of $1.3 million in bitcoin changed hands in the auction each day, a sliver of the billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin traded daily. That has raised fears that a relatively small amount of trading could move the auction price. Cboe and Gemini say they expect auction volumes to grow. "]
["Markets Main", "Gemini, unlike some overseas bitcoin exchanges, also requires customers to submit proof of identity before they can trade on the platform. That means it and Cboe could identify any manipulators and refer them to the authorities. Another deterrent: Cboe limits the size of futures trades you can have near expiration, which reins in the potential profit from banging the close. \u201cWe have robust measures in place to preserve the fair and orderly trading of our bitcoin futures contracts,\u201d a Cboe spokeswoman said. Gemini referred questions to Cboe.  How about CME\u2019s bitcoin futures? Could they be manipulated?  Perhaps. But it would take significant effort to avoid the exchange\u2019s countermeasures. CME\u2019s futures rely on a daily index calculated by averaging transaction prices at four bitcoin spot exchanges between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. London time. Anomalous trades are tossed out so they can\u2019t influence the calculation. So to bang the close at CME, you would need to do intense buying or selling at several of those bitcoin exchanges during the 60-minute window as the futures are expiring. That would be Jan. 26 for the first contract CME plans to list. CME says it is better to rely on four exchanges than one. \u201cWe are not beholden to any one price source,\u201d said Tim McCourt,  global head of equity products at CME. \u201cWe have multiple constituent exchanges, which all work together to enhance the integrity of the index.\u201d  So how likely is it that bitcoin futures will manipulated? "]
["Markets Main", "It\u2019s hard to say. The big unknown is that the bitcoin spot market is opaque, with vast swaths outside regulatory oversight. Consider this scenario: Cryptocurrency veterans say a small number of so-called whales hold many of the bitcoins in circulation, because they invested early, when bitcoin was cheap. Such an investor could short bitcoin futures, then dump their stash of bitcoins just before the futures expire, causing a world-wide price crash and profiting from their short trade, while also cashing in their years-old bitcoin investment. If they did the selling on overseas bitcoin exchanges instead of at Gemini or any of CME\u2019s partner exchanges, it would be tough for U.S. officials to catch them. On the other hand, the likely blowback from regulators, exchanges and cryptocurrency enthusiasts could discourage a whale from attempting something so brazen. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be intense scrutiny of these contracts,\u201d said Tom Lehrkinder,  an analyst at Tabb Group. \u201cBut people can always do crazy things.\u201d \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

American consumers used cash in 32% of all retail transactions in 2015, down from 40% in 2012, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent survey of payment choices. Cash accounted for just 9% of the value of payments by consumers in 2015, down from 14% in 2012. But it\u2019s one thing for consumers to choose to use less cash. It\u2019s another for governments to dramatically reduce its supply. Supporters say that would crimp criminal activity, among other benefits, because criminals rely so heavily on cash transactions."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "But others worry that the impact on people who depend on cash for legal activities would be too high a price. Kenneth S. Rogoff, the Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, argues in favor of scaling back the cash supply. James J. McAndrews,  an economist and fellow at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and former director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, says that would be a mistake.  By Kenneth S. Rogoff  It is high time for governments in the U.S. and other countries with advanced economies to accelerate the move that has long been under way toward a smaller role for cash. The payoff: reductions in crime and tax evasion, and greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy when necessary. Although there are a number of approaches the U.S. government could take, an obvious and relatively benign way to start would be to gradually phase out large-denomination notes, of say $50 and above, over a period of five to seven years, after a period of study and public comment. Let\u2019s look at where we are now. Currency use continues its long decline, thanks mainly to ever-improving alternatives including contactless payments and person-to-person payment networks such as Venmo. "]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "Yet there are three dozen $100 bills in circulation for every man, woman and child in the U.S. If you don\u2019t have three dozen, or any, you\u2019re not alone. Only a fraction of the known supply of paper currency can be accounted for in surveys of consumer and business holdings. So where is all that missing cash? Most of it is in the underground economy, where it fuels criminal activity and business that goes untaxed. In the underground economy, cash plays a big, well-established role for which there is no remotely perfect substitute in terms of liquidity and universal acceptance. That\u2019s why reducing the supply of cash, particularly large bills, would reduce crime and tax evasion. Without any $50 or $100 bills available, why wouldn\u2019t criminals and tax evaders simply switch to smaller bills? Consider this: $1 million in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds; the same amount in $20s would weigh 110 pounds, and take up a large suitcase instead of a small briefcase, making transport more difficult. Criminals and tax evaders also need to hide their cash. If you just have $100,000 to hide, the size of the bills hardly matters. But for wholesale crime and tax evasion\u2014which are rampant\u2014it is a big deal. The concern that an absence of large bills would compel organized crime to involve legitimate businesses in the use of false invoices and bogus checks to pay for criminal transactions is overblown. This might happen on a very small scale, but not to an extent that would come close to outweighing the larger beneficial effect on crime. "]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "Another advantage of eliminating large bills would be the effect on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve should be able to implement negative nominal interest rates vastly more effectively in the absence of large bills, which could prove quite important as a stimulative tool in the next financial crisis. The biggest obstacle to deeply negative interest rates is the concern that they would cause big institutional investors like insurers and pension funds to bail out of negative-rate Treasury bills and bonds and move that money into physical cash, to preserve its value. That cash hoarding would blunt the stimulative impact of the negative rates. Getting rid of $50s and $100s would discourage such hoarding, because transporting, storing and protecting cash is costly. In general, it will be easier for the Fed to take steps to stem a run into cash if it has already become marginalized in legal use. There are several problems with the alternative idea of raising the inflation target so that the resulting higher interest rates would give the Fed more room to lower rates in a crisis without going negative. Among the biggest: Ditching the Fed\u2019s longstanding commitment to low inflation would destabilize financial markets. Longer term, higher inflation would result in more frequent adjustment of prices and wages, lessening the impact of Fed policy throughout the cycle. Moreover, with the effects of cuts muted, the Fed would still quickly run out of ammunition in a crisis. And yes, inflated $100s would become more like smaller bills over time, but that would simply spark calls for printing larger denominations."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "The phasing out of large bills should have relatively little impact on the vast bulk of the population, who make little use of $100s. For those who rely on cash because they don\u2019t have bank accounts, efforts to bring them into the banking system would help. If countries ranging from Sweden to India can efficiently provide free debit accounts to low-income individuals, so too can the U.S. Abandoning cash entirely would be folly into the foreseeable future, for reasons of privacy, the need for cash in the wake of disasters like hurricanes, and the convenience of cash for small payments. But a society that uses far less cash is inevitable and desirable.  Dr. Rogoff is the Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy at Harvard University, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and co-author of \u201cThe Curse of Cash: How Large-Denomination Notes Aid Crime and Tax Evasion and Constrain Monetary Policy.\u201d He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.   By James J. McAndrews  The U.S. won\u2019t become mostly cashless anytime soon, and that is a good thing, because millions of Americans depend on cash to keep themselves afloat financially. As alternatives ranging from debit and credit cards to E-ZPass and others continue to grow in popularity, many consumers can lead a mostly cashless life if they so wish without facing too many inconveniences."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "Others aren\u2019t so lucky. According to the 2013 U.S. Survey of Consumer Finance, about 7.5% of American households don\u2019t have bank accounts. Cash is an important way for them to participate in the economy\u2014to receive wages and to buy goods from a variety of sellers. Until the U.S. has a financial system that serves these people, cash is vital. But what if we just phased out $50 and $100 bills? Would that harm these people? It would at least make life more difficult for them, and others. And, while it might help reduce certain types of crime and tax evasion because of the reliance of much criminal underground activity on large-denomination bills, It would fuel a different kind of crime: It would draw many legitimate businesses into criminal activity, because organized crime would forcibly involve them in noncash criminal transactions to get around the absence of large bills.  Surveys that reveal most people hold very little cash don\u2019t reflect the urgent demands for high-denomination bills that many people have on occasion. For example, people seeking medical procedures that they want to keep secret; the immigrant day laborer who sends cash to family in his home country; the wealthy suburban homeowner in Houston after Hurricane Harvey who seeks to assist neighbors and restore her property. These uses of high-denomination currency are extremely high-value to the individual and society. We would lose a lot if we eliminated the bills that can meet these urgent, and sometimes desperate, needs. Then there are the everyday uses of large bills. Day laborers, for instance, are paid in cash and pay their rent the same way."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", " Legitimate businesses, meanwhile, would be put at risk. Here\u2019s how: Imagine a thief has stolen a valuable collection of art and has arranged to sell it to the mafia. Today, the mob could pay the thief in $100 bills and there would be no record of the transaction. But in the absence of large bills, the mob needs another payment option that still obscures its involvement, and one way to do that is to draw in a third party through the use of fraudulent invoices.  The mob would force a legitimate business to write a check to the thief, disguised as a payment for an invoice from a nonexistent company for services that were never actually rendered. The legitimate business wouldn\u2019t lose that money\u2014the mob would deposit that amount in the business\u2019s account, disguised as a payment for goods or services. But the business would be guilty of criminal activity that could ultimately destroy it. The mob can force companies to do this by threatening violence, or by threatening to expose a company\u2019s noncompliance with zoning laws or employment of undocumented workers. There are other ways for the mafia to deal with an absence of large bills, but I believe this scenario would be common. There is a way to achieve the results promised by phasing out large bills\u2014disrupting criminal activity and giving the Fed more leeway in its interest-rate policy\u2014without also abruptly disrupting legitimate economic activity and creating unwilling new criminals: Raise the inflation target."]
["Journal Reports: Leadership", "A higher inflation target would be followed, over time, by a higher inflation rate, which would be accompanied by higher nominal interest rates. That would give the Fed more room to cut interest rates without having to resort to negative nominal rates, removing the danger of negative rates causing a widespread run to cash. A higher inflation rate also would mean the real values of $50 and $100 bills would decline more quickly\u2014meaning criminal activity would be disrupted by the need to transport, store and exchange many more bills. Of course, this also would impose that same inconvenience on the legitimate uses of large bills. But while a higher inflation rate would accelerate the need for more bills to complete transactions, that would still happen over a much longer time frame than the phaseout of large bills envisioned in this discussion, giving people much more time to adjust. Whether we achieve a mostly cashless society sooner or later should be left to technological advancement. As all the uses of cash can be met in better ways, people will adopt those alternatives over time; to rush adoption of inferior alternatives would be a mistake.

Last week,\n            Exxon Mobil\n Corp.\nreported its best quarter since 2015.\n            Chevron\n Corp.\n      posted a profit of $2.7 billion, after reporting a loss for 2016 and France\u2019s\n            Total\n SA\nsaid its profit surged 77% in the first three months of 2017.\n        Royal Dutch Shell\n          \n      PLC is due to report later this week.

The results were some of the company\u2019s strongest since it announced a massive $20 billion deal to settle outstanding claims relating to its Gulf of Mexico blowout.  The company\u2019s share price jumped 2.4% in early London trading as investors reacted positively to the results. "]
["Business", "The pretax bill for the 2010 disaster that killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the sea has reached nearly $63 billion, BP said.  The payments relating to the spill are expected to total between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2017, before falling to around $2 billion in 2018.  The company reported robust operating cash flow in the first quarter, which is expected to continue to improve. Excluding payments related to the oil spill, the company\u2019s cash flow from operations improved to $4.4 billion in the first quarter, helping it maintain a dividend of 10 cents a share.  This will reassure investors, who received a jolt in February when the company said it needed oil prices to rise to $60 a barrel to break even. That number is expected to drift closer to $55 a barrel in 2017. Cash flow is also seen strengthening as part of BP\u2019s plan to bring on seven new projects this year. The company sees oil trading at $50-$55 a barrel in 2017, likely capped by stronger shale production in the U.S., Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said, despite efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb output and boost prices.

Mr. Zhao said Beijing may have allowed the August coal shipments to get ahead of further economic sanctions that it fears could destabilize the Pyongyang government. \u201cChina may have decided to back away from an aggressive enforcement of sanctions, and apply a degree of pressure closer to the minimum requirements stipulated by U.N. resolutions,\u201d Mr. Zhao said, noting that Beijing\u2019s February suspension of its North Korean coal trade came while import totals remained well below the U.N. cap. \u201cAs international sanctions against North Korea trend toward a comprehensive trade ban, China was likely worried about the impact on the North Korean economy,\u201d he said. \u2014Xiao Xiao contributed to this article."]

Last month I attended a family wedding in a city better known for its frigid winter winds and industrial history than for its natural beauty. Let\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t a destination wedding. Still, the young couple and their families were over the moon with joy, as were the hundreds who attended.  In an era when the number of unmarried couples living together continues to rise, up by nearly 30% in the U.S. in the last decade alone, why make a big fuss over marriage? One could say that by tying the knot, the 20-somethings were fulfilling religious and family traditions, making a public declaration of their love or expressing a vote of confidence in the future. A new study also suggests a more practical motive: Getting married is one of the best ways to cement a couple\u2019s long-term happiness."]
["Mind & Matter", "Published in December in the Journal of Happiness Studies, the study analyzed people\u2019s responses to two huge British surveys about life satisfaction. The study\u2019s authors\u2014John Helliwell,  an economist at the University of British Columbia, and his former graduate student, Shawn Grover\u2014hoped to answer two questions: Is marriage\u2019s effect on happiness short-lived? And does marriage cause happiness, or is it that happy people are more likely to get and stay married in the first place? To isolate these different variables, the researchers turned first to a longitudinal survey project by a British institute. From 1991 to 2009, demographers asked 30,000 adults of varying ages about their lifestyles and moods, posing the same questions year after year. This allowed the Helliwell research team to see how happy people were long before\u2014as well as a decade after\u2014they met their partners, and also to assess how their levels of happiness changed over the long run. Whether they ultimately married, divorced, stayed single or were living together, the researchers thus had a snapshot in hand of their pre-relationship sense of fulfillment. This is crucial, because happiness is U-shaped across the adult life-span, meaning that it normally rises when we\u2019re young adults, drops during middle age when life\u2019s stresses and existential questions loom large, and then rises again as older adults regain their equilibrium. To bolster their findings, the researchers also used a second survey, 10 times as large as the first and based on U.K. census data. This Annual Population Survey by the national statistics office queried more than 300,000 people from 2011 to 2013 about their anxieties, social lives and happiness."]
["Mind & Matter", "\n The researchers\u2019 answer to their first question\u2014whether marriage had a merely short-lived effect on happiness\u2014was definitively no. When they controlled for their pre-marriage status, married people were 10% more satisfied than people who were single\u2014and were more likely to stay that way. While cohabiting couples were happier than single folks, they were only three-quarters as happy as marrieds. \u201cMarriage seems to be most important in middle age, when people of every marital status experience a dip in well-being,\u201d the economists wrote.  Not all marriages are created equal, of course. At least a dozen studies show that marriages characterized by stonewalling, contempt or conflict are bad for us, undermining our sleep, immunity and cardiovascular health. Conversely, one of the most telling findings of the Helliwell study is that a close marital bond spurs long-term happiness. People who named their spouse as their best friend were twice as happy as those who didn\u2019t. \u201cThe more likely you are to regard someone as your friend, the more likely you\u2019ll think the best of them, and not take them for granted. If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s a very successful marriage,\u201d Prof. Helliwell said. It\u2019s good to know that someone has your back. That level of commitment, formalized by a ritual and a legal document, may be one reason why the advantages of marriage trump those of just living together. Along with chocolate, it\u2019s all food for thought as we approach Valentine\u2019s Day."]

["Technology", "Such in-house brands tend to be lucrative for both their manufacturers and retailers, in part due to savings on brand development and marketing. By creating its own products, Amazon may be able to design packaging to reduce shipping costs, as well as better control profit margins. Store brands reached $118.4 billion in U.S. sales last year, up about $2.2 billion from the prior year, data from the Private Label Manufacturers Association show. An Amazon spokeswoman said she had no comment.  Amazon seems to be hoping to establish its brands as something other than just discount alternatives to\u00a0mass-market competitors. Bags of 12-ounce Happy Belly coffee cost $9.99 each, about $2 more than Starbucks\u2019s breakfast blend, but about $3 less than Starbucks\u2019s French roast in a similar size. And it is less expensive than some small-batch roasters. Amazon\u2019s apple blueberry organic baby food costs $12.49 for a dozen 4-ounce jars. That compares with $12 for a variety 12-pack of Earth\u2019s Best brand organic baby food \u00a0from Hain Celestial Group Inc.  Amazon has taken pains to disguise the provenance of its new private labels. Neither of its product description pages identify Amazon, and a customer service phone number is for AFS Brands Inc. in Seattle. A representative there said the acronym stands for Amazon Fulfillment Services. Still, the baby food comes with \u201cno surprises,\u201d Amazon advertises on its site, and is \u201cgrown without potentially harmful pesticides or chemical fertilizers.\u201d Happy Belly coffee, meanwhile, is \u201cgrown by small-scale farmers\u201d and is \u201csustainably sourced.\u201d"]

China has responded in kind, threatening tariffs on $50 billion of key American exports like soybeans and airplanes. Is a full-scale trade war now inevitable? Not exactly\u2014but the odds have risen sharply. A cool $50 billion in and of itself isn\u2019t much to worry about from China\u2019s perspective: It would only knock 2018 growth off around 0.1%, say most economists. But if ongoing negotiations fail and these tariffs become a reality, the long-term impact will likely be far more damaging.  Foreign firms in China are among the most productive of all firms there and are a critical conduit into the country for technology. "]
["Heard on the Street", "Those same companies will dial back investment if they believe routing Chinese goods into the U.S. is set to become progressively difficult. And China\u2014struggling under a massive debt load created by its own inefficient state firms\u2014needs their dynamism and know-how. China would ride out a trade spat well in the short term: Nearly half the workforce is now in services, while trade-exposed industry\u2019s share has declined.  But companies attracting investment from outside mainland China have still been key job engines over the long run. Crucially, they have done so without the dangerous build-up of debt that\u2019s characterized so much of China\u2019s domestic industry.  Firms with investment from both abroad and greater China delivered 10% of all urban job growth from end 2007 to 2016, using just 5.5% of total investment. In the industrial sector, where foreign investment is concentrated, return on assets clocked in at nearly 9% last year for such firms\u2014against 7% for all firms and a dismal 4% for state-owned companies.

Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters If China is going to escape its debt trap\u2014itself largely a state-owned construction\u2014it needs those numbers to go higher, not lower. Skittish foreign firms eyeing the exits will make that harder. And if trade really takes a dive, Beijing could be forced into another round of unproductive debt-fueled stimulus."]
["Heard on the Street", "So while U.S. leverage with China is weaker than a decade ago, there are still good reasons for China to offer concessions. Neither the U.S. or China has yet set a firm deadline for these tariffs to actually take effect\u2014that means the next step is serious horse trading. The question is what the Trump administration will accept. A few things are perhaps achievable. They include greater purchases of U.S. semiconductors by Beijing\u2014a move reportedly under discussion; much looser joint venture or foreign ownership requirements, particularly in sectors like finance and health care where additional capital is sorely needed; and higher Chinese payments for U.S. intellectual property.  A rapid $100 billion fall in the bilateral deficit, however, is not attainable\u2014without a real and very damaging trade war.

The...\n WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a federal rule that calls for payments to businesses, schools and other large energy consumers that reduce their electricity usage at times of peak demand. The court\u2019s 6-2 ruling was a win for environmentalists and others that promote energy efficiency and conservation, including a growing cottage industry of firms helping companies cut energy costs.  The decision was a blow for power generators and utilities that had accused a federal energy regulator of unlawfully distorting energy markets and suppressing demand for the electricity they sell. Shares of big power sellers including\n            NRG Energy\n Inc.,\nDynegy\n Inc.\n      and\n        Calpine\n Corp.\n      fell sharply on the ruling, though some power suppliers said the decision wasn\u2019t all bad."]
["Law", "The high court, in an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan,  said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acted lawfully in a 2011 order requiring wholesale electricity market operators to pay higher levels of compensation to power customers that agreed to reduce their electricity use.  The court\u2019s majority sided firmly with the commission on both central legal questions in the case, a development that came as a something of a surprise. When the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in October, conservative justices voiced skepticism about the FERC\u2019s efforts. On Monday two conservatives\u2014Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2014joined with the court\u2019s four liberal justices in ruling for the commission. The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling from 2014 that invalidated the FERC order. FERC said its rule provided fairness in wholesale electricity markets and reduced the prospect of blackouts and brownouts when the nation\u2019s power grid becomes strained. It also said the rule produced billions of dollars in consumer benefits by reducing wholesale electricity costs that consumers bear.  Jon Wellinghoff,  a former FERC chairman who led the commission when it issued the rule, said the decision makes energy-control technology more valuable \u201cand allows you to use it, not only to reduce your own costs but to get additional value by selling your services to a larger market or allowing someone else to sell it for you.\u201d At times of peak demand, it is costly for electricity generators to increase supply, so wholesale market operators sometimes pay large energy consumers such as factories, big-box stores, hospitals and schools to cut their use instead."]
["Law", "Under the FERC rule, organized energy markets such as PJM Interconnection, which serves 13 Eastern and Midwestern states, are required to let consumers reduce their energy demand in exchange for payments comparable to what power generators would have received to provide similar power. A key legal question in the case stemmed from the dual nature of electricity regulation. FERC regulates at the wholesale level, while the states regulate retail electricity markets. Industry challengers argued FERC\u2019s rule intruded on the domain of the states because the commission was targeting retail electricity use, even if the rule itself applied only on wholesale markets. Justice Kagan, writing for the court\u2019s majority, rejected that argument. She said FERC rules invariably will have some effect on retail electricity markets, but that didn\u2019t make them unlawful. \u201cFERC set the terms of transactions occurring in the organized wholesale markets, so as to ensure the reasonableness of wholesale prices and the reliability of the interstate grid\u2014just as the [Federal Power Act] contemplates,\u201d Justice Kagan wrote. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented, saying they believed FERC\u2019s efforts wrongly focused on retail-level energy consumption. The White House, which considers the rule an important factor in helping address climate change, welcomed the decision. Spokesman Frank Benenati said the ruling \u201callows us to continue realizing billions in annual savings from innovative incentives and business models that ensure we use our electricity system efficiently.\u201d  John Shelk,  president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, declined to comment."]
["Law", "Even though shares of several power suppliers dropped on Monday\u2019s ruling, some said the decision came with a silver lining. Dynegy Chief Executive Bob Flexon said he would rather have market rules set by FERC than by 50 states. He added that markets under FERC oversight recently have taken steps to make sure organizations offering to cut energy use actually live up to their commitments\u2014something that has been a problem in the past.  NRG Energy said it felt the court decision was fair. The New Jersey company both sells electricity from its large fleet of generating plants and offers energy management services to big users. One big winner Monday was\n        EnerNOC\n Inc.,\n      which provides energy management and conservation services. It shot up close to 70% on the decision.   Tim Healy,  the company\u2019s chief executive, said the court decision \u201clifts a big cloud that has kept people from investing in this industry.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito was recused in the case.

Last year, Adidas introduced apparel and high-end sneakers designed by Mr. West in limited quantities, notably $350 gray suede high-tops called the Yeezy Boost 750 that have been selling for thousands of dollars on the secondary market.  The company declined to provide sales figures for the Yeezys, though Adidas\u2019s share of the more than $1 billion secondary market jumped from 1% to 30% since the shoes were introduced in February 2015, according to market tracker StockX, formerly known as Campless. It is unclear how well Mr. West\u2019s fashion brand will translate to athletes looking for performance footwear. In an interview, Mr. West said he hopes to get his sneakers on the feet of players for the National Basketball Association and the National Football League, though Adidas added no such plans are in place yet. \u201cOur industry is so ready for disruption, the same signature lines have X player, Y player, Z player, so of course we\u2019re going to have Kanye work with our guys to challenge that as well,\u201d said Eric Liedtke,  chief marketing officer for Adidas. Mr. West said he played football, basketball, tennis and volleyball in high school, but that singing and performing are also athletic. "]

There was an NBA Jam console. There was a pop-a-shot machine. There was even a pop-up barbershop.  More than 3,000 people attended the show. But one stood out, partly because he was 7-foot tall, and mostly because he plays for the Warriors.  Golden State center JaVale McGee was hard to miss.

["Streetwise", "The news recently highlights plenty of trouble: North Korean nukes, American neo-Nazis, corporate leaders abandoning the White House, and a president threatening to shut down his own government if he doesn\u2019t get his way. Yet markets have treated it all with a weary skepticism, with the S&P 500 just 1.5% off its high hit two weeks ago. The only threat being treated seriously is the U.S. debt ceiling, and that\u2019s almost certainly overdone. In some ways this makes sense. Risk is a combination of probability and impact, and while nuclear war would have the ultimate impact, it will need more than a few comments by shouty leaders to make such a self-destructive outcome seem likely. History offers many examples of Korean saber-rattling since the 1953 armistice, and none led to renewed war, so investors may have simply learned to ignore them. The debt ceiling is a different matter. The U.S. came perilously close to defaulting on its debt in 2011, leading Standard & Poor\u2019s to take away the country\u2019s top credit rating. Already traders are starting to price in the danger of a repeat in early October, when the Treasury can do no more to avoid the ceiling. Treasury bills maturing in early October yield 0.2 percentage points more than those due in early November, a very large kink in what is usually a smoothly rising yield. The current anomaly is far higher than at a similar point ahead of the debt ceiling votes in 2011, 2013 and 2015, according to Jordan Rochester, Nomura FX strategist."]
["Streetwise", "The lesson of recent years was that some in Congress were prepared to flirt with default on U.S. debt unless they got their way on spending cuts. The proximity of the budget approval vote\u2014which faces a decent chance of turning into a government shutdown\u2014to the debt ceiling raises the risk that they become entangled, and party politics prevents the ceiling being raised. Yet, congressional leaders understand the serious impact on markets and the economy if the U.S. were to default; in the 2011 debt ceiling panic the S&P 500 fell 17% in two weeks. John East, a political consultant at ACG Analytics in Washington, says a default will be avoided and the real question is what, if anything,Democrats will extract in return\u2014perhaps continued health care insurance subsidies for children. \u201cA hard deadline focuses people\u2019s attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [Congress] will sweep in at the last second to avert catastrophe.\u201d The early signs suggest traders think the chance of trouble is higher this year, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. Many high-profile investors have warned of the dangers posed by a capricious president, with Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio this week warning (again) that politics meant the U.S. was headed for 1937-style postcrisis problems. When politics goes wrong, bad things can happen."]
["Streetwise", "I still find it hard to believe that the U.S. will default. Even if there was a default, it should make sense to buy the higher-yielding October bill instead of the November bill; either the U.S. will quickly resume payments, in which case the two are basically the same, or it won\u2019t, in which case the November payment will also be missed.The extra money on offer from bills so far is too small to make much difference to investors operating without large amounts of leverage, but politics does throw up bigger opportunities. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Congress the U.S. debt ceiling needed to be raised by Sept. 29, or the government risked running out of money to pay its bills. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib examines how hard it will be for the government to meet that deadline. Photo: Getty Philip Saunders, a fund manager at Investec Asset Management, grabbed one of these when Mexican shares and bonds were dumped following Donald Trump\u2019s election. Buying Mexico was, he said, \u201cthe purest play on political overreaction.\u201d That trade worked out as Mr. Trump retreated from threats to make Mexico pay for a wall, and a contrarian approach to politics can work.  Rupert Harrison,  a BlackRock fund manager who was previously chief of staff to the British chancellor, says it is possible to exploit the tendency of investors to overreact to political risk, while also watching for risks that are being ignored."]
["Streetwise", "\u201cFor the last year it has paid to focus on fundamentals and to own political risk,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially you\u2019re trading the market\u2019s systematic tendency to run away from what it doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d  Investors who put money on the policies of Mr. Trump at the end of last year have been sorely disappointed this year, as bets on tax cuts and trade restrictions unwound. A plausible case can be made now that Republicans will agree on tax cuts next year in order to have something to campaign on in the mid-terms, but with every presidential tweet it\u2019s becoming harder to believe\u2014and the trades haven\u2019t been rewarded.

It reflects a growing emphasis on what educators call personalized learning\u2014tailoring students\u2019 work to their individual needs and interests, and pressing them to take responsibility for mastering agreed-upon skills. The aim is to spawn lifelong learners who can adapt nimbly to change. The format can be jarring at first for parents. \u201cThe first time you do it, it\u2019s a little disconcerting.

But after participating in student-led conferences starting in elementary school for her son Andy, who is now 16, Ms. Simek says she was pleased to see how proud he was of his work with other students on group projects. Letting students lead \u201cgives your child a chance to show you the personality they have at school, and who they are when they\u2019re away from you,\u201d she says."]
["Work & Family", "Some schools have students attend all parent-teacher conferences. Others allow teachers to decide whether students are present. Students often lead, but sometimes just take part. Principals at public schools in Arlington, Va., began embracing student-led conferences about five years ago, starting in fourth or fifth grade, a school district spokeswoman says. About half of the district\u2019s 28 elementary and middle schools now have students take the lead. Some private schools have included middle- and high-school students in parent-teacher conferences, but many are extending the practice to lower grades. Teachers begin preparing for these sessions weeks in advance. They help students set learning goals, make plans to reach them and understand what their work will look like after they\u2019ve succeeded, says Kara Vandas,  a Castle Rock, Colo., professional-development consultant to schools and co-author with Mary Jane O\u2019Connell of a 2015 book on student-led learning. Students also collect samples of their drafts and finished work in notebooks, digital files, portfolios or posters to show their parents.  Tanya Marchman-Twete,  a fifth-grade teacher at Lone Tree Elementary School in Lone Tree, Colo., says more parents attend student-led conferences because their children get excited about leading the conferences. And students sometimes think more deeply about problems when they describe them with both their teacher and their parents present, she says. When one fifth-grader complained about conflicts he was having with other students, he had a eureka moment. The student realized he was fueling the tensions by always insisting on doing things his own way in games."]
["Work & Family", " Kelli Lumaye says she had a similar epiphany when her 11-year-old daughter Eliza declared herself \u201cbad in math\u201d during a student-led conference two years ago. Eliza was more anxious about math than she had realized, she says. Both she and Ms. Marchman-Twete reassured Eliza that many students have similar problems and she wasn\u2019t as far behind as she feared, Ms. Lumaye says. They agreed on some exercises Eliza could do with Ms. Lumaye\u2019s help at home. She has since gained confidence. Many teachers see traditional conferences with parents as stressful, tiring and time-consuming, research shows. Anxious parents closely monitor every word the teacher says and try to show they\u2019re good parents by criticizing their child before the teacher does, says Danielle Pillet-Shore,  an associate professor of communication at the University of New Hampshire, who has analyzed videos of the conversations.  A student\u2019s presence \u201cchanges the dynamic tremendously,\u201d Dr. Pillet-Shore says, shifting the focus away from the parent. Parents can help by focusing on what the student is learning, rather than grades, and praising the student\u2019s effort. Most important, experts say, is for parents to ask, \u201cWhat can I do to help you meet your goals?\u201d The Park children of Tiburon, Calif., have led parent-teacher conferences at their school.

["Work & Family", "Student-led conferences can go awry if parents focus on disappointing grades, join the teacher in criticizing the student and demand to know why he or she isn\u2019t doing better, says Ms. O\u2019Connell, a Sedalia, Colo., professional-development consultant. This can leave a student feeling deflated and wanting nothing more than to get everyone off his back, she says.  Kyle Redford,  who teaches fifth grade at Marin Country Day School in Corte Madera, Calif., says student-led conferences help ensure that parents and teachers are all getting the same story from the student. A student might pretend at school that he\u2019s managing his work just fine, then have an emotional meltdown about it at home.

Ms. Kohen on Tuesday also said the bonuses at issue were really retention payments to company insiders that are prohibited under bankruptcy law."]
["Pro Bankruptcy Bankruptcy", "Amendments to the bankruptcy code in 2005 barred companies from paying so-called retention bonuses to insiders. Instead companies can only pay incentive bonuses\u2014-tied to financial goals\u2014to its highest ranking executives. The change had come in response to the outcry that top executives were reaping so-called pay-to-stay bonuses while rank-and-file employees and retirees suffered. However, following testimony from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us financial advisers regarding the financial thresholds and the need to keep executives in place to achieve a successful reorganization, Judge Phillips sided with the company on the matter. \u201cI understand the U.S. trustee\u2019s job is to be the federal watchdog, and you very well performed that responsibility,\u201d Judge Phillips said Tuesday. \u201cHowever, I believe the preponderance of evidence\u2026establishes the plan is to incentivize and not retain.\u201d Last month Toys \u201cR\u201d Us proposed these bonus payments to its top tier executives, including Chief Executive David Brandon,  based on achieving specific financial metric. While the company initially proposed paying between $16 million and $32 million to the executives, it ended up lowering the amounts following negotiations with unsecured creditors. In court papers filed late last week, a lawyer for the retailer\u2019s unsecured creditors said the group supported the bonus payments after the retailer tweaked financial metrics and decreased overall payments. The bonus plan also received the support of other creditor and lender groups, according to court papers. Judge Phillips said that support from creditors for the bonus program was persuasive."]
["Pro Bankruptcy Bankruptcy", "\u201cI see the committee and any creditors who\u2019ve addressed this court are asking the court to approve this plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s telling.\u201d The judge also approved a plan to pay non-insiders up to $68 million in bonuses if certain financial thresholds are met. The payments are earmarked for 3,805 employees. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us employs a total 64,000 workers, court papers show. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us sought bankruptcy protection in September after vendors tightened terms and demanded cash on delivery for shipments. Since then, the company has smoothed its troubles with vendors and returned to normal terms ahead of the holiday season. As the company works through this holiday season, it is looking ahead to next year. During Tuesday\u2019s hearing, the retailer\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Sussberg of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, said Toys \u201cR\u201d Us hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection before the 2018 holiday season.

Labor Department...\n The Labor Department cleared a landmark retirement-savings rule to take effect next month, ending a stretch of uncertainty for brokers and investors after President Donald Trump called for a review of the Obama-era regulation with an eye toward repeal or revision.  The so-called fiduciary rule\u2014which aims to eliminate conflicts in financial advice and ensure that brokers put the interests of retirement savers first\u2014was originally due to come online in April but was delayed for 60 days as part of the review. Labor Department Secretary Alexander Acosta surprised many across the brokerage and insurance industries by recommending, in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece late Monday, against a further delay in the rule. "]
["Markets Main", "While Mr. Acosta preserved the possibility of revision or repeal of the rule as the Labor Department continues its economic review, the decision to let the regulation come into effect June 9 effectively makes it harder to reverse later. This is because firms across the country have to communicate compliance changes to clients, including disclosures about how clients are charged and commitments to put customers\u2019 interests first. \u201cThis puts us into an embarrassing predicament if this goes away,\u201d said Mark Cresap of Cresap Inc., a small brokerage firm in Radnor, Pa., who said he has had been waiting for resolution to the rule\u2019s fate before distributing client disclosures that are written and ready to go. The outcome reflects the difficulty in quickly carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to roll back financial rules, despite optimism on Wall Street that followed his election. Legislative changes will be difficult to win amid partisan changes on Capitol Hill. And while the administration is conducting a broad review of financial rules, changes have been slower to materialize at regulatory agencies that have to jump through legal hoops before they can rewrite the rulebook. The so-called fiduciary rule, six years in the making and unveiled by the Labor Department last spring, holds brokers and advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings to a fiduciary standard as opposed to the previous suitability standard. That means they must work in the best interest of their clients and generally avoid conflicts, which can come about with the commission-based compensation common among brokers and insurance agents."]
["Markets Main", "In pushing for the rule, the Obama administration said conflicted financial advice costs American families $17 billion a year and drags down annual returns on retirement savings by a percentage point. Opponents, including many financial-industry leaders, have said those figures are inflated and have contended that the rule would punish smaller savers in the form of less access to financial advice and heftier fees for those who trade infrequently. The rule stands to affect about $3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S., according to research firm\n            Morningstar\n Inc.\n Although it is a longer shot now, the Labor Department\u2019s review of the fiduciary rule could still result in significant revisions or even determine that a repeal is in order. In a memo to the department shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump specifically asked for an evaluation of the regulation\u2019s effects on consumer choice, potential industry disruption and increased litigation. In his opinion piece, Mr. Acosta said the Trump administration remains committed to reversing \u201cunnecessary regulations\u201d that eliminate jobs or impose costs that exceed their benefits. \u201cThe Fiduciary Rule as written may not align with President Trump\u2019s deregulatory goals,\u201d he wrote. Still, Mr. Acosta\u2019s decision against further delaying the regulation\u2019s applicability date is a setback for critics in the financial-services industry."]
["Markets Main", "\u201cWe are disappointed that a delay was not issued,\u201d said Neil Bradley, senior vice president and chief policy officer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber, which has led legal challenges against the Labor Department over the fiduciary rule, said it would \u201ccontinue to pursue all available options and work with the Labor Department, the SEC, and Congress to develop a fix.\u201d The rule now takes partial effect on June 9. Brokers and insurance agents don\u2019t need to comply with certain parts of the regulation until Jan. 1, 2018.  Erin Sweeney, an attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who represents companies in litigation regarding fiduciary obligations, says she believes it is going to be difficult to roll back the rule but not wholly impossible. \u201cI think there is a chance for the opponents\u201d still hoping for reprieve, Ms. Sweeney said, \u201cbut the window is closing quite rapidly.\u201d At this point, she said, the Labor Department appears to be more focused on helping firms comply with the regulation than with changing it.  To that end, the department said it is seeking feedback about impediments to implementation and whether an additional extension of the Jan. 1 deadline for full compliance is appropriate. Experts say any potential changes the Labor Department pursues are likely to be around elements of the regulation that don\u2019t become applicable until later, such as around certain disclosure requirements and the required contracts between brokers and their clients. It is easier to reverse parts of the rule that don\u2019t kick in next month, said Andrew Oringer, a partner at Dechert LLP who leads the New York law firm\u2019s fiduciary practice, though he said the value of any potential changes to the financial industry diminish once June 9 arrives."]
["Markets Main", "Overturning the regulation has proved harder than some opponents anticipated. The rule\u2019s resilience is in part owed to the Obama administration\u2019s approach that included six years of economic analysis, days of public hearings and over 100 meetings. Courts across the country have upheld the department\u2019s authority and shut down challenges to the rule\u2019s scope. Moreover, said Ms. Sweeney, the regulation saves investors $147 million every 60 days, according to the Obama administration\u2019s analysis. \u201cGiven the incredible dollars involved,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be a heavy lift\u201d and require something to come out of the new economic review that changes the calculus. \u2014Ryan Tracy contributed to this article  Write to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Phillies are a mess. The Flyers can\u2019t make it past the first round of the playoffs. The Eagles are on their third head coach in five seasons. And the 76ers have spent the past few years making a concerted effort to be as miserable as possible. All that losing would have been tough to take anywhere, but it was especially brutal for Philadelphia\u2019s famously cantankerous fans. These are the supporters who have booed hometown heroes from Ryan Howard to Donovan McNabb, chased dozens of coaches and general managers out of town and, back when civility was a thing in sports, once threw snowballs at Santa Claus."]
["NFL", "But the most bizarre twist in Philadelphia\u2019s soul-crushing sports ineptitude is what\u2019s happening right now with the Eagles. They are 2-0 with a first-time head coach and a rookie quarterback from North Dakota who never played major college football. And the hardened fans in this city are positively giddy.  \n \u201cThe miracle has arrived,\u201d Angelo Cataldi, who has hosted a morning radio show since 1990, said of the city\u2019s response to rookie quarterback Carson Wentz. \u201cOur prayers have been answered.\u201d Those prayers, as it turns out, were victories over the Cleveland Browns and Chicago Bears, who may very well turn out to be the two worst teams in the NFL this season. But Wentz\u2019s performances as a rookie in those games\u2014468 passing yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions\u2014have been enough to convince Philadelphians that the dark days here may be over soon.  The infatuation with Wentz isn\u2019t merely a product of his play, either. In this city, where the fictional movie character Rocky is synonymous with an athlete\u2019s improbable climb to success, there are few better pairings than a quarterback who played his college football at North Dakota State and a coach, Doug Pederson, who coached high-school football for four years after a career as a backup quarterback in the NFL. In contrast with former coach Chip Kelly, an aloof taskmaster who had promised to transform the team with a groundbreaking offense and revolutionary embrace of science but was ultimately fired after less than three seasons, Pederson has given Eagles fans a reason to feel re-connected to the team. "]
["NFL", "\u201cPhilly wants blue collar,\u201d said Lou Vogel, a technology sales manager from Haddon Heights, New Jersey who drives a green school bus plastered with Eagles logos to every game. \u201c(Kelly) wasn\u2019t blue collar. Pederson is.\u201d Philadelphia Eagles fans hold up a sign during the second half of Monday night\u2019s win over the Chicago Bears.Photo: Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Of course, these same fans were seduced by Kelly once, too. While his no-huddle offense was piling up yards and wins for most of the first two years of his tenure, Eagles fans crowed about their mastermind coach and his brilliant system. It wasn\u2019t until he traded for injury-prone quarterback Sam Bradford that they started to wonder if he\u2019d outsmarted himself. All of which helps to explain why Wentz is such a source of optimism. It\u2019s not merely the fact that he inherited the starting job despite missing most of the NFL preseason. Or that he\u2019s looked preternaturally cool and composed as a rookie. Or that he has made advanced audibles at the line of scrimmage before flashing a powerful, accurate arm. It\u2019s all that and what came before his first start. Wentz\u2019s ascension to the starting role helped clear the way for the Eagles to trade Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings on the eve of the new season, ushering a symbol of the Kelly era out the door and furnishing the team with a first-round pick in next year\u2019s draft\u2014which just so happens to be in Philadelphia. "]
["NFL", "To be sure, Eagles fans know better than most that Wentz\u2019s early success is no guarantee of a distinguished career. Nick Foles was the toast of the town when he threw for 27 touchdowns and two interceptions in 2013, but he flamed out the next season. Kevin Kolb and Bobby Hoying once seemed like potential franchise quarterbacks, too, before ending up on the scrapheap. Even McNabb, who led the Eagles to one Super Bowl appearance and five NFC Championships and is considered the greatest quarterback in franchise history, is often disparaged by fans for failing to win a Lombardi Trophy. But after 120 minutes of football against a couple of sub-par opponents, Eagles fans seem oddly optimistic that Wentz can become the quarterback to lead the team to its first Super Bowl title. \u201cWe have always, as Eagles fans, been like, \u2018Why can\u2019t we get somebody like that?\u2019\u201dsaid Marc Rose, a fan from West Chester, Pennsylvania who works in finance who estimates he has missed fewer than 10 home games in the last 45 years. \u201c\u2018Why can\u2019t we get a Joe Flacco?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s not only diehard Eagles fans who are cuckoo over Wentz\u2019s performances. Eagles left tackle Jason Peters, who has seen his share of quarterback play in 13 seasons in the NFL, compared Wentz to Packers star Aaron Rodgers. Super Bowl winner Jon Gruden, now an ESPN announcer, said he wished he\u2019d coached Wentz, whom he described as \u201ca monster.\u201d The excitement has even reached the highest corridors of power: Barack Obama told a crowd in Philadelphia that Joe Biden urged him to hop on the \u201cWentz Wagon.\u201d"]
["NFL", "The frenzy over Wentz\u2019 success has brightened the outlook on Philadelphia\u2019s other losers. Cataldi, the radio host, has noticed a streak of optimism among callers who are used to venting about the rebuilding Sixers and Phillies. Some fans see the Wentz phenomenon as a model for the upcoming NBA season. The Sixers losing so much last season finally won them the No. 1 pick in the draft, which they used to select Ben Simmons. Why can\u2019t he be the next Wentz? \u201cIf you get the right person,\u201d said Zachary Lazev, a Sixers season ticket-holder of three years, \u201cyou can build a franchise around them.\u201d  \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report on immigration assesses the economic and fiscal impacts of immigration, offering a broad look at a phenomenon that has moved to the forefront of the presidential race, with both candidates debating the downsides and merits of immigration."]
["U.S. Economy", "The conclusion runs counter to a popular narrative suggesting that immigrants take the jobs of U.S. citizens, though it does acknowledge some costs for segments of the population. It highlights research showing an influx of lower-skilled workers can lead to lower wages for earlier waves of immigrants and native-born high-school dropouts. And the study found that immigration can burden government finances, especially education budgets at the state and local levels. The report, citing a lack of data, doesn\u2019t distinguish between the impacts of documented and undocumented immigrants. The distillation of research and previously unavailable data offer a big-picture view that highlights the overarching benefits of immigration without discounting the dislocation and the fiscal costs associated with illegal and legal arrivals into the U.S. People are sworn in during a special naturalization ceremony in honor of Citizenship Day and Constitution Day at Ellis Island in New York last week.Photo: Kena Betancur/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images \u201cImmigration enlarges the economy while leaving the native population slightly better off on average, but the greatest beneficiaries of immigration are the immigrants themselves as they avail themselves of opportunities not available to them in their home countries,\u201d the report said. Immigration also can lead to more innovation, entrepreneurship and technological change across the economy, the report found. About 53% of immigrants had at least some college, including 16% with a graduate education, as of 2012. While often left out of the debate on immigration, such workers can help lift overall living standards."]
["U.S. Economy", "\u201cThe prospects for long run economic growth in the United States would be considerably dimmed without the contributions of high-skilled immigrants,\u201d the report said. The study also found that \u201cover a long time horizon (75 years in our estimates),\u201d the fiscal impacts of immigrants \u201care generally positive at the federal level and negative at the state and local levels.\u201d Much of the focus on immigration follows a significant jump in the foreign-born population and worries about illegal entry into the U.S. The number of immigrants living in the country has risen to 42.3 million, or about 13% of the population in 2014, from 24.5 million, or 9% of the population in 1995. During the same period, the number of unauthorized immigrants roughly doubled, reaching 11.1 million in 2014, according to the study\u2019s findings. Since 2009, about 300,000 to 400,000 new unauthorized immigrants have arrived each year and about the same number have left. One complaint of the researchers is the lack of granular government survey data allowing them to separate the effects of legal and illegal immigrants. Thus, isn\u2019t definitively clear if one segment of the immigrant population is having a greater impact on the economy or government budgets. \u201cWith the existing data, it is possible to just get maybe the total number of unauthorized but not their impact in this area or that area,\u201d said Cornell University\u2019s Francine Blau,  who, along with the National Academy of Science\u2019s Christopher Mackie,  led the study. \u201cWe have specifically asked for more information on that.\u201d"]
["U.S. Economy", "The study, featuring more than 20 leading academics, is the first such broad look at immigration in nearly 20 years. Its timing coincides with a particularly heated discussion of the topic during the presidential race. Republican candidate Donald Trump has made construction of a wall along the Mexican border his signature issue. He also has said he would step up deportation of illegal immigrants \u201carrested for any crime whatsoever.\u201d Democrat Hillary Clinton is calling for an immigration overhaul that includes a pathway to citizenship for those already in the country.  In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Wednesday, 54% of respondents said immigration helps the U.S. more than it hurts, a number slightly lower than in July but markedly higher than in polling over the past decade. A decade ago, for instance, just a slight plurality of the nation, 45% to 42%, saw immigration as a net positive. The report doesn\u2019t delve into societal questions, such as the impact of a shift in the cultural or racial makeup of the U.S. It does encapsulate a range of research and data looking at benefits and costs of a population that has risen rapidly in recent decades. Not all members of the panel who prepared the report see immigration as benign or entirely beneficial. Harvard University\u2019s George Borjas, in a series of dissenting blog posts, estimates that the fiscal burdens of immigration cancel out other economic benefits for native born Americans. \u201cThe impact of immigration on the aggregate wealth of natives is, at best, a wash,\u201d Mr. Borjas said."]

But one central bank has been quietly balancing this act since late last year, buying fewer bonds without spooking investors: the Bank of Japan. On Thursday, Germany\u2019s 10-year bund yield hit 0.5% for the first time since the start of 2016 as investors continue to anticipate the winding down of the ECB\u2019s \u20ac60 billion ($68.3 billion) worth of monthly bond purchases. Central banks have been buying bonds to stimulate the economy and inflation. The BOJ does this by targeting where it wants government bond yields to be, rather than setting an amount of money it will spend every month, as the ECB and Bank of England do and U.S. Federal Reserve once did."]
["Credit Markets", "So, if the BOJ hits its target of a zero yield on 10-year government debt, it can adjust its buying without having to announce it. Likewise, the commitment to intervene if yields rise puts off anyone considering shorting Japanese bonds: nobody wants to go up against a buyer that can essentially print its own money. In the second quarter of 2017, the BOJ accumulated an average of \u00a513.5 trillion in assets compared with a quarterly average of \u00a522.8 trillion in 2016. That is less than at any time since the program began in the spring of 2013. Japanese government bond yields have gyrated by far less than their European and U.S. peers in the last nine months, and haven\u2019t joined in the recent selloff. That selloff was triggered last week when ECB President Mario Draghi noted a \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d economic recovery in the eurozone. \u201cDraghi is discovering that narratives contrary to the one you want to get across can take hold in the market,\u201d said Grant Lewis,  head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe. Minutes from the ECB\u2019s June meeting released Thursday showed policy makers weighing up whether to drop their bias toward further stimulus.  That followed the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting minutes Wednesday, where officials signaled they may be ready to start slowly shrinking their large portfolio of bonds and other assets in the next few months."]
["Credit Markets", "Germany\u2019s 10-year bund yields rose by 0.2 of a percentage point in five days, the largest jump since 2015\u2019s \u201cbund tantrum\u201d when investors dumped bonds as they also anticipated less stimulus. Bonds in advanced economies tend to move together, and yields on U.S. and British 10-year bonds rose by a similar amount through the week. But Japan\u2019s 10-year yields rose by just 0.02%. Yields rise as prices fall. The BOJ can keep its markets stable by setting a clear limit on what it will tolerate, analysts say. In early February, when 10-year yields rose as high as 0.15%, the central bank offered to buy an unlimited volume of bonds at a yield of 0.11%, pushing yields back down. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly been easier for (BOJ chief Haruhiko) Kuroda. He\u2019s stood up and said yields will be held at these levels. Try and beat me, I\u2019ve got infinite resources,\u201d Mr. Lewis added. \u201cThat\u2019s actually allowed them to start purchasing less.\u201d Some analysts even expect the BOJ to drop the \u00a580 trillion target for annual bond purchases. \u201cAbandoning this target would come at little cost to the policy path,\u201d said Freya Beamish,  chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThe yield curve target is doing all the work.\u201d Mr. Draghi has outlined the difficulty faced by any central bank looking to taper so-called quantitative easing. While the threat of deflation that the ECB\u2019s program was designed to counter has passed, \u201ca very substantial degree of monetary policy is still needed,\u201d in part to ensure that \u201coverall financing conditions continue to support that reflationary process,\u201d he said in late June."]
["Credit Markets", "To be sure, an ECB target wouldn\u2019t necessarily iron out the volatility. Bond yields in Europe have long been more dramatic than those in Japan, where growth and inflation have been sluggish for decades. The ECB also has a series of national government bond markets to deal with, rather than a single one. \u201cFor a long time Japanese inflation expectations have been extremely low,\u201d said Peter Chatwell,  head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International. \u201cSo the central bank is more able to adjust its monetary policy without an immediate jump higher in yields.\u201d \u2014Riva Gold contributed to this article.

["Business", "Whole Foods, which pioneered the specialty-grocery sector, has faced intensified competition over the past several years as traditional supermarket operators like\n            Kroger\n Co.\n      stock more natural and organic foods and niche rivals like\n            Sprouts Farmers Market\n Inc.\n      lure shoppers with lower average prices. Whole Foods has been working for more than two years to cut prices and repair its reputation for high prices, but tactics like more deals have yet to boost sales to the extent hoped. Some investors and analysts have pressured Whole Foods to lower prices more aggressively to improve its image, while others worry that doing so will erode its relatively high profit margins. Whole Foods in May announced plans for a new sister chain of stores called 365 by Whole Foods\u2014named after its store brand. The chain, to open next year, will offer lower prices and target younger shoppers. Over the summer, Whole Foods\u2019 image problems were exacerbated by accusations from New York City officials that it had mislabeled weights of freshly packaged foods like vegetable platters, leading to overcharging customers. Whole Foods apologized and said the mistakes, which involved nine of its 425 locations, were unintentional. But the company said the episode hurt sales nationwide."]
["Business", "For the three months ended July 5, Whole Foods sales at established stores rose 1.3%, the company\u2019s worst performance since the 2009 economic downturn. By comparison, Whole Foods\u2019 annual sales growth at such stores had averaged 8% for the past 15 years through fiscal 2014, which ended a year ago. Whole Foods is expected in November to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for fiscal 2015, which ended Sunday. Whole Foods said the layoffs announced on Monday will occur over the next two months, and that it expects many of those affected to find other jobs at the company, though those positions might not be of equal pay or status.

The plan will give more than four million illegal immigrants the chance to apply for work permits and a temporary reprieve from deportation.

The plan will give more than four million illegal immigrants the chance to apply for work permits and a temporary reprieve from deportation. People who have been in the U.S. for at least five years and are parents of citizens or legal permanent residents would be eligible to apply. The White House said nearly a million more could benefit through other new or expanded programs. The president also is narrowing the group of people who would be subject to deportation, in what the White House said was an effort to focus enforcement resources on gang members, serious criminals and those who crossed the border after Jan. 1, 2014."]
["Politics and Policy", "\u201cWhat I\u2019m describing is accountability\u2014a common-sense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019ll be deported,\u201d Mr. Obama said in describing his executive action. Republicans criticized the move as presidential overreach. \u201cThe action he\u2019s proposed would ignore the law, would reject the voice of the voters, and would impose new unfairness on law-abiding immigrants\u2014all without solving the problem,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Obama said his move was well-grounded in law and precedent and challenged Republicans to pass a bill if they don\u2019t like it. He noted contributions immigrants make to the nation, and said it was neither realistic nor desirable to deport all 11.3 million undocumented immigrants.  He also rejected accusations that his policy amounts to amnesty, and said it would rightly deport those who represent real threats. \u201cFelons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s plan contained only minor benefits for businesses that crave more visas for foreign workers and which have lobbied unsuccessfully for action in Congress. A new program will expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria. But White House officials said they opted against a plan, favored by high-tech companies, to make visas available from those unused in prior years, after concluding they couldn\u2019t justify it legally."]
["Politics and Policy", "By giving work papers to millions of illegal workers, Mr. Obama\u2019s plan could affect businesses in unexpected ways, enabling workers to seek new jobs and higher wages to the benefit of some business sectors more than others. Some in agriculture, for example, worried that affected workers would leave for other sectors. A 1986 law, which offered legal status to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants, had an almost immediate labor-market impact, with many low-wage workers moving to other jobs that pay better. Senior administration officials said the legal justification for Mr. Obama\u2019s plan was based on the principle of prosecutorial discretion\u2014there are insufficient resources to target all 11.3 million illegal immigrants, so the administration can assert priorities. Advocates for immigrants, who lobbied Mr. Obama to act without waiting for approval from lawmakers, planned celebrations and rallies across the country. A crowd gathered outside the gates of the White House shouting, \u201cSi se pudo!\u201d or \u201cYes we could!\u201d in Spanish. In an East Los Angeles immigrant enclave, people were tuned in to Spanish-language television at mom and pop shops. Univision offered simultaneous translation of the president\u2019s speech into Spanish.  \u201cI feel like everything I did now is paying off,\u201d said Martha Sanchez Almaraz, of Shakopee, Minn., who advocated for the change and stands to benefit from it. Two of her three children are U.S. citizens. \u201cSometimes, I felt like this would never happen.\u201d "]
["Politics and Policy", "As a candidate, Mr. Obama had vowed to make an immigration overhaul a priority in his first year. That didn\u2019t happen. He pushed for legislation as his second term opened, but a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate died in the GOP-run House. Now, with two years left in office, Mr. Obama has turned to unilateral action. But the new protections in the executive action are temporary and the entire policy could be reversed by a future president. Republicans in Congress have been looking for ways to block implementation of the Obama policy. Many have suggested using legislation that must pass by Dec. 11, needed to keep the government funded, as a vehicle for enacting limits on Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.  That idea hit a roadblock Thursday when the House Appropriations Committee said that Congress can\u2019t defund the primary agency involved in Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, because it is self-funded by fees. In fact, the agency could continue operating even if the rest of the government shut down. Some GOP lawmakers favor filing a lawsuit, challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Obama\u2019s action. Others suggested potentially withholding funding for other parts of the president\u2019s agenda. Mr. Obama\u2019s action raised the question of whether immigration legislation was now dead for the rest of his term\u2014as GOP leaders said his unilateral action would \u201cpoison the well\u201d in working with Congress\u2014or whether it created new pressures for lawmakers to revisit the issue."]
["Politics and Policy", "Some lawmakers said Congress may respond to Mr. Obama by renewing efforts to pass legislation, likely in piecemeal fashion, as many Republicans have advocated. \u201cCongress needs to re-establish its authority in this,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson (R., Idaho). \u201cUltimately, we\u2019ve got to solve the problem, so why not just start doing it?\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said the president\u2019s actions are \u201ca forcing mechanism. Republicans can sit down and negotiate with us tomorrow to make this executive action last all of a few weeks.\u201d The executive action satisfies few priorities of business groups, which are now regrouping. Mr. Obama\u2019s new policy will allow companies to employ certain workers who are waiting for their visas to clear, and it will expand a program that helps foreign students who have graduated and are awaiting work visas. Unions complained about both provisions, but they fall well short of legislative changes that business wants: more legal visas for high-skilled and low-skilled workers.  \u201cRepublicans will have an opportunity in the next Congress to put forward bills to address our dysfunctional immigration system,\u201d said U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes.  The most controversial part of the plan is a new \u201cdeferred action\u201d program, which gives a temporary reprieve from deportation and the chance to apply for work permits. Parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents will be eligible for the program. To qualify, they will have to undergo a background check and pay application fees."]
["Politics and Policy", "In addition, the administration is expanding criteria for an existing program that gives the same benefits to young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, sometimes called Dreamers, making about 270,000 people newly eligible.  However, senior administration officials said they couldn\u2019t legally justify giving shelter to the parents of these young people. They said that Congress had recognized the importance of the relationship between children and their immigrant parents, in that citizens are able to sponsor their parents for green cards. But there is no such justification for the parents of Dreamers, who have no legal status of their own, they said. For similar reasons, they said, they considered but didn\u2019t create a special program for farm workers. \u201cIt\u2019s a bittersweet moment for us,\u201d said Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez, a Brazilian immigrant who was raised in Florida and has legal protections under the existing program. \u201cMany people who got us to this point won\u2019t have the relief of knowing their parents are protected from deportation.\u201d The plan also makes changes to the enforcement regime. Under newly crafted guidelines, gang members, those with serious criminal convictions and people who crossed the border after Jan. 1, 2014, will top the list of priorities for deportation. People with only minor immigration violations or traffic convictions, but no other offenses, will no longer be targeted, officials said. It wasn\u2019t clear whether deportations, which have hit record numbers under Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, would drop under the new policy. Most of the people deported in recent years would have qualified as priorities for deportation under the new rules."]
["Politics and Policy", "The president was also replacing the Secure Communities program, which mandates that local law enforcement detain illegal immigrants and notify federal authorities. Under the new program, immigration enforcement officials will be notified, but people won't be held for any extra time. \u2014Kristina Peterson and Miriam Jordan contributed to this article.

["Experiential", "Magnesium brings something significant to auto designers: the ease at which it can be molded with thick and thin areas on the same part. It opens the door to cutting waste and allows designers to do more shaping. In the Pacifica\u2019s case, pockets were molded into the liftgate so taillights could be an integral part.  \u201cThe cool thing about magnesium is that you can use it in more parts of a vehicle architecture to reduce weight without compromising safety and performance,\u201d said Joe Petrillo,  director of North American sales for a unit of Wanfeng Auto Holding Group, which builds the Pacifica\u2019s liftgate.

The vehicle makes its debut as buyers are flocking to pickups, a move undercutting some of the average fuel-economy gains achieved in the last decade. With much tougher emissions standards looming for 2025, many auto makers are introducing electrified vehicles or using lighter, more-expensive materials, such as aluminum."]
["Experiential", "\nFord Motor\n Co.\u2019s\n      current F-150 pickup uses aluminum body panels to save up to 700 pounds over earlier, steel-bodied versions, and\n            General Motors\n Co.\n      is expected to employ aluminum in future versions of its trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Magnesium is a costly alternative. A kilogram of the metal costs auto makers roughly $3.75, while the same amount of aluminum costs $1.54. Steel costs between 40 cents and 98 cents per kilogram, depending on the grade, according to industry data.

A lighter lift gate can lead to smaller brackets or even a smaller motor to open the door. Take enough weight out of a vehicle and an auto maker might be able to reduce the size of the engine, too. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s fastest-selling products are hefty Jeep SUVs and Ram pickup trucks, placing near the bottom of industry ratings for real-world fuel economy and emissions performance, according to the EPA. Some analysts have questioned whether the company has adequate plans to address the problem. Sergio Marchionne,  the company\u2019s chief executive, has said the industry may not meet 2025 standards, particularly with gasoline prices so low."]
["Experiential", "The Pacifica\u2019s lift gate indicates the company isn\u2019t throwing in the towel. \u201cWhen we started to look at designing a new minivan we already knew we had to find ways to cut the weight,\u201d said Pacifica lead engineer Jessica LaFond. Magnesium, which is heated and poured into a cast mold, gave designers flexibility to style a more attractive back end. And they were able to reduce the need for additional parts, such as brackets, while adding inset taillights and a slightly larger back window. Ms. LaFond said the auto maker is studying whether to expand the use of magnesium in other Fiat Chrysler models. A magnesium liftgate for the Chrysler Pacifica is moved by robot into a machine that stamps out holes on each part.Photo: Nick King for The Wall Street Journal Lighter materials that are often more expensive are becoming more common in car designs. Since 2009, the percentage of aluminum as a component of vehicle weight has shot up 17% to 379 pounds a vehicle, or nearly 10% of the total. Carbon-fiber composites also are showing up in some vehicles, but auto makers are reluctant to commit to the expensive material.\n            BASF\n AG\u2019s\n      new carbon fiber oil pan is 40% lighter than steel or aluminum versions, for instance, but the company is still looking for a buyer.

["Technology", "Apple\u2019s HomePod speaker, which was introduced at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, will cost $349, nearly double the cost of Amazon\u2019s $180 Echo speaker. The 7-inch cylindrical speaker will be available in December. Amazon is estimated to have sold about $1 billion in speakers in about two years in the U.S., and the category is still growing, according to Michael R. Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Apple\u2019s diving into it. Apple\u2019s trying to sell more hardware because its iPhone sales at least in the U.S. have started to plateau,\u201d he said.  Amazon\u2019s Echo, introduced in late 2014, helped turn stand-alone speakers into gadgets that could double as a command station for the home. Alphabet followed with Google Home in 2016, and others are crowding into the space, including Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Cortana assistant, which will be used in a forthcoming speaker from Harman International Industries Inc. About 36 million Americans will use a voice-enabled speaker at least once a month this year\u2014more than twice as many as a year ago\u2014according to eMarketer, a market-research firm. The virtual assistants that power those speakers are increasingly being linked to everything from refrigerators to thermostats\u2014devices that aren\u2019t part of Apple\u2019s ecosystem. More than 4 billion consumer devices by the end of 2017 will make use of some kind of digital assistant, according to IHS Markit."]
["Technology", "As the category grew, Apple continued to emphasize its iPhone, noting that unlike a speaker gadget, its smartphone travels with users and is capable of using Siri to perform many of the same tasks. Still, the category posed a risk to Apple, giving people who may not want to be tethered to their phone at all times a reason to potentially shift to a rival\u2019s speaker.   With the HomePod, Apple is taking a different approach than its peers, emphasizing its sound quality and ability to play music over its ability to perform tasks. The HomePod\u2019s introduction Monday capped a two-hour-plus keynote event headlined by Chief Executive Tim Cook. Apple also used the gathering in San Jose, Calif., to show a new screen design for its iPad Pro and a series of upgrades to its line of Mac computers.  As it has in past product announcements, Apple stressed privacy as a hallmark of the device. It said communication with the HomePod and Siri will be encrypted and disassociated from the user after six months to protect privacy\u2014an aspect it hopes differentiates HomePod from Amazon\u2019s Echo and Alexa, which keep voice interactions until asked to discard them. Siri will serve as the operating system for the HomePod, playing requested songs and controlling home products like lamps programmed to work with Apple devices."]
["Technology", "Siri is both an asset and a liability for Apple. The assistant is available in 21 languages and 36 countries, making it possible for Apple to quickly expand HomePod beyond its initial markets\u2014the U.S., the U.K. and Australia\u2014and into countries like South Korea, the Netherlands and Russia. Google Assistant is available in seven languages, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa currently speaks English and German. However, Apple has been slow to open Siri to outside developers. Last year, it made Siri available to about a half-dozen types of apps such as ride-hailing and payment services\u2014a contrast to Alexa, which has more than 12,000 voice-activated apps that allow users to play trivia games like \u201cJeopardy\u201d on command or order pizza from restaurants that partner with Amazon. Apple is \u201cat risk of losing the lead by underestimating the value of third-party apps,\u201d said Gary Morgenthaler, a venture capitalist and Apple shareholder who invested in Siri before Apple acquired it in 2010. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising because Apple invented the App Store.\u201d The HomePod is the third major piece of hardware that Apple has launched since Mr. Cook assumed leadership of the company in 2011. The Apple Watch, which launched in 2015, has failed to drive the type of widespread consumer demand of the iPhone, and AirPods, the wireless headphones introduced in September, have been challenged by production issues. In unveiling the HomePod, Apple said little about how the device would work in running the home. It didn\u2019t, for example, say whether the gadget would work with Apple TV, the company\u2019s streaming video box, or whether it understands the distinct voices of different members of the family, who might be using different digital calendars. "]
["Technology", "Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research, expects the HomePod to do well with Apple\u2019s loyal consumers but struggle to grab a significant chunk of the market because of its premium price. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller,  who introduced the HomePod Monday, said it would reinvent the way people listen to music in their homes. It features an Apple-designed woofer for bass and can adjust the sound it projects based on a room\u2019s acoustics. \u201cIt has incredible clarity and precision,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.  A prototype of Apple's new HomePod is displayed during the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center Monday in San Jose, Calif. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images On Monday, Apple also announced an updated iPad Pro that it hopes can end a three-year slide in its tablet sales. By thinning the device\u2019s bezel, Apple said it increased screen size by about 20% to 10.5 inches. It also said it improved refresh rates to make playing videos smoother and crisper. Apple also unveiled a new iMac Pro desktop that will feature more powerful processors that improve computing speed and graphics. Its MacBook Pro and MacBook also are getting chip upgrades and its MacBook Air is getting an updated processor. On the software front, Apple Pay is being updated to allow users to send money to friends and family within iMessage. Apple also showed its growing interest in augmented reality with a developer platform called ARKit that allows app makers to develop games and features for the iOS 11, its new mobile software."]

["NBA", "In return for their franchise player, who could have opted out of his contract this summer to become a free agent, the Clippers are getting Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, other fringe players on non-guaranteed contracts and a first-round pick from the Rockets. The sign-and-trade was only possible after Paul agreed to a one-year player option on his contract, according to The Vertical, which first reported the deal. That sounds like semantics, but it amounts to a $50 million difference, because it allows Paul to sign a five-year deal with the Rockets worth about $200 million next summer due to a clause in the league\u2019s new collective-bargaining agreement. Players used to be prohibited from signing long-term contracts past their 36th birthdays until Paul, who is now 32, increased the age to 38 as the president of the players\u2019 union.  There are two big questions in the immediate aftermath of this trade. What does this mean for the Rockets, and what does this mean for the rest of the NBA?  The one thing that hasn\u2019t changed about basketball in recent years is the number of basketballs. There is still only one. Paul and Harden have to learn how to share.  That\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s a good problem, but it\u2019s still a problem, and it\u2019s not the only one. Paul slows the game down, for example, while Harden exploded this year by playing fast. They could fail spectacularly without an experimental, unorthodox solution, and there are few people in the NBA as comfortable with experimental, unorthodox solutions as Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni and general manager Daryl Morey. "]
["NBA", "Paul is one of the greatest point guards in NBA history. Harden didn\u2019t even consider himself a point guard at this time last year. D\u2019Antoni can stagger them to make sure he keeps an elite ball-handler on the court for every second of every game. But when they play together, they might work best with a crazy idea: Paul, not Harden, becoming more of a shooting guard.  D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system worked so well last year because the Rockets surrounded Harden with shooters, giving him the space to create shots for himself and create even better shots for his teammates. Of the four players with the most catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last year, three played for the Rockets.

["Autos", "That comes despite clear signs overall demand for passenger vehicles is weakening. April is expected to mark the fourth straight monthly decline in U.S. vehicle sales when the industry reports volumes on Tuesday, raising the likelihood that 2017 will end a seven-year run of increases. Industry observers say they don\u2019t expect a collapse in sales, even if demand drifts below record levels hit last year. \u201cTotal sales are still strong from a historical perspective and the decline is very gradual,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell,  an analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto-research firm and car-shopping website. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t really be seen as alarming.\u201d Auto makers say they\u2019ll stay disciplined and trim production levels to reflect weaker demand instead of cutting prices to keep their factories humming. GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler are in a relatively stronger position than some of their foreign-based rivals because they rely less on sales of sedans, which are in free fall as buyers switch to crossover wagons, SUVs and pick-up trucks. U.S. brands specialize in those vehicles, which tend to offer high profit margins. \u201cThe industry shift that we\u2019re seeing around the world from cars and [into] SUVs plays to our strengths,\u201d said Mark Fields,  Ford\u2019s chief executive officer, on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. The shift toward light trucks\u2014a category that includes pickups, SUVs and crossover wagons\u2014is helping auto makers keep prices high overall, even as they dole out bigger discounts on cars.\u00a0In recent months, light trucks have accounted for more than\u00a060%\u00a0of total sales volume. J.D. Power, a market-data provider, says the average price paid by buyers from the start of the year through mid-April was a record $31,380."]
["Autos", "While all three Detroit auto makers posted profits that surpassed Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations in the first quarter, Ford\u2019s earnings dropped by more than a third compared to the same period last year, when it debuted the latest iteration of its F-150 truck model. Detroit auto makers\u2019 growing exposure to those more expensive and typically less fuel-efficient cars and trucks could prove disastrous if consumers become more sensitive to gas-pump and sticker prices. For two years now, auto-industry insiders have been girding for the end of an unusually long upward sales cycle, which began in 2010 as the U.S. was emerging from the Great Recession. Tame gas prices, cheap credit and pent-up demand from consumers who put off car purchases in the bad times have converged to fuel the run. Clouds have started to appear on the horizon, including rising discounts, cratering used-car prices and overflowing dealership lots. Concern spread when March sales dipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.6 million, the slowest in two years. \u201cThe competitive intensity is increasing,\u201d Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said on a call with analysts. Mr. Marchionne said he is watching North American inventory levels \u201clike a hawk,\u201d but that he doesn\u2019t expect spending on sales incentives to spark a price war like the one hat started in 2007 and sent the industry into a tailspin. \u201cWe\u2019ve all collectively developed enough sense now not to cause repetition of the problem that we saw\u201d a decade ago, he said."]
["Autos", "Concern about rising spending by auto makers to maintain sales growth may be overblown, Barclays Capital said in a recent research note. Industry incentives as a percentage of average transaction prices came to 11.2% in the first half of April, the lowest level since June, the brokerage said. \u00a0\u201cA big driver of the improvement is GM, which is pulling back on incentives despite elevated inventories,\u201d it said. In recent months, market watchers have pointed to GM\u2019s inventory as among the most visible signs of trouble. The nation\u2019s largest auto maker ended March with a 98-day supply of vehicles, versus 71 days a year earlier. GM finance chief Chuck Stevens told analysts the company built up stocks of some SUV models ahead of scheduled down time at several factories this summer and fall, and said inventory will return to normal later in the year.

["Technology", "Behind the swift action from the firms lie considerations about freedom of speech and the legal application of company policy, which seems to vary depending on who the end user is. Companies that are considered communications platforms have the greatest leeway to enforce policies that bar certain users, legal experts say.

Recently, the debate about what kind of speech tech firms allow on their platforms has focused on companies such as Facebook, which has hosted fake news as well as violent live videos, and Twitter, which has ramped up efforts to remove some accounts from its site.  Following the violence in Virginia, domain registrars\u2014which act as intermediaries by making sure that a website\u2019s domain name is linked to the correct IP address\u2014have also become arbiters of free speech.

["Business", "Steel has always been cheaper and stronger than aluminum. But conventional steel is heavy. Many car makers seeking to comply with tougher fuel economy requirements have shifted in recent years to aluminum and other light materials like carbon fiber. Now, steel makers have figured out how to make steel lighter without compromising its strength or versatility. \u201cEverything is moving to thinner and lighter,\u201d said Mark Bula, chief commercial officer at Big River Steel. a mill that opened in Arkansas last year. \u201cThe steel industry is moving that way as well.\u201d On next year\u2019s Audi A8, steel will make up 40% of the metal in the passenger-compartment frame, up from 8% eight years ago.  By 2025, the amount of lightweight, high-strength steel in a car or light truck in North America is projected to rise to an average 483 pounds, 76% above the 2015 average, according to industry consultancy Ducker Worldwide. \nArcelorMittal\n            \n      N.V. \u00a0expects auto makers\u2019 global demand for press-hardened steel sheet, which is strong and malleable for complex stamped parts, to grow 36% by 2020 to 3.7 million metric tons.  The company, the world\u2019s largest steel maker, began producing a new generation of super-strong steel at its mill in Calvert, Ala., this year. And it plans to open a plant in Detroit late this year\u2014the third of its kind in the U.S.\u2014to weld and heat-treat multiple pieces of lightweight steel of varying strength grades and thicknesses into a single sheet."]
["Business", "Sheets from these plants are stamped into large components, such as door frames, that feature some sections with extra-strong steel and others with steel that has less strength but is easier to bend. The 2017 Chrysler Pacifica\u2019s two front-door frames are each made of five pieces of steel with three different thicknesses. The door frames shaved 22 pounds off the vehicle, Fiat Chrysler said. Aluminum remains in wide use with auto manufacturers looking to reduce a vehicle\u2019s weight. Even as lighter steel gains popularity, aluminum is expected to continue replacing heavier-steel varieties.  Aluminum content in cars and light trucks in North America is expected to reach an average of 520 pounds in 2025, a 31% increase from 2015, according to Ducker Worldwide. More than two-thirds of closure components, such as hoods and trunk lids, on light vehicles are expected to be aluminum by 2020, double from 2016. \u201cHigh-strength steel has some inherent properties that are tough to escape from. It\u2019s three times heavier\u201d than aluminum, said \u00a0Svein Richard Brandtzaeg,  chief executive of Norwegian aluminum producer\n            Norsk Hydro\n AS\n      A. Aluminum\u2019s penetration into the auto industry is experiencing some growing pains. Auto makers in Japan are scrambling to check the safety of their aluminum components after one of Japan\u2019s biggest aluminum suppliers,\n            Kobe Steel\n Ltd.\n      , this week disclosed that quality-control paperwork for auto customers had been doctored."]
["Business", "Still, steel remains cheaper than aluminum. To maintain that edge, analysts say steel companies have refrained from maximizing profits on the new high-strength steel grades as they work to draw customers back from aluminum. North Carolina-based\n            Nucor\n Corp.\n      , whose electric furnaces were once derided as insufficient for making automotive-grade steel, now sells nearly a fifth of its annual production volume to auto makers. \u201cOur industry has gotten a wakeup call the last couple of years because of aluminum,\u201d said Nucor\u2019s Chief Executive John Ferriola. \u201cIn the battle against aluminum, steel is going to come out very well.\u201d \u2014Chester Dawson contributed to this article. \n              {{summary.headline}}\n             THANKS FOR READING The Wall Street Journal Continue Reading Your Article With a WSJ Membership Copyright \u00a92017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

["Review & Outlook (U.S.)", "The bigger price in the deal is that the DUP forced Mrs. May to abandon her plans to reform pensions. As a result, pensions will continue to rise each year by the highest of consumer-price inflation, wage growth or 2.5%. Though it\u2019s impossible to predict how much this will cost in the future, one clue is that, since David Cameron introduced the policy in 2010, it has cost up to \u00a36 billion a year more compared to what it would have been if pensions were indexed solely to earnings growth. The DUP also has nixed Tory plans to means-test winter-fuel subsidies for the elderly. This is a less-expensive give-away, but the symbolism is bad. The Conservatives are admitting they\u2019re no longer the party of entitlement reform. After losing seats in the election, Mrs. May\u2019s Tories needed to find some way to govern so that Labour and its far-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn,  don\u2019t.

The attorney general has pledged to withhold federal money from cities that don\u2019t cooperate, similar to how previous administrations have held back highway funds during debates over the speed limit and drinking age. But it wasn\u2019t immediately clear to the cities why they were targeted.

The company sharpened its focus on Asia after canceling plans to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion in April, following objections from regulators. The theme-park business is growing rapidly in the region, especially in China.

Six Flags Entertainment Corp. said last year that it would build multiple Six Flags parks in China over the next decade, while Chinese property company Dalian Wanda Group Co. is establishing more than a dozen amusement parks.

Two other companies together have raised nearly $70 million for real estate investments, while a community bank with operations in three Southern states has issued stock for a merger deal. "]
["Small Business", "The new rules, known as Reg A+, reduce the legal and reporting requirements for making these offerings. The rules, which took effect last June, grew out of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, aimed at spurring business growth and employment. \u201cThe big issue is there has been a rush of companies and not enough gratification,\u201d said Rod Turner,  chief executive of Manhattan Street Capital Inc., a funding platform for the offerings.  According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 94 companies had filed to raise a total of $1.7 billion under Reg A+ as of early June. Of those, 45 offerings seeking to raise a total of $785 million have qualified to raise funds, and just a few have actually completed their offerings.  The low tally highlights some of the challenges that small companies continue to face, as well as the JOBS Act\u2019s limited progress in achieving its objectives. But the weak market for initial public offerings hasn\u2019t helped.  Among the biggest problems for the companies trying to raise funds is that they aren\u2019t prepared for the amount of marketing needed to attract a big enough pool of potential investors.  In some cases, companies set overoptimistic minimums for the amount needed to complete the offering, and then had to return money to investors after falling short of their goal. Another hurdle: attorneys and broker-dealers are still getting comfortable with the new fund-raising option."]

There have been other hitches. The SEC increased the amount companies could raise without providing audited financial statements to $20 million from $5 million.

Roughly half of the 50 states require audited or reviewed financial statements for offerings exceeding $1 million, according to Michael Pieciak,  Vermont\u2019s deputy commissioner of securities. After its $5 million offering was qualified to begin raising funds under Reg A+, Broadcast 3DTV Inc., a Burbank, Calif., developer of 3D software and hardware, had to get its financial results audited.

["U.S. News", "Prosecutors allege that Evgeny Buryakov,  also known as \u201cZhenya,\u201d worked at the Manhattan office of a Russian bank to disguise his true purpose in the U.S. In fact, according to prosecutors, 39-year-old Mr. Buryakov worked as an agent of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, known as the SVR, and his bank job was merely \u201cnonofficial cover\u201d for his spying.  Mr. Buryakov lives in New York City with his wife and two children.  He was arrested Monday morning in the Bronx and was denied bail by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn at his arraignment, where he was represented by federal defender Sabrina Shroff. \u201cHis cover has now been blown,\u201d Judge Netburn said, adding that he has \u201cevery incentive to flee.\u201d The website of Vnesheconombank, a state-controlled company, lists Mr. Buryakov as its deputy representative in New York.

Prosecutors also alleged that Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy, Mr. Buryakov\u2019s handlers, were sent to New York by the SVR. But because Mr. Sporyshev acted as a Russian trade representative and Mr. Podobnyy served as an attach\u00e9 for Russia\u2019s U.N.

The charges come at a low point in relations between the U.S. and Russia. Tensions between the countries have run high over Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine and sanctions the U.S. and allies have imposed in response. Those sanctions were of particular interest to the alleged spies, according to a complaint and a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit unsealed Monday. The charges stem from a multiyear investigation into a group of 10 other covert Russian agents who were living secret lives for years in American suburbs like Rosslyn, Va., and Yonkers, N.Y., according to the FBI.  All pleaded guilty to money-laundering conspiracy charges after their arrest in June 2010. A few months after their arrest, the FBI opened an investigation into the three men charged in Monday\u2019s complaint, according to prosecutors. The FBI started tailing Mr. Buryakov and recording his calls around March 2012, and prosecutors say he was spotted dozens of times slipping a bag, magazine or slip of paper to Mr. Sporyshev in outdoor locations. Prosecutors also recorded calls between Messrs. Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussing Mr. Buryakov\u2019s intelligence gathering, which appeared primarily focused on economic information."]

After the source mentioned that a potential project in Russia could be affected by U.S. sanctions and that he had a contact in the U.S. government, Mr. Buryakov expressed interest in further information about the sanctions. At Mr. Buryakov\u2019s request, the source gave him a list of Russians who had been sanctioned by the U.S. Weeks later, Mr. Buryakov asked Mr. Sporyshev whether he had received \u201cthe schoolbooks\u201d and arranged a meeting with him. In a call recorded by the FBI, Messrs.

["U.S. News", "\u201cWe believe that it is imperative that we be prepared\u2014and for every disaster in today\u2019s world\u2014that includes a nuclear attack,\u201d said Gov. David Ige, a Democrat. \u201cWe want to make sure that the public is informed.\u201d The implementation of the attack tone in Hawaii comes as tensions with North Korea have escalated. Around 4,600 miles separate Hawaii from North Korea, making it\u2014with Alaska\u2014among the closest U.S. states to the country. North Korea test-fired a single ballistic missile in the early hours of\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0morning local time, according to South Korean authorities, the first such provocation since September.

The new \u201cattack warning\u201d tone,\u00a0which will be heard for the first time\u00a0Friday, will have a distinct, wavering sound, officials said. That signal will indicate residents should seek immediate shelter. Officials with the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency in July rolled out a public awareness campaign aimed at educating people on how to respond to an attack. The agency has held various town halls instructing residents how to create preparedness plans and properly shelter in place.

["Markets Main", "While Mr. Dimon didn\u2019t advocate \u201cto throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules\u201d he did say he thinks it is \u201cappropriate to open up the rulebook.\u201d The head of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets doesn\u2019t have the power to change these rules, but he does sit on President Donald Trump\u2019s business council of 16 top executives and knows some of Mr. Trump\u2019s high-level finance advisers. Any changes are likely to help the bank. Mr. Dimon wrote that the \u201canticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment\u201d in addition to the bank\u2019s results are among the reasons its stock price jumped about 30% in 2016. Mr.. Dimon has previously said that rules should be coordinated among agencies, simplified and consistent, but in Tuesday\u2019s letter spelled out what that meant for the first time.  He said banks have too much capital and that could be used instead to safely finance the economy.  To be sure, Mr. Dimon also highlighted the benefits of a safer and stronger banking system because of higher capital, liquidity, more disclosure and transparency, and stress testing, among other changes. But he said some of those have gone too far. For instance, Mr. Dimon thinks one constraint on banks, rules around the so-called supplementary leverage ratio, \u201cneed to be modified.\u201d These rules, which limit the amount of borrowed money a bank can use in relation to its overall assets, often penalize \u201cfairly risk-free activity\u201d and should instead promote lending and liquid capital markets, Mr. Dimon argued in the letter."]
["Markets Main", "He also said that operational risk capital should be \u201csignificantly modified, if not eliminated\u201d since it isn\u2019t always calculated fairly or in coordination with other capital rules. Mr. Dimon said banks in the U.S. hold around $200 billion in operational risk capital but if a bank exits a business that created the risk, it is likely required to still hold that capital. Mr. Dimon reiterated that the so-called \u201cgold plating\u201d of international standards by U.S. regulators should be eliminated. Making U.S. rules stronger than international rules was in some cases a priority of Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo,  who was the central bank\u2019s regulatory point person but is stepping down this week. For instance, a removal of the \u201cgold plating\u201d surcharge applied to Globally Systemic Important Banks would free up what he estimated is about $15 billion of equity capital, an amount Mr. Dimon said could support around $190 billion of loans. Mr. Dimon also suggested reforms to the mortgage market since the housing sector has been \u201cunusually slow to recover.\u201d He highlighted that seven major federal regulators and many more state and local regulators have overlapping jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote new rules, some of which are beneficial and others that aren\u2019t coordinated.  \u201cThe result is a complex, highly risky and unpredictable operating environment that exposes lenders and servicers to disproportionate legal liability and materially increases operational risks and costs,\u201d he wrote."]
["Markets Main", "He called, for example, on the Federal Housing Administration to make more selective use of the False Claims Act to go after firms that make loans that sour. That would be a first step toward increasing bank participation in the market for FHA loans, which is now dominated by nonbank lenders. Mr. Dimon also called for a return of private capital to make the housing-finance market less taxpayer dependent, and new national servicing standards to replace current complex arrangements around the servicing or mortgages. \u201cIf we do this right, we believe the mortgage market could add more than $300 billion a year in new purchased loans,\u201d he wrote in the letter. While Mr. Dimon reiterated his confidence in the U.S., he also said, related to slower economic growth and lower productivity, \u201cit is clear that something is wrong\u2014and it\u2019s holding us back.\u201d He suggested public policy changes, with a focus on education, infrastructure, corporate taxes and the U.S. legal system. Some of those issues have been discussed in President Trump\u2019s business council\u2019s first meeting in February. But those suggestions didn\u2019t take away from his optimism about the company, a consistent message Mr. Dimon shares. He said the bank has opportunities for organic growth, a noticeable change from past years when the bank held steady amid heightened regulatory supervision.  For instance, Mr. Dimon said the bank can grow by selectively adding investment and private bankers around the world; growing its consumer and commercial banking branches in the U.S.; and adding wholesale branches overseas, including expanding \u201ccarefully\u201d into new countries."]

["Mind & Matter", "Our sophisticated grown-up understanding of other people develops through a long process of learning and experience. But babies may have more of a head start than we imagine. A new study by Andrew Meltzoff and his colleagues at the University of Washington, published in January in the journal Developmental Science, finds that our connection to others starts very early. Dr. Meltzoff has spent many years studying the way that babies imitate the expressions and actions of other people. Imitation suggests that babies do indeed connect their own internal feelings to the behavior of others. In the new study, the experimenters looked at how this ability is reflected in baby\u2019s brains. Studies with adults have shown that some brain areas activate in the same way when I do something as when I see someone else do the same thing. But, of course, adults have spent many years watching other people and experiencing their own feelings. What about babies? The trouble is that studying babies\u2019 brains is really hard. The typical adult studies use an FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine: Participants have to lie perfectly still in a very noisy metal tube. Some studies have used electroencepholography to measure baby\u2019s brain waves, but EEG only tells you when a baby\u2019s brain is active. It doesn\u2019t say where that brain activity is taking place."]
["Mind & Matter", "Dr. Meltzoff and colleagues have been pioneers in using a new technique called magnetoencephalography with very young babies. Babies sit in a contraption that\u2019s like a cross between a car seat and an old-fashioned helmet hairdryer. The MEG machine measures very faint and subtle magnetic signals that come from the brain, using algorithms to correct for a wriggling baby\u2019s movements. \n In this study, the experimenters used MEG with 71 very young babies\u2014only seven months old. They recorded signals from a part of the brain called the \u201csomatosensory\u201d cortex. In adults, this brain area is a kind of map of your body. Sensations in different body parts activate different \u201csomatosensory\u201d areas, which correspond to the arrangement of the body: Hand areas are near arm areas, leg areas are near feet. One group of babies felt a small puff of air on their hand or their foot. The brain activation pattern for hands and feet turned out to be different, just as it is for grown-ups. Then the experimenters showed other babies a video of an adult hand or foot that was touched by a rod. Surprisingly, seeing a touch on someone else\u2019s hand activated the same brain area as feeling a touch on their own hand, though more faintly. The same was true for feet. These tiny babies already seemed to connect their own bodily feelings to the feelings of others. These may be the first steps toward a fully-fledged theory of mind. Even babies, it turns out, don\u2019t just see bags of skin. We seem to be born with the ability to link our own minds and the minds of others. "]

J. Christopher Giancarlo,  the current acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a Republican commissioner since 2014, told the Senate Agriculture Committee he would focus on streamlining existing rules and improving the commission\u2019s data analysis, as well as embracing the use of financial technology in the market and at the CFTC. Mr. Giancarlo\u2019s confirmation still needs to be advanced by the agriculture committee and then go to the Senate floor for a vote. "]
["Financial Regulation", "The panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.), praised Mr. Giancarlo\u2019s tenure at the CFTC and noted that as commissioner, he had been confirmed by the committee unanimously and in the Senate by a voice vote, a procedure typically used for noncontroversial business.  Mr. Roberts expressed his hope that the White House would move to quickly nominate additional commissioners to the CFTC. The commission currently has just two members\u2014Mr. Giancarlo and Democratic Commissioner Sharon Bowen, who on Tuesday said she planned to step down in the coming months. The White House has already announced the nominations of two Republicans; Mr. Roberts said he would prefer to have one hearing for all four new commissioners: two Republicans and two Democrats, in accordance with Senate custom. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shake the tree at the White House to get the other nominees forward. If we can do that right after the July break\u2026that would be very helpful,\u201d Mr. Roberts told reporters after the hearing, referring to Congress\u2019s planned recess the week of July 4. The dearth of commissioners makes it highly unlikely for the CFTC to approve major new rules. Mr. Giancarlo promised to finish outstanding rules, such as position limits to prevent speculation, but practically speaking, he can\u2019t do so without at least three seats filled on the commission. Mr. Roberts was the only Republican senator present at the hearing, while other members of his party met elsewhere on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The proceedings went remarkably quickly for a confirmation hearing, lasting just under 40 minutes."]
["Financial Regulation", "Democrats on the committee pressed Mr. Giancarlo on whether his initiative to simplify rules\u2014officially dubbed the \u201cKiss\u201d initiative, for \u201cKeep it Simple, Stupid\u201d\u2014was simply a regulatory rollback by another name. Mr. Giancarlo assured them that the effort was focused only on relieving some of the compliance burdens and confusion faced by market participants, and that no rules would be rewritten as part of the project and the goal wasn\u2019t to dilute the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law.  \u201cProject Kiss is not about rolling back Dodd-Frank or Wall Street reforms in any shape of fashion,\u201d he said. He took pains to note his longstanding support for Dodd-Frank\u2019s Title VII, which gives the CFTC authority to regulate over-the-counter swaps markets. He did, however, reiterate his desire to rewrite the CFTC\u2019s swaps execution rules, which he has long argued have adverse effects on liquidity by limiting the venues counterparties can use to execute swap trades. Though Democrats pressed Mr. Giancarlo on whether he had coordinated with the Trump administration on a possible regulatory rollback (he said he hadn\u2019t), they praised him for breaking from the Trump administration by submitting the CFTC\u2019s own budget request to Congress, as is the prerogative of independent agencies. The Trump administration called for the CFTC\u2019s budget to be kept flat at $250 million, while the CFTC\u2019s budget called for an increase of $31.5 million. At a budget request hearing earlier this month, House Republicans signaled that they would give more credence to the Trump administration\u2019s budget request. Mr. Giancarlo repeated his position that the CFTC shouldn\u2019t be funded with user fees, as is the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission, because market participants must already pay transaction fees to self-regulatory organizations. Additional costs, he said, could have a negative impact on liquidity."]

The administration remains in the agreement, but it is looking to ratchet up pressure on Iran in other ways. A key target is Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has taken over broad swaths of the economy. Washington has threatened to sanction companies doing business with the IRGC.
